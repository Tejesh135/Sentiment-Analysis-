__label__2 I haven't buy this, but...: In flames es la neta asì que aunque no tenga este cd sè q està chido, y ahora si me disculpan, tengo que poner a esta obra maestra en mi Cart.In fgames kicks ass!
__label__1 Would not recommend: I bought this printer two years ago and it seemed noisy and erratic from the beginning. The cartridges seemed to run out very fast and were quite expensive. Now I will be buying a new printer as it has a hardware problem that is not worth fixing.I would recommend spending the extra money for a better printer. You will avoid chasing good money after bad later on.
__label__1 Former Dune Fan: OK - I am done with Dune. The original series, written by F. Herbert, was excellent - it was so well detailed and written that I could almost smell the spice. The Butlerian Jihad, however, has convinced me to move on. This work was poorly written, poorly thought out, and wordy instead of detailed; it was a silly book.The Titans, the evermind, the other thinking machines were all comic caricatures of what they could have been. The inane dialog was so mind-numbing, I had to struggle through each page.My advice: read ANYTHING else- anything. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity.
__label__1 The trailer fooled me for once.: This film was marketed like Stiller's return to good films. I saw many big posters while leaving theaters that had me waiting for this one. I couldn't watch it at the theater because it came and went so I rented it on blu ray. The most disappointing thing about the film is the central character, if only he was a little likable, this film could have been much more tolerable. The director should have had a more promising cast, the pace of the film was all over. This film didn't even have a saving grace other than the fact that it ends. This is not even worth watching on home box office.
__label__1 Did not like: I did not like this spray and gave it to a co-worker. I used it twice and had to stop. It left a gross film on my hair and did not make my hair smooth and silky.
__label__1 yuck: if one could synthesize all that is bad about the current music scene, the forlorn whining, the annoying vocals, the cookie cutter sounds, this is the band and the album you would have. and we do. YUCK
__label__1 bland: Larry, as always, displays fine technical skill, fluency, and articulation, as well as the occasional tasty choice of notes however, there is just too much of that, "wonder how long I'll be on hold on the phone?" or "when's my floor coming in the elevator" sound about it. Certainly disappointing when you consider some of this artists fine achievements with the likes of Steely Dan etc.
__label__1 Devastatingly disappointing: The first two books take you on an amazing, wonderful rollercoaster ride, only to have the third book hurl you into a whole other direction that is diappointing and confusing. I was so upset to fall in love with Lyra and Will to end up with a bunch of anti-God speeches and a sad ending. The anti-christian message in this book becomes apparent by the end of book two and just gets hammered in throughout book 3. At websites devoted to His Dark Materials there are quotes about Pullman using these books to counteract the Chronicles of Narnia and God. As a parent, I would be disturbed to have my young children (target audience) read how Man/Woman is the saviour of us all. There is no way a parent would know that this is what the books are really about. They are so beautifully written; the third book just broke my heart. If children read this, parents should read it with them. Lots to discuss.
__label__1 DANGEROUS- plastic and wire screen ended up in drink: After juicing for years, I purchased this item and it is being RETURNED IMMEDIATELY and I caution everyone to be very wary of this product/ 1st dat no problem- juiced carotts, celery, deseeded apples. 2nd day same ingredients-found small piece of plastic in drink when lip started bleeding! started to disassemble it and found wire screen had 1" hole in side and plastic pulp containter had 3' side chip- which I must have drank- only remaining plastic in drink was jagged edge piece about 1/2" very sharp. WROTE immediately to company who said if I wanted personal reply to my complaint, I had to write to ANOTHER address, did that and got rediredted AGAIN!! This is UNSAFE to use-CAUTION: DO NO BUY!!!
__label__2 Great tick repellent: For someone who has suffered through (if you ever really do) Lyme disease - this product has kept the ticks at bay!
__label__1 My Heart is Still Beating Just Fine: I swore after I read Fielding's prior - about a wife on the run and hiding in Ohio, I think - that I would never waste time on her again. Well, too bad I didn't recall my oath. "Heartstopper" is a serial killer type novel which drags on and on, with needless loose dialogue and very little suspense. A family relocates from upper NY to Florida when the dad has an online affair. The premise is weak and the wronged wife is even weaker. The students she teaches are all sterotypes and not worth a second look. I easily put down this book and only finished it by skimming. I figured out fairly easily half way through (in spite of obvious 'clues' to mislead the reader) who the killer was and I hate that. I do NOT want to figure out who done it. So many better writers out there, that I am sorry to say Joy Fielding must be resting on her earlier laurels. A shame. She is totally boring. I do believe I could write this book and that is not a compliment. Avoid it at all costs.
__label__2 Best Lifting Gloves for Women: These are absolutely THE BEST lifting gloves for women. The fingers are longer than any other gloves out there. Love that!! The leather is soft, eliminating the need to "break them in." The padding is enough to protect your hand without sacrificing the feel of the bar. Only criticism is the funky orangy color, but these gloves aren't about fashion.Remember when you order, these are sized and proportioned for a woman's hand and not a man's. I wear a size 5 ring and wear these gloves in a medium.
__label__1 There are better bottles out there: I was using DR. Browns bottles but I quickly found out I needed more. So I purchased Ventaire, I was disapointed and confused by it's design. My baby couldn't get enough milk from the nipples so I went out and bought a bigger size, he still wasn't satasfied. I use them for storage now. I never used other bottles besides Dr. Browns so these could be excellent...BUT I found Dr. Browns work a lot better, are less likely to break and are around the same price.
__label__2 Aubrey Organics: This is the best product that I have tried to date. Many other natural products due not last as long and I also liked the light fragrance.
__label__2 Super duper: A friend gave me this CD, and it is really great to pop in and get down to with a dizzying array of various styles of music transitioning perfectly from jazz flute to old school hip-hop. Triple J (Jjj) is a great DJ, and from what I hear he has been in a few Mixing Championships around the world. For the person with a diverse appreciation for music styles and classic pop sounds from diff. time periods and DJ skillz (oh yeah, i pulled out the Z). I like to listen to this CD while playing video games, but thats just me.
__label__1 Be aware of what you are purchasing: If you are mainly buying this release for the original versions, please be aware that they do not use the full resolution of the dvd format. They are merely copies of the Laser Discs from the early 1990's, and are not "enhanced for widescreen TV's". Buyer beware!
__label__2 Hilarious!: I'm soo glad my wife turned me on to this series. I've watched all of them now, I think. This one was one of the best tho.
__label__1 What a shame: Having read all of Mr Ellis's previous works, there is no doubt that they get worse with time. As another Amazon review points out they are basically the same story re-hashed.So Mr Ellis, as you do have a good grasp of the nilhist world in which we live and you can string together a great narrative, why don't you pull that finger out and write the novel that you are capable of?You never know, you might even enjoy it :-) Ho HumUnless you are real fan, I wouldn't really recommend reading this rather introverted and dull diatribe.
__label__2 Worst '80s album.: That's not saying much though. SOE is still good and enjoyable. They toned their sound down and it's less heavy and a lot lighter than Among the Living but still a decent follow-up. The songs are sslower and more melodic but it's still a metal album and it's definitely thrash. Out of Sight, Out of Mind is one of my favorite Anthrax songs. There's one thing that makes it a step down from ATL, it's the production. The songs are great and it's an album worth owning but it could use a remaster.
__label__1 Terrible; absolute waste of time.: Don't bother. Unfortunately it's under science fiction genre; thereby just giving it a bad name. Utter waste of time. Boring loser characters and drivel as a storyline. So much better entertainment out there. Rather watch "Dude, where's my car" if that's your sort of entertainment or watch proper science fiction.
__label__1 Not Much After Cry: Waterfront were a Welsh band that released this sole album in 1989. The band were a derivative of Wham and Clime Fisher. Their lone hit single in the US was "Cry" which peaked at number 10. It is a pleasant enough song, but hearing it you very well might think it was George Michael singing. Another song "Nature Of Love" sounds like it stole the rhythm of Johnny Hates Jazz "Shattered Dreams". The band slipped into obscurity soon after this release and were never really missed.
__label__2 Add style to your palm: The palm hard case adds some style to an already stylish palm v. It definitely stops the worries of having your palm screen scratched by keys or coins while in your pocket. The only mild complaint is that the cover is spring loaded but there's no latch to hold it completely closed.
__label__1 only a couple of good songs, rest is mediocre: i wouldn't have purchased it if i had listened to it a little further before turning in my cash. first song (straight line to the kerb) is good, second song (what you have is good) is okay. i couldn't care less for the rest of the songs.disappointment.
__label__2 my introduction to Balinese music: Like Ms Roden, I heard this not long after it was issued.I remember one night partying and someone put this on. Let us say that I was in for quite a surprise when I first heard Kecak, or as the Balinese call it 'Cak'. This is a massive chorus of male voices singing powerful rhythms.The gamelan piece is Gong Kebyar, which is the most common gamelan at the time of this recording. This performance is nothing special, there probably are others out that are more ambitious.
__label__1 A disturbing waste of money: Because I am extra serious about hypertension, I bought this wrist monitor to double check my upper arm monitor, even though my upper arm monitor was checked at my doctor's office. While my upper arm monitor showed readings with consistency, this wrist monitor displayed wildly fluctuating readings within a matter of 10 minutes, although I followed the instructions with mathematical accuracy, including moving away from cell phones and other electronics items. If I didn't have the upper arm monitor to reassure me, I would have called 911, thinking I was on the verge of a circulatory episode. The bottom line: get an upper arm monitor and have it checked at your doctor's office.
__label__1 Buy A Kitten Harness with Mini Connectors Instead: I bought the Feather Tether Bird harness for my Cockatoo. This device works but is unnecessarily difficult to use. The metal clasps require you to use your fingernail to actuate, blindly under a feathered wing. The clasps swivel too, so it takes 5x as long to put this on your bird than a simple kitten harness with tough plastic connector mechanisms. My bird didn't mind the harness once it was on. And actually he liked the whole fiddling process because of all the extra attention. However, my patience was wearing out. I bought a similar styled kitten harness for less that uses the clip connectors you see on luggage except these are size appropriate. With 2 clips the kitten harness was on (3 swivel metal clips for the Feather Tether) and was equally suitable. The kitten harness came with a little bell which my Cockatoo removed after a few minutes.
__label__2 Good, but very dark: The book was good, except for the fact that it was very dark and dragged on in some parts. I think that the author could've let the demon posess people without them dying and getting blood everywhere. This book would be for kids about 9 - 14, but with some of the plot twists which are somewhat difficult to follow, and the nastiness of some of the deaths, I'd say 12 - 14.
__label__1 PAD IS WAY TOO HARD!: THIS IS A GREAT CONCEPT BUT THE PAD/SEAT IS SO HARD YOU MAY AS WELL KNEEL ON THE GROUND. THE LEGS/HANDLES HAVE NO PADDING AND IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE TO TRY TO GET UP. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT.
__label__1 This is the worst product I have ever used: Okay first all it only holds 450MB of Media. That's not that bad what makes the product horrible is that when you try to burn it an erro message come up saying the pvd is bad. Okay so I tried anonther one the same thing. I ran through at least 3 boxes before I got it to work, and my cd burner wasnt bad either I tried all of them in differnt cd burner drives nothing. This product is garbage.
__label__2 DVD Worked Great: The dvd played really well and I got it quicker than the expected delivery date. I was expecting the case to be in a little bit better condition than it was in, but it wasn't horrible.
__label__1 Terrible game - way over rated and won't work on a Mac: This game is old and has never been updated to run on Mac OS X properly.This not not an arcade came, it's a flight simulator, and without special control, you can't expect to operate it from a keyboard and mouse.It's slow, complicated, and very annoying.And then it crashes, repeatedly.Worse, I haven't been able to find any Joy Sticks or controls that work with Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).MacPro, 4 Gig RAM, ATI Radeon 2600
__label__2 Axe Body Wash: This is a Christmas present for my husband. I have had problems findingthis scent, Essence, in the stores. So, I was thrilled to see it onAmazon. The product was in brand new condition when I received it. Delivery was prompt. I'm very happy with my purchase. Thank you.
__label__1 Beware products in foreign languages.: When ordering a dvd from an English-language site, it would be reasonable to assume that it would contain English language dialogue or at the very least, subtitles in English especially when one knows that an English language version of the title is available. It mystifies me why a product with neither attribute is offered for sale in Amazon US or UK when there are Amazon sites specifically tailored to process products in foreign languages. At the very least, such dvds should have a notice right at the the top of the product entry informing us that it is not an English-language version or the title should be displayed in a foreign language. For me, ordering this useless article was a complete waste of time.
__label__2 Beautiful ending to a beautiful story.: Although it was not as good as the first and second series, it still held my attention and best of all the pace of the story never slows you down. I finished all these books within 2 days. These are the first books the author wrote that I read and it is sad to see so wonderful a book end. Keep it up and I will continue to buy more of your books. Thanks for these beautiful books.
__label__1 Printing Press Wedding Software: A complete waste of money.Not user friendly. Very limited package.Very dissapointed.
__label__2 Hamilton Beach 67650 Big Mouth Pro Juice Extractor: Works as advertized. Cleaning of juice separator basket does take some time but can be done effectively. Large mouth reduces need for cutting up items to be juiced.
__label__1 A Disappointment: A lot of words defined here, but still not complete. Mine is the 2003 V3.0 version and it does finally include "internet" -- but don't bother looking for "blog" as it is not there. Could the etymologies and histories be more complete? Yes. Other criticisms I read of this CD are also on the mark, as, for example, the absence of many of the print-version illustrations.There are a lot of search options that could be helpful. One of these claims to find homophones (homonyms). This version will find neither "bow" for "bough" nor "ruff" for "rough".Still a useful item for many purposes, but complete or unabridged it's not.
__label__1 Disappointing.: Another reviewer had expressed disappointment that the pictures (unlike the cover) are in black and white. I didn't think this would be a problem until I got my own Bad Cat calendar. The day pages are of such poor quality paper that the resolution on the B&W photos is poor. There are captions (not particularly funny) with each picture that cover most of the rest of the page, so there is no space to make notes on the calendar, if that's what you want it for. Color me disappointed.
__label__1 SAVE YOUR MONEY!: The software is defective and the author and publisher, in the unlikely event you can get either to respond, only cloud the issue with disingenuous assurances.
__label__1 Masterlock 379DAT is NOT Universal: I have a 6 year old premium bass boat trailer with 2 inch coupler and surge brakes. The tongue style is UFP. This lock does not fit snugly against the tongue...it angles away with a 1.5 inch gap. Someone could easily get a pry bar between the lock and the tongue. A thief may not remove the lock but they will seriously damage the tongue. I am going to get stuck with $13 in wasted shipping returning this junk. Don't make the same mistake!
__label__1 Did someone say Ian Curtis?: These guys rip off Joy Divison on every level. I'm sorry, but there is nothing exciting about Interpol. Buy a Joy Division record and ignore these guys.
__label__2 Amazing value: You honestly cannot beat these rails for the price. I have paid 5x as much for a rail thats inferior to this one. Buy them up before they go up in price.
__label__1 What was the point?: I give two stars here only for the soundtrack and for Ciaran Hinds.As for the rest, it really isn't a ghost story. It's a narrative mess, muddled and confusing, with the focus taken off of the main character and given to two others whose story is not interesting.Too bad it was so pointless. It could have been much better.
__label__1 DON'T BE SUCKED IN BY THE HYPE: I had been anticipating this film for months after a friend of mine was in a test screening during the SXSW Film Fest. I waited in line three hours for tickets. Here's the real scoop. The creators of this film are ingenious. The way they organized and promoted this film is something that will be studied for years to come. But the movie itself is an utter disappointment. It is NOT scarier than 'The Exorcist.' It does NOT do for the woods what 'Jaws' did for the water. It's pretty much a theatrical version of MTV's 'The Real World' with a shoddy and slight supernatural spin on it. There were two things that were genuinely frightening about this movie: seeing just how many times the characters could use the word 'f**k,' and the realization that I wasted fifteen bucks and an hour and a half of my life on this movie. It's worth a rental so you can draw your own conclusions, but prepare to be disappointed.
__label__2 This is an excellent product: I have this set up operating off X-10 commands that are generated from my HAI Omni security system. while vacationing on the great lakes I called my security system and had it run irrigation every few days, but not when my Iphone app said it was raining.I can tell you this is a rugged and easy to use device. It has operated flawlessly for 3 years now and is way more flexible then the standard timer based irrigation system. It must be placed outside in an enclosure, and has some nice features like a maximium allowable irrigation time that is a failsafe against runaway irrigation. thumbs up.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: We got this as a gift, and I originally thought the concept was cute, however it is too difficult for my kids to use. I have a 1 year old as well as a 2 year old and they both get frustrated with this toy. When it is in the bicycle position, it is too low to the ground and almost impossible for them to move. The wheels don't turn, they just slide. They only like it when I push them because it is too hard for them to do themselves (but this gets too tiring for me).
__label__1 Inner Journey: A Spirited Conversation About Self-discovery: As I viewed this, I was aware of how wonderful I felt and how great it is to have someone talk about loving yourself and focusing on the real existance (breath): the breath that we take in every day and take for granted. Prem Rawat speaks the truth about the real joy, the joy of living. We so often associate joy to what we achieve, a love relationship and getting what we want. The joy of living is rarely spoken about. He is refreshing, real and allows us to keep it simple and just appreciate life itself. What a breath of fresh air in a world where so much is expected of us and where there is so much pain and suffering.
__label__1 will not fit all: I was hoping it would be soft and fit comfortably as the other hat I bought from Peter Grimm. It did not, so I can not wear it. It is too small and gives me a head ache.The other hat I wore for 6 years and was comfortable from day 1 and up until it wore out.I really hate I can not wear this new hat, seems as though it is made from concrete,
__label__2 Quick, valuable read.: The book reads quickly and easily; but still manages to remain quite informative.The book covers a number of periods in which rampant financial speculation was present. The end lessons: "It's not different this time" and "History is bound to repeat itself"
__label__1 AHHHHHH. Not you Mrs. Michaels!: I am a huge Barbara Michaels fan, yet when I read this book I was higly disappointed.The characters are tranparent and the story line was completely tiresome. I have read mostly all of her novels and I can honstly say this is the worst one she has ever read. If you want to see Barabara Michaels at her peak read SONS OF THE WOLF, VANISH WITH THE ROSE, or STITCHES IN TIME. They will give you insight into the genius of Mrs.Michael's, not this book.
__label__2 Leapster: this is a great system, my grandson loves it and it is durable enough for "the moose" otherwise known as Alex!!
__label__1 doesn't work properly: This product does not work. Well let me restate that; if you do not touch your cell phone after you plug this in it may work for you. Any slight movement to the jack will prevent this adapter from working. I can't say I'm all that upset with this product b/c it cost me less than $5.00. However, after purchasing this adapter jack and discovering it does not work I went to radio shack and bought an $11.00 adapter and it seems to work perfectly. If you're trying to turn your cell phone into an MP3 player this is not the product for you. Spend a little bit more money and get something that works.
__label__1 What were they thinking: To make a good headset isn't that hard. For some reason they just couldn't do it. First off, the mic isn't long enough to reach close to your mouth and the mic sensitive enough to work when its not right in front of your mouth.The second big thing that they messed up is they put the MUTE button in the middle of the cord instead of by the controller. Think about it, your hands are already by the controller, add a mute button where your hands are. It is a such a pain if you have to mute you have to find this switch somewhere half way on your body and look at it to figure out which way to slide it.Don't buy this headset when there are better ones for the same price.
__label__1 Heritage Farm squirrel proof bird feeder: I have used these feeders for the past several years and wanted to add two more. I first went to the Heritage Farms web site and they were priced at $50 so went to Amazon web site and these looked like the same bird feeders for only $37.59. I guess you get what you pay for as these are made in CHINA with cheap metal and the metal hanging bar is not a single piece of steel. It has two hinge joints on the side arms that will wear out I am sure! The real Heritage Farms feeders are made in the USA. I think they should be advertised as made in China.
__label__2 Interesting Ideas: Overall an interesting read. Makes you think out of the box. This book gave me more ideas to make my business grow.
__label__1 Kanal: Kanal fascinates me as one of the best war movies ever made. Each character shares a tragic story of bravery, cowardice, betrayal, and sacrifice. However, this video copy was disappointing. There was hardly any sound, even with the volume at the highest setting. Granted, the movie is in Polish and I had to rely on subtitles, but there is more to communication than just words. I missed the emotion in the voice, and missed the ambiance created by the sound effects. Also the picture quality in the kanals seemed poorer than I had remembered, keeping me in near darkness. Kanal is a great movie, but this video's quality was disappointing.
__label__1 Awful Sound quality: I was so looking forward to watching this... for the Beatles songs and Paul's own. I was very disappointed by the sound quality. Lots of fading and drop outs. Probably caused in part by all the cutting and editing. I too wish it was just music. Please remaster the sound!
__label__2 A Compelling Photo Book: Anyone who ever photographed dark-skinned subjects will admire how good Ken Light handles a camera. As good as the photography is, it is shocking to see this level of poverty in America. But Light's subjects are presented with dignity and beauty. The tension in the subject's inner strength and their awful surroundings is memorable.
__label__2 Better than I expected: I can't really say too much about this album more than it is simply more than I expected. Redman's rhyming, and his use of samples more than makes up for his slightly harsher voice. This is the first Redman album I have purchased and I am pleased with what I heard.
__label__1 Don't Do IT !: I was so excited to receive my "little sewing machine" until I started using it or should I say trying to use it. It was terrible. Very hard to thread and worst of all IT DIDN'T work. It ran for a few stiches and then would ball up on the underside of the fabric with a HUGE knot of thread. Save your money to protct your sanity. Aaaarrrgggg!!!
__label__2 Great heater: Have used one for 2-3 years and it works perfectly. Just ordered another as well. Keep the kid's rooms nice and warm while I cool off the rest of the house at night. Highly recommend.
__label__2 Hot Wheel Movies: I'm not sure what it is about this and other Hotwheels movies but my 30 month old would have each movie running simultaneously, if he had his way! Although there are a few scenes that I feel are scarier than I would prefer my toddler to see, the movie in general, gets a high rating in our household ( 2, 7, and 12 year old boys!). We have all four Hotwheels movies and can't wait for the next!
__label__1 Please enter a title for your review: Every dialogue exchange is slow and tedious. Waiting for a pertinent piece of information to drop is an exercise in patience and endurance. The characters are never established, nor developed enough to even like or dislike them or have much understanding of what motivates anything they do.
__label__2 An opus!: This non-fictional opus relates the story of an eight year legal struggle of a cluster of childhood leukemia victims in a small Massachusetts town and their lawyer against two large industrial companies and, to some extent, the legal system. Harr's first-hand knowledge gives the book and characters a depth rarely seen in non-fiction. His writing draws the reader into the heart of the story; the reader feels he is not merely an observer, but a participant. It is this level of emotional involvement which provides for a fast-paced, consuming read. The book entrances the reader in an epic scale story, both tragic and fascinating
__label__2 unparalleled depiction of garbage and where it goes: This is a non preachy entertaining yet educational book that explains what goes into the garbage and where the garbage goes. De-stigmatizes trash collection. Makes us think about our consumption of goods and keeping a city clean. Our toddler loves yelling, "I stink!" I don't think there's any competitor.
__label__2 A factual, well researched presentation.: The Mormon Issusion gives a detailed account of Joseph Smith's claims and compares them with what the Bible says. The author includes archeological evidence as well as scriptural evidence to make his point. To anyone even casually interested in checking out the truths of Mormonism this book is a must! It is an easy read, and packed with facts that are simple to document. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone searching for real truth.
__label__2 So Awesome!: Our little guy loves the baby papasan...and so does my husband. It plays music and vibrates, but even without those options it is a really neat chair. It has lots of soft textures up against the baby's skin and a wonderfully soft blanket to cover the baby. It's a great purchase! They now have a papasan swing too!
__label__2 Great set: This DVD set is even better than the first one. Christian is outstanding as host. The only thing that could have made it better would have been to have Edge (who's been in a few more ladder matches than Christian) as host.
__label__1 Disappointed: Didn't meet my needs for repeating countdown timer for my exercise program. I spent more than I usually do for an exercise watch and was very disappointed. I replaced it with a less expensive Casio. I was pleased with Amazon's return procedure. I learned to be more penetrating on tech details for future watch purchases.
__label__1 Bogus: A loose account of innuendos woven together haphazardly without illuminating the reader with anything even remotely substantive or factual. To say Milken caused, or had anything to do with the S&L crisis, is not only wrong, it is insulting to anyone who has taken the time to study the events and understand the facts. The author has evidently decided to rely on hearsay evidence to back up pre-assumed (and ultimately false) conclusions.
__label__2 Awesome!: This is the coolest cd I own. I wish that they would continue to make music, but they supposedly broke up-Boo-Hoo! :-( Anyway, I recommend this album to EVERYONE.
__label__2 decent product, good price: This product does exactly what it states: isolates your arm to focus the muscle contraction on your biceps.Its not magical but it is effective... I also found it works great with tricep exercises as well.
__label__1 so much just doesn't apply to me: I tried for a few weeks at the beginning of my pregnancy to fill this out, but it's time consuming and a lot of what it asks doesn't apply to me (as a single mom). I pretty much gave up after less than a month and it's in a drawer somewhere-total waste of money for me. That said....if this is a first child for you and your husband-it'd probably be a great thing to have.
__label__2 Da Bomb!: I was mad at first because something was sticky on my keys on my labtop and I sprayed this air into it and it the keys stuck down...but I walked away for a min to calm down and when I came back the keys where unstuck and they weren't as sticky anymore...yea!!!!
__label__1 terrible: the sound went out in my old headphones so this one looked pretty good. i ordered them and when they arrived i was so disappointed. these headphones are very light but thats because their so cheaply made. it feels like if i sneeze while wearing them they would just rip apart. the wires also feel like that so you gotta be very careful to not tear them up. They are also very short on me so if i put them in my pocket while at the gym they keep on pulling my head down when i walk around.( im 5.9" by the way) i placed an order for a different product and hopefully its more durable then this....
__label__2 The "Bad" Ibsen: A genuinely wonderful comedy, not a bit dated, & a wiser way into Ibsen than any of the later & generally rated greater problem plays. Peer is immensely charming, if reckless & stupid from time to time. He learns, some, with special assistance from Mom & a perhaps incredibly grand sweetheart. Christopher Fry's translation (Oxford) seems particularly nice.
__label__1 Just OK: This had too much about what results you need, but not enough how to get there for me. Not enough concrete steps to take now...
__label__1 Not good for Texas Instrament users: This calculator, although it might allow you to see what you are typing in, it does not allow you to edit anything once you have entered it. This is by far the most terrible thing about this calculator. I would say that if you are not used to using HP calculators, don't get this one. Get the Texas instraments TI-30X-IIS, you will get alot more for your money.
__label__2 J.K. Lasser's Tax Deductions for Your Small Business: I recommend J.K. Lasser's Tax Deductions for Your Small Business because it is easy to navigate - one quick look at the table of contents and you automatically feel comfortable with the simple chapter headings i.e. "Home Office Deductions" "Medical Coverage," and "Car Expenses." Also, the book explains each issue with regard to your type of business format, whether you are a sole proprietor, a partnership or LLC, an S or C corporation. I really appreciated the handy checklist of deductions in the back of the book too.
__label__2 For History Lovers: For those of us who enjoy reading about the days before we were even thought of, this is a great book about out beginnings in England. It is difficult for us to understand the hardships our forbears endured. It is not only well written but Jack Cavanaugh brings us along very well in this series of events.
__label__2 cheap and good: Was very cheap and Seems to work fine.I bought it to use inside of my Korg kaoss pad kp3.
__label__1 Interesting book but not edited correctly: Lots of information. Some quite funny and very useful. Needs to be edited properly with many items from 'Rio for Partiers' accidentally copy and pasted into this book and many page references filled in with 'See page???'. Info on nights out and places to go is also a little out of date with venues and events having changed almost 2 years ago.If you want info on local food and drink or best tourist sites in Salvador then buy this book. If not, then don't bother.
__label__2 Need a summertime diversion?: If you are relaxing this summer and would like a good book to read, then this is the one! Guns, guts, glory, and poetry (?) in the far reaches of the galaxy. Grossman and Frankowski have blended science fiction and warrior combat into a 362 page trip into a future time with current ramifications. Most people in the military or law enforcement will enjoy this book and should be intrigued enough to check out other books by the authors, especially, Dave Grossman's "On Killing" (an texbook truely NEEDED by every law enforcement officer on duty).Keep 'em coming, gents.
__label__1 Yaaaaaaaaaaaaawn: Great reading material.........if you want to go to sleep. Almost makes me think he was a Univ. of Illinois graduate. Probably a rocket scientist. I suggest Mr. Berton leave NASA employment for private industry, civilian rocket ships preferably since that is where the future lies.
__label__1 Little more than an anecdotal story with bad formatting: Others mentioned the links not working, but the entire book is poorly formatted. It does not take much effort to test your book on the Kindle, but it seems that not even an ounce of editing/testing was done.The references are few and far between, and most are anecdotal. Don't waste your time with this book.
__label__1 What a waste of time and money!: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. Go rent it for three bucks, but don't even consider buying this worthless movie. At that you will be wasting 90 minutes of your day watching it and wondering what all the hype is about.
__label__2 Page Turner: I really enjoyed reading Victor's latest novel. I read it in 3 days because I could not put it down. I never knew what was going to happen next. I can't wait for the next one!
__label__1 flawed design: I concur with the reviewer that labeled this saw "junk". After mapping out the room for crown, I proceeded to make my cuts. then came installation. I've hung miles of this stuff, how could I be off so much? Oh well, just go and recut. What is this? When I tighten the table knob the front end rises? My ego felt sooo much better. I've checked many since, I even showed it to a product rep. on a brand new out of the box. She was dismayed and swore to tell the people up the line. Right. But what the hey, it's your money buy one, heck get a couple for the wife and kids. It gets worse the more you use it...
__label__2 Valuable Contributions: This recording represents a valuable contribution to the archiving of Carbon's important works for orchestra (with one chamber work included). All of the performances are outstanding. Especially noteworthy is pianist William Koseluk's interpretation of the Piano Concerto, written especially for him in 1998. Koseluk's introspective romanticism matches the refined beauty of the middle section of the work and his roller-coaster technique gives the more vistuosic sections of the concerto an excitement that makes the entire package three dimensional in a way that most music of today falls short. Also outstanding are the performances of Doris Hall-Gulati (clarinet) and Claire Chan (violin).
__label__1 Good video - but harder than expected: I LOVED the Taebo set of tapes that i bought in the late 90's. The are impossible to find though so i got this. Its a hour long and its hard. Its also very repetitive.whatever happened to the easy Taebo tapes? Is working out only for fit people???
__label__2 Very thought provoking: This is a very thought provoking movie. I was somewhat confused throughout the movie, don't worry, thats part of the fascinating ending! Watch this movie with someone because you will want to discuss your thoughts following it. I highly recommend to anyone who likes movies/books that encourage you to think.
__label__2 ButterBell: Item arrived very quickly and as described. Very happy with it. Would recommend this product to everyone who likes room temp butter thats fresh!
__label__1 Shocking to the reader,: I am a great lover of the words of Heinlein. But this book has got to be one of his worst. While it has some very interesting quantum physics threads, and some interesting character as aware entity moments, it does not hold together. The relationships of the main character and his children (near the end of the book) are confusing and more explicit than needed/wanted. The 'mysteries' the main character was trying to solve fell apart like wet tissue paper. I was dissapointed that the ending did not allow resolution of many issues the book tried to explore. What was heinlein thinking?
__label__2 Love it: I bought this for my little 3 year old nieces who are twins and they love it. When they come over it's the first place they head off to. They stay there for hours playing house and pretend baking. Both of them can fit inside it and I come to visit them too lol.
__label__1 Very Poor Quality: We've only used this a few times and the finish is bubbling and chipping away. One of the four gribs on the bottom came off as well, so it wobbles if we try to use. We've only handwashed.
__label__2 Not Just Good for Actors!: As someone who writes professionally on getting in, moving up, and making it in entertainment and knows how little information has been available for those on the outside striving to break in, I was thrilled to find this book. It contains information specifically written for the aspiring actor but the author takes care to apply that information to screenwriters and other creative aspirants in Hollywood. The tone is friendly and conversational and she shares some good 'stories from the trenches' too.
__label__2 This story is so DIFFERENT!!: As always Iris Johansen comes up with a fascinating and different story line. She has such a great imagination. I love the added character that is always so mysterious and interesting. As in Lord's Bride she has another great character in this one. Keep up the great story lines. I am just starting The Beloved Scoundrel and can't wait to see if she does it again.
__label__2 Insightful, Balanced Analysis of Jefferson's Presidency: McDonald analyzes Jefferson's presidency, discussing the early successes in stopping Federalism, as well as the limitations to the changes that Jefferson and the Republicans could achieve. He discusses the failures of his presidency, notably the embargo of all trade, in a fair manner. Finally, he provides an interesting analysis of the motivations and sources of Republican policy and places Jeffersonianism in its historical context in a much clearer way than I have ever read before.The book is well-written, although perhaps on the short side. It also contains almost nothing about Jefferson's life before or after the presidency--it really is a history of his presidency.
__label__2 Speedy: My first time ordering with Amazon.com. And the DVD I ordered was in great condition and it only took 2 days to be received after it was shipped. Speedy to say the least, since I'm still waiting on another seller DVD.
__label__2 Brilliant Treatise: Stunning epic on borrowing. At times touching, at times playful, always compelling. Author Gross has a remarkable command of language, his prose is enough to bring a grown man to tears. 5 stars. A masterpiece of its time, or of any time.
__label__2 Worth the $$: We bought this last Christmas for our son who was 3 1/2 at the time. Then, he thought it was neat that he could write, then erase want he just wrote & he viewed it as a "big-boy" toy. Shortly after he turned 4 years old is when he picked it back up & really started using it. He is 4 1/2 now & knows the alphabet to letter N, with the help of this toy-- but it's really more than a toy; it's a teacher also. The voice is very clear to understand. My son is rough on his toys & this one still works great after 1 year, so yes, it's durable.
__label__2 Best GYBE! side project yet: owning every gybe! and fly pan am release i needed more and decided to buy this album. Hearing this was a breathe of fresh air. This cd is every bit as good as any gybe! release. This album has great vocals aswell reminiscent of the The's "Burning Blue Soul". The definate highlights of this album are Built then Burnt, Take these hands and throw them in the river, and Triumph of our tired eyes. any fan of gybe! or post rock will fall in love with this cd. sisters, brothers what are you waiting for? BUY NOW!!!
__label__2 Great introduction to Bible stories: "The Beginner's Bible" has been popular for children for many years. With 95 Bible stories written on the level of a child from two to eight years old and colorful cartoon-like illustrations on each page children and parents both delight in this book. The stories are arranged in the same order in which they occur in the Bible which makes it easier to give children a concept of the flow of the Bible.Now Zondervan introduces a companion "Coloring and Fun Activities Book". The activities are related to the Bible stories and help the children to remember the stories. Activites include word searches, mazes, secret codes and matching games. A delightful and fun way to introduce children to Biblical stories and start teaching them about God, it is a highly recommended purchase.
__label__2 great vaccum: my old bissel died after 3 years of use. I liked the looks and features of the Hoover, and it met my price point. I used it after immediately after a run with my bissel, and it continued to pick up pet hair and debri that the bissel just wouldn't get. It is absolutely amazing at getting dog hair out of berber carpet. I am very pleased with the results still after 6 months of use.
__label__2 Dummies guide to Perfect cookin!: You can do alot with this thing and if you use the right amount of water it is perfect every time. All vegetables and meat get done really fast. I Love the auto cut off. Food stays hot for a good while after shut off. Potatoes cook fast if you dice them. Flavoring the water works really well with rice. Rice is perfect and very good but not that fast. I don't mind the 45 minutes for Uncle Ben since it cuts off for you. You can combine things as well and its fun to experiment with flavors together.I give steamers for Wedding presents and they go over really well.
__label__1 Extremely poor design: I have been a fan of hot rollers for decades and these are the worst I have ever owned. The opening down the length of the roller makes it difficult to insert the pins and there is no place to hold the pins. All my sets in the past have had a place to hold the pins. I travel frequently and must find a separate container to hold the pins.I will replace these as soon as possible.
__label__1 Christian assassins gone wild: A not very convincing story line. Acting fair to good. I rented this movie out of curiosity. A group of survivors trying to avoid Christian assassins armed with cross shaped daggers who were slaughtering everyone they can find to save them from the demons which are supposed to take over the world so the slaughtered can go to heaven. Then just before midnight when demons were about to emerge the nut cases gave each other poison pills (they will go to hell if they commit suicide according to the Christian bible). Obviously these people trying to escape the murderers hadn't watched to many horror movies and split up instead of sticking together and got killed one at a time except... I don't want to spoil the ending so go watch it--Its definitely scary. Some scenes were confusing.
__label__1 irritating: Despite the cover, it's basically a single woman singing through most of the CD. Although I much liked some of the other CDs in this series, this is my least favorite. It seemed like she was making up the melodies as she went along, who knows? But even if she wasn't, it came across as grating and pretentious. It's certainly not music you'll be able to have on in the background.Much, much better in the same series was "Les Voix Humaines":Works for Lyra Viol & Bass Viol.
__label__1 Not even a tenth as good as Dracula was: Horrible. Plodding. Poorly written. Verbose. That's the best way to describe this novel. Quite possibly the worst vampire novel I've ever read, and that's taking into account some real clunkers that I've read over the years.The writer should feel ashamed for writing such a poor sequel to possibly the greatest horror and certainly greatest vampire novel of all time.
__label__2 Wonderful Video at a Steal!: Of all the other videos I've bought over the years by Denise Austin or various yoga people, this workout is the best. It's fun and makes the time go by quickly. I enjoy this more than 30 mins. on the NordicTrack. The girls are in great shape (not anorexic-looking) and the drums get you in the island mood. You can pretend you are on vacation in Hawaii learning the Hula! You don't realize how hard you are working until you start sweating - it really is an enjoyable workout without being frenetic. There are some light yoga moves incorporated, but not annoyingly so. You also use your arms a lot, which adds to the benefits. I'm going to buy more of Kili's videos after mastering this one. I FINALLY found an exercise video I will actually use!
__label__1 Did not work at all: I had the unfortunate experience of having my apartment infested with fleas. It was the worst. I bought this in the hopes of some relief, but it did nothing. It managed to catch a fly and a spider, but no fleas. Would not recommend this to anyone.
__label__1 Not quite what I expected: Drawing are good. But, I'm not really a fan of nude fantasy creatures having sex in black and white. I am more into human heterosexual sex in colored glossy paper.
__label__2 Great Research: Read the book. I'm sick and tired of writing reviews and having Amazon knock me off for no good reason (my reviews are never lengthy). This is a scholarly work and not for everyone. If you want to push back the walls of ignorance, read it. If you want to be amused, buy a different book. I apologize for the short and snippy nature of this review.
__label__1 If you seek the real truth....: I have no doubt that the author is well-intended. Unfortunately, like all books that claim there will be "an end of this world" and a "second coming of Christ," this is based on misinterpretation and misunderstanding of Scriptures. If you seek the real truth, keep looking. The sooner we all recognize the truth, the sooner God's New Kingdom will be established on the earth, which shall last forever, never to be destroyed. That's what real prophecy foretells.
__label__1 Lies and Half Truths: Gary Parker has no credibility. He tried to use the Egyptian Plover to disprove evolution. This is a 2500 year old myth that has never been authenticated. Quote mining seems to be another favourite of this author. The book has absolutely no scientific merit. The only thing this book was good for was seeing how weak and diluted the ID/creationist arguments really are.
__label__2 Battle of Hastings: This book is very helpful for anyone interested in this very significant event in the history of England. The author is a superb authority of this period of time.
__label__2 Mom in Ohio: I bought these for my son for Christmas. Looks like a great package deal for a great price and lots of fun for my son.
__label__1 Why would anybody buy this?: OK, this may seem like a fun toy for your kids, but 17 mph? And $400??? I paid $175 for my dirt bike (1979 Yamaha GTMX) and I can go really fast, jump, ride trails, burnouts, and all the things kids want to do. Don't waste your time or money buying an electric dirt bike, gas has so much more power, and if you think your kid can't handle it, they can. Go on craigslist and get them a used 50cc dirt bike, they have speed limiters on some, they will have way more fun, and its cheaper if you find the right one, plus they won't break every 5 seconds, and to all you over protective moms, save time, money, and make your kid happy by getting a real dirt bike, heck even a goped is better (again, used off craigslist) I used my friends when I was like 12 and had fun for about 5 minutes then wanted it to be faster, please people just don't buy this
__label__2 Pictures are very good, information too.: Well I consider that this is a very well illustrated book as well as all those from Audubon Society, pictures are impressive.The information on the book is very useful, it is also very detalailed for a pocket guide, and I consider a good aspect the way to find clouds, is quick and you will easily learn to classify them.
__label__2 Interesting: Is this all-time classic, impeccable rhymes? Is this the best album ever recorded? Of course not. But, with Kanye West's "College Dropout," it is the latest in a gradual shift of hip-hop culture to a more positive, mature, substantial set of values. This is exciting, to see rap shifting from the iced-out thuggery of today (personified in the G-Unit) to an intelligent form of art. And on top of it, it's a pretty good album. No matter what you say about Puffy, he's a good producer, and it shows here. Some notable tracks are "Welcome Back," "Wasting my Time," and "Do You Remember." Positive and fun without being overly pop. In twenty years, we may point to 2004 as the year rap changed, and this album is certainly a part of it.
__label__2 Fantastic !: This is the best Shostakovich Violin Concerto #1 I have heard. It is taken a little slower than most but there is such depth of feeling and intensity that she surpasses all the competition. Other versions I have heard (including the recent Chang) tend to not get beneath the surface. I beleive Josefowicz really understands the tragedy of this music. She has a very interesting interview about herself and this recording in the July issue of Grampohone. It makes for interesting reading.
__label__2 Great For Everyone: This book is exciting to read if you're interested in time travel, regardless of how much math you understand. It gives a good balance between the mathematics of time travel, and concepts, such as paradoxes and multiple universes. I loved it even though I didn't understand most of the math.
__label__2 Puzzle from AMAZON: This book is amazing. Anyone that loves puzzles or Sudoku, this is the book for you. It is challenging and a lot of fun.
__label__2 great book: this book is the comp of the douglas adams series hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. it is hilarious well written and something just to put your imagination to work.
__label__2 Wow! R. Crumb sure evokes memories of a bygone era....: I've been a fan of R. Crumb for almost 50 years(yikes!) and still enjoy all theotherworldly art and ideas from so long ago. What were once cheap comic booksare now high priced collector items, but this paperback is chock full of all the stuffthat made us all laugh during the youthful experimentation phase of our lives.Buy it and spend some time quietly savoring the outrageous art and humor ofone of America's most underappreciated counterculture figures! Cheap thrills!!!
__label__2 Family Strength Under Tragic Conditions: This is a beautifully written family memoir which will educate readers about the history of China since the 1920's through the eyes of three women who lived it.We hear of the "Cultural Revolution" and Chairman Mao in passing, but there's very little understanding of how it really played out for those living there. It's sad, and at times I was angry about what happened in China, but in the end I realized the beauty & strength of Family.
__label__2 A dark jewel of a book; tales that need to be told.: This book tells stories that need to be told; dark, complex, true stories that are as familiar as fantastical. I cried when I read this book. That never happens to me. These are the fairy tales I needed to hear, and I didn't know that I needed to hear them until I heard them and was in tears. Beautiful and profoundly moving. I've already given away five copies.
__label__1 Desktop charger--NOT!: I bought the desktop charger along with the 2-way radios--it never charged properly--either didn't charge the batteries or overcharged--I finally just went out and bought some rechargable batteries, and a charger at my local drug store--much less hassle overall--
__label__1 Just a very bad movie: I don't get it. Do not know what the hype is all about. This movie sucked. This movie once again proves that the critics don't have a clue, the Oscars are meaningless, and people will buy into anything.It is two hours I wish I could get back.
__label__1 Do not buy this printer: I bought this printer for my 85-yr-old mother to use with her iMac (OS 9.2). From the outset, there were problems. The drivers provided on the CD did not load properly, and the printer has never printed the way it should. I had to download drivers from the Canon website, which did not work either. Getting support from Canon was close to impossible and we are now going to junk a printer that ultimately printed a grand total of no more than 100 pages in its short demented life. I am not a helpless computer user, but I have never encountered so many problems with a printer. Maybe ours was a lemon, but I would not recommend this printer.
__label__2 Funny Movie!!: This is a very funny movie. Rick Moranis is a great actor and is very funny in this movie. This is one of my favorite movies.
__label__1 Nowhere near as good as Ziggy: This album is overrated, literally. The fact that this album has higher marks then Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars is crazy. It is nowhere as good, not even close.It's not for casual fans, its got some good tracks, but it's really arty and doesn't have a lot of jamming or rock. It's more of a serious fan album, but not a completist album, it's better then that.Basically skip this one unless you love Bowie. Start with Ziggy, Aladdin, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station To Station, Scary Monsters, or Let's Dance, there are just so many Bowie Albums better then this one.
__label__2 Final Cut: The best album Pink Floyd ever released. Yes, better than The Wall or Darkside, get off the bandwagon.They are great albums but not better than Final Cut.
__label__1 a disappointed kansan: I've just read Janice Graham's "Sarah's Window," which I find to be a disappointing portrait of the Flint Hills, where I happen to live. I'm familiar with many of the places mentioned in the book -- I've visited the house where Susan and John supposedly live and I've eaten at the Cassoday Cafe. Graham is inconsistent in her depiction of the people of the Flint Hills. When we first meet Billy, for example, he speaks like a cowpoke; within two pages, his vocabulary has shifted to that of an intellectual. You'll find both types in the Flint Hills, but you likely won't find such drastic shifts in the same person. I know a university professor who's an expert on Flint Hills cowboy folklore, but his vocabulary and demeanor are consistent, unless he's in character to tell a story. For those of us who know the places -- and some of the people -- Graham is presenting, I think she's done a disservice to her readers who think she has captured this unique part of the world.
__label__1 not satisfied: I bought 3 flash lights from you guys. one worked the second one had a small glow the third did not work at all.I did not open the packages because I was not home when they came so i dont know who each one was from but you need to police the people who you sell for. I DONT THINK I WILL EVER BUY FROM YOU AGAIN!
__label__1 Amazing book, horrible small format in this edition: Elsa Beskow's "Peter In Blueberry Land" is one of our favorite children's books. The illustrations are lovely and the story delights a wide range of ages. The only problem is that this particular format (a hardcover book measuring 6.7" wide x 5.2" tall) does not do justice to such a treasure. The pictures are not as enjoyable and, in many cases, the publishers of this edition have chosen to place text on top of the illustrations. It is definitely worthwhile seeking out the larger format hardcover book (12.5" wide x 9.5" tall) as you will want to keep it for future generations. It would be better, in my opinion, to buy a good second hand copy of the larger book than a new smaller version.
__label__1 Garbage: Jon ought to stick to his "schtick" of trying to make a living being a comic. Typical liberal garbage, only not funny.
__label__2 Freedom Writers DVD: This DVD was purchased as a Christmas gift. My husband really enjoys this movie. The DVD had good quality sound and picture.
__label__1 Too long: A good documentary on Diana's life would have served better. Going back and forth from concert to clips was too much and made the film longer than it should have been.
__label__1 Garbage-very slow in accepting keystrokes: DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.I am not a very fast typer but this calculator is too slow and does not accept the keystrokes if not enough time is given in-between the key strokes.Hence I almost always mess up the calculation.
__label__1 My Lord...isn't Usher ever gonna shut up?: I dream of a day when rap will be abolished. I also dream of a day when Usher will be forgotten. But I guess that will never happen. Usher is so annoying...I hate Yeah and am getting quite tired of it myself. And Usher is not a poet. Bob Dylan is a poet, but he doesn't like the word. Paul McCartney is a poet. John Lennon was a poet...Rest in peace, man. Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson are/were poets. James Brown, to a certain extent, is a poet. Usher is doomed to fade away. In fifty years, who do you think will be remembered? The Beatles, or Usher? I'll give you a hint--35 years after their breakup, and 25 years after Lennon's all-too-early demise, the Beatles still have a large teen following (myself included). So forget Usher. If you want to hear a good soul singer, James Brown, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder all qualify. Usher simply doesn't.
__label__1 worst book: This is the worst book I ever tried to read! I just don't get it. Maybe it is a sign of my literary ignorance. I tried to read , but it was too painful to endure. For me, the book had no redeeming qualities - not the characters, the plot (or lack thereof), or the writing style. A complete waste of time.
__label__2 be sure to warm the pot: before use...it keeps the coffe hotter...very nice to look at..i don't mind leaving it on the counter.
__label__1 Poor quality loppers: I ordered these loppers for my son to use while I use the one I bought 15 years ago. This lopper has very thin metal at the cutters. It is three times thiner than mine. On small branches the blade bends and does not fully cut the branch sometimes. This lopper will not last long with heavy use.
__label__1 Not what I expected: This video highlights the year but not very well and don't expect to see the final game. In fact the final game barely shows for more than a few seconds. It is hard to follow at times, they don't label but the most important games. The video jumps around a lot too. Not worth it unless you just have to have all things Kentucky. Sorry I wasted my money.
__label__1 Not as great as i imagined...: the only reason i gave it two starts is because a flexi light should be able to hold all positions but because the light is top heavy it unbends in certain positions but it was cheap so i guess no harm done. just an fyi its common sense if you make things top heavy, they will topple.
__label__2 Very Nice: Product came exactly as described. My three year old daughter loves the set. Made it an easy transition to a "big girl" bed.
__label__2 The 1950 Mercury is the Real Star: I find this movie very entertaining and I enjoy watching it about once a year. But I wouldn't bother to watch it except for the chopped top 50 Merc that Stallone drives....
__label__1 Good Introduction, Not For Fans: If you are already a fan of King Crimson, apart from a few live tracks you have probably heard everything that's on here. This is a great way to hear a lot of the classic songs in a really well-mastered format though. In fact, it's a charming little collection for the most part, but it does something I never thought a King Crimson collection would do: edit and abridge the songs!Classics such as Starless, Islands, Exiles and Moonchild have all been cut down! All of my favorite songs are cut down to radio singles; this makes the collection hard to listen to. It might not bother a new fan though, as they don't know what the songs should sound like. Also most of the Lizard album got shafted, kind of lame.This is an ok item for beginners, but as a starting point I would probably recommend getting the 'Young Person's Guide to King Crimson' or the 4-cd live box 'The Great Deceiver' instead.
__label__1 Meh...: You can find a lot better and more up to date info on the web. Not particularly useful or informative, though there's a few nice pics. Check out The Complete Ball Python by Kevin McCurley for a real ball python book.
__label__2 Sneaky Lexmark.: This has nothing to do with the seller but mainly with Lexmark. I purchased this machine to replace and old Lexmark Wireless All- in-one photo. (The sane exact model). The reason why is I had and have replacement ink for what was mine and this machine takes altogether different cartridges so instead of saving money to use my ink, I got nowhere. I could have purchase my model of choice- a stylus and/or laser, Now, I have to worry when the piece of roller will break off again and stuck with unused ink. Big Businesses.Oh well,Rose
__label__1 Don't buy this unless it "speaks" to you!: Just from browsing the excerpts i can tell this book isn't for me. Anything that reads like a Trigonometry Text is better left to a person better than I.
__label__2 Good, but not the best Bond movie.: This movie was very good in many ways. There was a great variety of gadgets, weapons, and villains. The car scene was also excellent. Although this Bond may have been good, it just doesn't seem to hit the spot. The Bond Girls weren't so great and the villain was very so-so. The plot was up to speed with the franchise and it is chocked full of Bond goodness, but something just struck me as awkward about this installment that I can't quite put my finger on. Nevertheless, the movie is good, and so is the DVD. Great picture and sound on this DVD with some very enticing Special Features. This movie is ideal for the Bond fan, but if you're looking for an introduction to the series or maybe to the new 90's Bonds, I suggest Goldeneye.
__label__1 The Big Man & His Shadow: Account of how the fearless leader hoodwinks yet another pidgeon. Too bad Toomer & the rest of them couldn't honor & respect those who truly deserved it...their wives & mothers.
__label__1 Problems: The blender would be great if not for the many issues.LCD screen does not turn on the 1st time. I had the blender replaced, and the second one had the same issue. Also, the cog that sticks out of the base broke free from the base. I was only chopping ice. Not a good product.
__label__1 puhleese: This woman would be pitiful if she were not so apallingly arrogant. She is genuinely sick; however, one cannot feel sorry for her in the face of her meanspirited remarks. She has had every advantage, yet she obviously learned nothing at Harvard. She boasts that she is the leading non-fiction writer of her generation and that she is the 'prettiest girl she knows." This is good because no one else thinks so. She may have a ph.d. in the reader's digest or in junk food, but she certainly is not worldly, knowledgeable or scholarly. I haven't read one good review of any of her books. How in heaven's name could this sloppy work have been published? The publishers were evidently high as well. I feel sorry for the poor trees that sacrificed their lives for the paper.
__label__2 emotional experience: This is one of the most important books of my life! My roommate was Martha - a central character -I was working for UNDP in Indonesia during the period. I so love you Martha and also Daniel for writing this book! It helped me through alot... I am grateful that the outcomes of this event turned out good for you two (at least).
__label__2 KitchenAid food processor 12 cup: Have only used the food processor a couple of times so far. We had several previous to the KFP750WH and none perform as well as this product.
__label__1 IT SUCKED!!!!: Once again, an inexplicable parade of glowing reviews for an unfunny movie. You all remember The Last Shot when it was in the theaters, right? The $30 million opening weekend, the $200 million total gross? No? Good, because this movie, if it ever made it to theaters, lasted about two seconds. I can't imagine how anyone could think a movie with the star power of Matthew Broderick and Alec Baldwin, but which no one saw in a theater, could be any good. It's not. This movie was buried for a reason: it's boring. Broderick is his usual cloying self and Calista Flockhart appears as his whacky girlfriend who hates dogs, which is a running "joke" in the movie. The script strains for laughs which are not there.
__label__1 Messy! Messy!: I've never had to clean a coffee maker so much. My previous grinder/brew machine was from Melitta, which never required this much cleaning. The Cuisinart leaves a mud puddle in the grinder area after every use, creating sludge that is hard to clean off. The mud puddles under the grinder basket, up inside of it and it is difficult to clean and dry this area. The water chamber is awkward and there are just too many parts. Yes, once cleaned it works nicely, but it is a royal pain in the behind. I think I might just go back to a Melitta.
__label__2 New Ideas to Jump Start your Practice: This is a wonderful book. I've been in practice for 30+ years. While I have used most of the approaches for a long time, this book has put togetherstrands from many areas of knowledge and practice. It integrates theory and practice, relates directly to therapists' issues, provides usefulcase examples, AND is a fascinating read. Well worth the cost and the 400 page read. I am amazed at how much clarity and progress it hasbrought to my practice.
__label__2 Light and convenient to use: First, I should tell you that I live in a one bedroom apartment, and while I have a dog the vacuum doesn't have to do real hard duty. The two downsides to this vacuum are its dirt container, mentioned elsewhere, which is impossible to empty cleanly (but I suspect this would be true for any bagless vacuum, to a certain extent) and the fact that the hose attachment and tools are rather short if you need to do really high jobs.On the flip side, this is among the lightest of all bagless upright vacuums, and it moves effortlessly. It weighs at least 10lbs less than the other models I looked at. Further, the rather standard 12 amp motor does an exceptional job of getting ALL dirt. Add this to a reasonable price, and this is a winner!
__label__1 Not one that sent me reeling...: Having read the above reviews, I was expecting to be knocked out by this album; instead it landed me a kid-gloves tap on the jaw. The lack of drums is not compensated for by the effete percussion work, and, oh, how the dexterity and edification of Bruninghaus's piano work are missed! The vocals, too, lend the tracks a lightweight and pop-like feel.Prior to purchasing Fluid Rustle, I had spent three weeks being propelled through the nuanced musical wonderland that is Silent Feet, so perhaps my disappointment was inevitable. Weber is undoutedly a modern-jazz heavyweight, and much of his work is spellbinding, but this particular effort doesn't pack too great a punch.
__label__2 The best of the best!: I absolutly love to play Halo! It's very fun in single player mode, and even better in multiplayer co-operative mode! It's kinda like a 007 game, but on an alien planet with other team members in your group! It is an excelent buy for those who want a good shootem' up game!
__label__1 Boring as boring can be: Ugh. Don't waste your time. You may think this is a "movie", but it's just something Showtime threw together. None of the acting is very good, and it has very little, if any, redeeming qualities.I know, I know, it has "Sinatra" in the title, how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me.The only thing I liked about it, assuming they stuck to facts, is that you learn what happened to Frank Jr's captors.
__label__2 Beautiful: Perhaps because I am newly divorced, i loved this story. I wished Hunter could have lived a little longer ultimately. Quaye reminded me of women who just keep taking and feeling that perhaps this is their lot. I was glad that Hunter let her know that she is entitled to love. The way he said it was beautiful. What a beautiful love story.
__label__2 A book I have been trying to relocate for years!: As a young girl, I borrowed this book from my father's paperback collection. With time, it disappeared from my life, and I have missed it. Every so often, I have tried to re-locate it, and imagine my joy at finding it again.What can you say about a book that has haunted you for over 45 years? It is great. An entertaining and enjoyable combination of spy and sci fi.Our hero is given the task of being a small but annoying nuisance on a planet behind enemy lines. Theory being that a wasp in a car of grown men can wreak havoc beyond his size.His ability to morph from one shape and identity to another is a lot of fun.
__label__2 One of the Best of 2002: While I didn't like this CD quite as much as their previous, slightly mellower release "This Desert Life", this is still a great CD. The album's title track is one of the catchiest songs of 2002, and the Ryan Adams collaboration "Butterfly in Reverse" is lyrically beautiful and musically elegant.
__label__2 Absolutely fascinating: This is a book that I read very quickly as almost every chapter asked interesting questions. The most controversial connection is between abortion and the drop in crime rates. The access to the financials and principal cast of a drug dealing operation was profoundly fascinating.The questions asked are fearless and provocative and use basic economic incentive theory to explain connections.It was engrossing and intelligent.Several people,in their reviews, point out that there is little description of methodology and no comprehensive presentation of detailed results. We are asked to assume that rigorous statistical analysis has been done and that the conclusions are based on sound practices and methods. This is a fair criticism and people looking to pore over the results with a critical eye will be disappointed.The lack of statistical detail, while a little annoying, did not really affect my enjoyment of the book.I highly recommend it.
__label__2 Weird and Wonderful!: This is a great book. The author has a great sense of humour and a wonderful imagination. If you have a skewed sense of the odd and bizarre, then this book is for you. The patterns/directions are quite simple to follow and the results are hysterical fun!
__label__2 Wendy Knows Her Stuff...Wonderful Concept and Execution: This is a truly great book; much better than other books I've read on Illustrator alone. The fact that it covers Photoshop (and Painter) as well is a bonus.
__label__1 The Author based his book on a Hoax: The "Priory of Sion", which was central to the authors' hypothesis in Holy Blood Holy Grail, never actually existed as described. Far from having a "history (that) spanned more than a millennium," the Priory was a hoax created by a pretender to the throne of France, Pierre Plantard, a convicted con-man, in 1953. As part of his hoax, Plantard had planted numerous bogus documents in the French National Library, as well as in the 1967 book Le Trésor Maudit de Rennes-le-Chateau. (For more details, see The Priory of Sion, Rennes-le-Chateau, and Pierre Plantard). The authors' hypothesis in The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail was significantly premised on the veracity of these documents. As a result, the revelation that the Priory documents were indeed fabricated serves to detract from much of the book's impact and plausibility.
__label__1 A really bad mix of a really good song: This CD is a really bad remix or a really good song. I don't know how this group got there music on a Label, but they did. My only recomendation is get the original song, and stay awya from this remix.....it was so bad, it left me bitter.
__label__1 huh?: Is this the same Meshuggah? What happened t the mindblowing Polyrythems? the structures? all the kickass timing? and the strong vocals? Jens Kidman is horrible on this album. The only awesome, most kickass thing ever is the inclusion of the None ep. Which you can't find anywhere. The none ep gets a 5. Contradictions collapse gets a 0. overall 1.
__label__1 Enamel cast iron pan with enamel falling off: This is a large and heavy cast iron pan with enamel coating, red on the outside and white on the inside, made in China. After the first use, it was put into hot water for cleaning, and a large piece of enamel came off the inside bottom.The seller has provided a free return shipping label and promised a full refund.
__label__2 The best toy my newborn received!: From the time he was one week old, this toy has kept my little boy happy! He loves looking at the moving fish and the light. He's not all that interested in the music, but loves the bubble sounds it makes and can just stare at it forever! It has come in handy endless times when I want to take a shower or get some housework done. My god-daughter calls it "Fishy TV". The only things I don't like is that it only stays on for a short time and until they are bigger, babies can't turn it back on. Once they learn, it's no problem. Also, it was a little hard to attach to our crib, but we figured out a way. Overall, it's a great product and I would recommend it to any new mom or as a gift for a baby shower!
__label__2 Interesting: One of the most interesting books on fashion I have ever read. Marketing, sales and business aspects on how the brand expanded in Japan told by an insider. Read it!
__label__2 Henkel review: Like the shape and strength of the fork tines, the edge of the knife could of been keener. Over all he is satisfied with the product. I purchased this for my husband for a Christmas present. He had been looking for set like this for years. Thank you for the superior quality of the product.
__label__1 The Pen Can Be Very Poisonous!: The only reason I can think of for reading this trash is to see how facts can be twisted and distorted to suit the view of the author and said author's personal prejudices.Beware! The pen can be more poisonous that the cobra!
__label__2 A Person of Interest: I purchased this book to encourage my middle/high school special education students to read. I must admit that when I first added the book to the classroom library all the students did was look at the pictures, but eventually they began reading and became hooked. The best way to get reluctant readers to read is to find a book that interests them. This book really caught on!
__label__1 This phone is the worst: Yeah, I mean it. This phone is the worst in reception and battery life, two most important areas one would look for in a good phone.I have been using this for a while now (more than a year) and I have at least one dropped call in a day. I make hardly 10 to 15 calls a day and one out of 10 is not 3%, you moron (I am addressing the customer service rep here who told me 3 to 5% of dropped calls is quite normal).The best place for this phone is the gutters, not your pocket.
__label__2 Very Pleasing: This is a pretty good christmas CD. Soothing and blissful and he's cute too.I'm gay. And so are the holidays. MERRY CHRISTMAS
__label__2 Enough Drama For Your Mama,LOL: This was a Drama fast paced read once it got going. The first few chapters went a little slow for me but after chapter three this book took off and I had to put on my seatbelt. At times I laughed and at one point I even cried. This was well worth my dime. It had drama but also a positive message involved.
__label__1 great for moms: My mother asked me to purchase this for her and she loves it. It reminds her of being a kid in the fifties. However, be forewarned that played over and over it can be truly annoying.
__label__2 Fantastic Book: Probably one of the best golf books ever. The pictures of the some of the courses are just amazing. Flicking through the pages makes you want to go and play golf straight away. A superb book!
__label__1 2 For Who?: The much anticipated follow up to their self-titled debut is a waste of time. I was highly dissapointed. I was expecting a slight advancement on their previous work, yet keeping with their style. The first single alone turned me off. Who's heard of Techno-Acoustic? The mix just doesn't work. If you like techno, buy Moby. If you like rock, buy Alice In Chains. If you like Days Of The New, buy their first album. By all means, don't buy 2.
__label__1 Major Call was my grandfather...: Major Call was my grandfather. I never knew him and know very little about him due to the fact that no one in my family has ever been willing to speak of him. I tried to read this book objectively. I was aware of the fact that my grandfather was a murderer growing up so it wouldn't have been difficult for me to accept the premise of this book.However, I don't think there is any solid evidence to implicate my grandfather in this case. I also think the book is poorly written (the made-up conversations are overly dramatic, the scant evidence poorly presented) and I think the author is basically trying to use lightning to illuminate a match, as it were.
__label__1 Modern Day Slavery: I do not understand how this game lets you edit a person but you cannot change the skin tone of your character. You can have fairytale elephant feet and ridiculous antler horns but you can ony play as a caucasion person. It is the 21st century and this game still has not gotten with the program.At first I shrugged it off unitl I started noticing the ring leader was always white and the carni who had to work the booths was black; in every game though. the only black people in the games are carni rode people. So they did have the technology to create people of color but chose to only feature them as modern day slaves!!!If I had not bought this racist game used from Game stop I would have taken it back the same day.
__label__1 CORRUPT DATA: When I tried to put music on my PSP maybe 10 or so got by the corrupt data, so out of 4GB only a few MB actually didn't get corrupted, a sad sad day indeed. pass it up and get a sandisk, your data will thank you later.
__label__1 If you're not a fan, save your money.: I had never seen the X-Files on TV when I saw the movie. However, I watched with an open mind and high hopes. Unfortunately, the byzantine plot is impossible to get a handle on. Call me a whiner, but I have a thing for movies that actually end with some kind of plot resolution, instead of just arbitrarily stopping. Seeing this muddled combination of nasty aliens and conspiracy theories just reminded me how much better "Independence Day" was at the former and "Enemy of the State" at the latter.
__label__2 Got it for my girlfriend: My girlfriend was looking for it because she loves this kind of music.I surprised her with this compact disc when i went to her house one night.
__label__2 Condition as described: Book arrived quickly and as described. This was a book for a summer reading project and did not need to be in perfect condition so saved money by buying used! Would buy again!
__label__1 Not Playable in Region 1?: What do you mean?U.S. customers can buy it but not watch it?What's up with that?All I can say is: "I HATE NBC!"The show is 5 STARS, but "may not be playable in Region 1 DVD plays" brings it down to a 1.(Love the show, Hate NBC)
__label__1 Poor QA: First set I got only 1 worked. Returned those for replacement set and both were defective. The one that did work sounded good though. The price is right if you can get a good pair. Returned them for the Kenwoods which work and sound great.
__label__1 fun, for a week tops: i got this game for my birthday some time ago. at first i was amazed at how fun this game was. I don't play video games much so i played it on and off for about a week or so, After that week i turned the game on and played it. I passed world one and then I was shocked, what happened? the little monsters are just annoying, The spiked one was the one that drove me insane, I jumped clear over it and the game ended, I was sent back at least three stages. here are some things that annoy me* the graphics are not-so-great.* it just does downhill after the first world* bowser is too easy to beat in the first world large castle (you just jump over him)* How everytime you loose all your lives you loose your progress. (i was on world eight the big castle and lost all my progress and was sent back to the little castle)i don't get why this game is so horrible. The wii version is so much betterSPENT FIFTEEN DOLLARS MORE FOR THE WII VERSION ITS BETTER!!!!!
__label__1 Worked for awhile: Was very happy with this trash can when I first purchased it. But, it's now been 8 months and I just discovered that the latch for the battery cover is broken off. This causes the batteries to sag and then the lid opens and closes continually without stopping.Customer service for iTouchless was less than helpful, just telling me that this isn't covered until the year warranty and good luck. A replacement lid is $40.I'm very disappointed. Now I have a trash can without a lid.
__label__2 Shorter pumice piece would work better & not break, use precautions, and be careful not to scratch/damage the porcelain bowl.: I agree. This pumice stone works pretty well, much better than chemicals and toilet brushes. HOWEVER..... First, wear latex or rubber gloves when you work in a toilet bowl, and add some bleach (it doesn't take very much to sanitize the toilet bowl water). I drained the toilet bowl water by turning the valve off, flushed, then poured my bucket of detergent in water into the bowl. My "pumice stick" broke in two when I first started using it. I believe it's too long to be totally useful. I used the broken 1/2 and was able to scrub the rings. I also used liquid Spic & Span in water, with some bleach, to help the cleaning. I do think you can find cheaper pumice stones, smaller, shorter, that might even work better. Be careful with how hard you scrub, as well. This is a very abrasive stone, no need to scratch/damage the porcelain bowl any more than necessary.
__label__1 WONDERFUL PACKAGE - TERRIBLE PICTURE QUALITY: This is a wonderful season of Buffy. And the DVD boxed set is an amaxing representaion of that. Superb packaging, great special effects, and cool menus. However, the DVD picture quality on most of the episodes is down right nasty. Some of them, like "Inca Mummy Girl" are so grainy and dark you have to laugh. Random "night" scenes are so dark that most of the features in Buffy 's face dissapear. I own some of these same episodes from the VHS release - and the picture quality is TONS better. I have no idea what happened in the transfer. Somebody please fix this for future releases. What's the fun of Angelus when the scenes are so dark and grainy you can't even see the sheen from his leather pants!?
__label__1 bland: If you like the emotion and urgency of davey havoks usual vocals, then you'll be dissappointed with this release. i love davey and jade(seriously, they have restraining orders), but this disc seemed uninspired. it's like dance music you sit down to listen to. i cant wait for the next AFI release.
__label__1 Glitchasaurus: LED screen: half the characters are faded and unreadableParallel port: puh-leese. I had to reconfigure my CMOS (that was scary) and mess around with basic operating system issues before it would work. Then had to pull CPU out, disconnect printer to use port. What a pain.Software did not work. One of the reasons I spent a lot of time with windows systems settings and looking for online hints was the recurring message that my computer could not find the device when I tried to initialize the internal memory (per the instructions). For grins, I tried to download without this step and low-and-behold the transfer worked. Could have saved myself a couple of hours--ARGH!!!!Bottom line: unpleasant experience.
__label__2 Understanding Einstein: This is a great read - easy and pleasant. It won't leave you going to sleep struggling with making sense of the laws of physics when racing along side a light beam in a train but it does give a colorful and insightful view of what was probably the greatest mind of the twentieth century. You will gain a better understand the workings of Einstein and the relationships and conflicts in his professional life. If you've wondered about his accomplishments and why so many recognized his achievements as outstanding, this book will put it all in perspective.
__label__1 Review of "Minding the Monsters": I chose this item because I have seen other dvds of Jeff Dunham's which were very funny. This one wasn't very funny. He kept making obtuseremarks about his recent divorce. It was really boring. I took it on vacation to share with several members of the family. No one liked it.I would not recommend it.
__label__1 It kind of works. I guess.: Bought this after an extraordinarily bad suggestion to try Lectric. Some pros and cons:Pros:-Much cleaner than Lectric.-Sort of worked. A little.-Smells fine.Cons:-Sort of didn't work. A lot.-Drew bloodAfta seemed to help a little bit in some of the areas that really didn't need much help in the first place, but problem areas like under the chin and near the Adam's Apple were still left with a significant amount of hair. And for the first time ever, my electric razor actually drew blood - twice. Never happened with Lectric, or sans-treatment entirely. I really wish I could return this to the store, as I don't have any use at all for the rest of the bottle. I'm giving up and going back to razors.
__label__2 This book is worth more than it's weight in your suitcase!: Plotkin's Italy for the Gourmet Traveler was like a Bible of Italy to us. As we drove throughout Italy, not only did we learn the most interesting history of each region from this book, we learned exactly where to shop for our gourmet picnic, where to taste the best gelatie, as well as which bar, bakery, trattoria, osteria or restaurant to dine according to our mood and pocketbook. We weren't once dissapointed. I can't wait to try out each of his regional recipes throughout the book. If you're a "foodie" like us, don't experience Italy without this book. Fred Plotkin is a master of Italian dining!
__label__2 Do not hesitate to buy this item!: I work in video with a relatively small camera, the Canon GL2. It is a great little camera with amazing images, but it's size deters it from being truly wobble-free. With this Sima Video Bracket, I can now capture live events without looking as if I spent all my time at the bar. The bracket allows my images to be virtual shake free, and I can't believe it took me so long to discover this item.The only downside regarding use on such a camera as the GL2, is that it interferes just barely with the LCD monitor. So rather than have the LCD screen open all the way, it is now open almost all the way, which for me is no problem, as I can still see it just fine, but for others that may not be to their liking. Smaller cameras may not have this issue.In all, I am very satisfied with this product, I would have easily paid $25 for this item that I purchased for $15.
__label__1 Only for the "good wife": I am sure there are women who will appreciate this book but it just wasn't for me. I found it difficult to swallow some of the advice such as, if you have stopped cooking dinner for your husband then get back in the kitchen. I think you have to be in the right mindset for this book as it is entirely focused on what you need to do differently as the wife. For me it was difficult to get through everything I need to do without asking my husband to take any action steps. Hopefully there are wives out there that can appreciate this book more than I have.
__label__1 Beware of Quality Control Problems: One would think: a sturdy weight bench, manufactured by a well-known and respected company. A simple piece of equipment with simple assembly -- that is, assuming the parts fit together. The bench I ordered was defective. The front bracket was far too narrow and misshapen to accept the front stabilizer bar. The heavy steel bracket displayed no damage or paint chipping, suggesting that the problem occurred at the point of manufacture. And it's not an easy fix. This is clearly a quality control problem -- since one finds so few separate parts to be checked for quality. Buyer beware.
__label__2 Excellent, but....: I agree with the other reviewer concerning the merits of pianist Melvyn Tan performing the complete Beethoven piano concerti accompanied by Sir Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players. My only reservation is that his fortepiano is overwhelmed by the orchestral accompaniment most of the time. It just seems jarring to hear tinkling notes emitting from Tan's fortepiano only to be answered with gale-force volume blasting from the orchestra in return. Perhaps if smaller orchestral forces had been used along with some restraint, or better miking of the soloist, I would have awarded this set 5 stars. Still, since fortepiano renditions of these masterworks are rare, this is a valuable and worthy edition to any music library.
__label__1 TO ME, NOT WORTH THE INCREASED COST: This DVD player is fine, but I do not see much difference between my "regular" DVD player and this "upscaling" DVD player. I don't personally think the "upscaling" is worth the additional cost.
__label__1 doesn't work: It simply doesn't work. First I thought I don't spin it fast enough, but that is not the issue. I am glad I only spent 10 bucks on it.
__label__1 ouch... not so good: I loved Kuschner's first book. It was writen through him, not by him. I was so excited to see he'd written another book. This book was written through ego. He was told he'd written a first great book and to teach us again. He wrote the book and it was more about how he sees religion as the answer. He ignored other processes of people. His first book really guided us to sort it out for ourselves. This book hit you over the head with religion. Sad, I'm religious, but don't want people scared away being hit over the head with it.
__label__1 It Sucked: I love Capt. Lou Albano. He is a great man. Unfortunately, his book is a flop. There are too many mistakes on wrestler's names and the book confuses wrestling moves. Also, the book mistakingly mixes up the history of events in wrestling. It is not a good buy.
__label__2 Elliott Wave Principle: Well written and relatively easily understood publication on a somewhat complex if not esoteric approach to the issue.
__label__1 Not that funny: I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so. He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it. He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics. I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world. All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later. Still lots of people think he is great
__label__1 Ok but nothing great: Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series.
__label__2 Urban Legends: Urban Legends, while many times seem to be an American thing, often over lap in other cultures. Koma is basically the story about the infamous waking up in a bathful of ice finding an internal organ missing.Granted, your probably thinking been there, seen that, as I was before I watched it. However with enough twists and creepy dialogue through the movie, this psychological thriller turns from bland to thought provoking.
__label__2 Broad Spectrum Spirituality: Stay home and relax in the comfort of your easy chair, a lovely cup of tea at hand , and let Kamarino struggle through the Amazonian jungle, the temples of Thailand, and caverns of the heart. This is an unusual book about the very personal quest of one young man. He covers allot of ground here, enjoy!
__label__1 Laughably terrible...: This 70s made-for-TV movie couldn't get any worse. I actually liked it because it was so terrible. The film is about two truckers who must drive a mysterious cargo to a destination to recieve the incredibly large sum of $3,000 each! On the way they run into some trouble, with a guy who looks like Fidel Castro after them and some bar thugs try to stir up trouble. There isn't really a hijack in the whole movie, but there are plenty of pointless action sequences, like when a random blue pickup tries to run a semi off the road. Notice the pointless two bales of hay in the back of the truck. Also notice how it randomly explodes after being run off the road! The one image I will remember from "Hijack!," though, is the stirring presentation of a lone man leading a semi truck through a valley. For literally fifteen minutes. Pure stupidity at its best.
__label__1 Pure Junk!!: This slicer has no pros only cons. After washing the handle leaks water out of it all over the cheese (yuck!), it isn't adjustable and the slice is very thick. OXO has some good utensils this isn't one them. I am currently seeking a new cheese slicer and will be throwing this one in the trash can where it belongs!
__label__2 Shows the details of Meat Packing as well as Socialism.: This book basically disgustes you with the real and harsh details of the Meat-packing industry. Although it might have been a little exaggerated, it shows you the reality in which the immigrants had to face during the American Industrial revolution. With all the difficults Jurgis (the main character) had to face, later he finds out about Socialism. Basically Upton Sinclair's purpose, as a mugraker, was to show the great parts of Socialism. The last few chapters are detailed about the great socialsm. And, like most stories, ends with a happy ending.
__label__1 not a good reference manual..or book on computer security: In a course, this book was used as teaching material in a class for computer security. The read, reminded me of speaking software to a hardware engineer. Since the hardware engineer is coming from another level, the experience was like talking DOWN to the reader. The author seemed to want to "impress" us with his "knowledge". Luckily, we were fortunate to have an instructor that could translate for the class. Had to use other manuals to replace what the author, may have tried to relay.
__label__2 Excellent for 4-year-old: We borrowed this book from a friend and then had to buy our own copy. It has good illustrations, is easy to read, and is short enough that my 4-year-old son had it memorized after just a few readings. Now he "reads" it to me and, since it IS memorized, its easy for him to remember what options he has when he gets angry. Excellent book!
__label__2 Prompt Service: Received my Bower Pro Lens Cap Keeper for SLR Cameras in a timely manner and just what I needed - great service!
__label__1 Two Physics Professors Say Don't Buy This Toy!: It looks great in the picture, but don't be fooled. My husband and I are both physics professors and we bought this for our daughter's ninth birthday. When we unpacked it and discovered that all the planets take exactly the same time to complete an orbit, we were appalled. That a company which calls itself "Educational Insights" would sell a product which promotes completely wrong thinking is misguided and unforgivable. The only thing a child can learn from this is the order of the planets, and for that a stationary model would be much better.
__label__1 Ls Angel Voices - Kit EDI with Cards: The angels meaning is too short. It does not explain the meaning of a card if it comes head down. It also does not explain, how many times the querent can draw the seven cards. The cards supposedely talk about the past and the future but what about the present moment in life? it would be helpful a complete book with a detail explanation on how to manage, read and interpret the cards. i'm looking for it.
__label__1 The Night Stalker: I had become very interrested in Richard as I grew up in California and lived there durring the time these crimes happened and was all scared all over California so I had to know why. I also felt compelled to know him, to know why, and to understand why. After reading this book, though I felt the author had him already guilty from the beginning of the book. He tells about all the horrible crimes as he says Richard explains them to him, then goe's into the family history, they the capture and court preceedings. I thought in the US one was innocent until proven guilty. It's not what happened here all though there is overwhelming evidence here, the fact remains, that this man's rights were violated.......... The author had to be in it for the money, otherwise he would've started from the life of the Ramirez family or the court proceedings then the life and then the crimes he claims Richard confessed to him. Another great injustice in our so called freedom of the USA.
__label__2 Worked when other cleaners didn't: One day, I decided to tackle all the small stains on the carpet in our eating area... which not-so-surprisingly fell victim to the millions of things that have graced our plates. NONE of the cleaners I had worked and then, I saw a bottle of scotchgard oxy that someone must have left behind because I don't recall ever buying it. And it worked! I was so excited, I went around the carpet searching for stains (some of which had been there several years), just to delight in how great this thing worked. I haven't used it since, but I am certainly glad to have it just in case.
__label__2 Good as a Rolex at a Fraction of the Price: I just received the watch I've been dreaming of for the past seven years: an Invicta 9938 Pro Diver Swiss Automatic. As good as a Rolex at a fraction of the price, but still a lot of money. However, if it lasts more than a dozen years, it will have paid for itself, and I'm expecting it to last more than a couple decades.The band on my Invicta 8935 Pro Diver Japanese Quartz broke after seven years of faithful service, so instead of buying an new band, I decided to buy the much better Swiss Automatic, which should last even longer. Actually, I'm hoping this will be the last watch I ever buy for myself.
__label__2 A must have for progressive rock devotees!: I first heard this LP upon its initial 1973 release and was truly enamored with the groups unique sound. Orchestral arrangements and classical meanderings in such titles as "Il Banchetto" and "River of Life" left me suitably impressed and eager for new future releases. The translation of original Italian to English lyrics was lacking to some extent but the melodies, progressive and classical, are first rate.
__label__2 Excellent: I am a fan of the creator already, and this movie puts it all into perspective. This movie came on time and in excellent condition!! Thank you.
__label__1 do not buy: I would like to express my disappointment in my order with these toys. I ordered for a Christmas present for our God Daughter but i cant even consider giving them to her because of the poor quality. what a waste of money.
__label__2 The BEST Little Stick Vacuum: We recently installed a hardwood floor, and vacuuming is recommended for daily cleaning. Not wanting to haul out the large vacuum, I checked Amazon, and it appeared that the Hoover S2220 would match my needs.This little powerhouse exceeds my expectations! I can zip around the room, which includes the hardwood flooring and several scatter rugs, in no time; in fact, can also do the adjacent tile floor and hallway--all in about five minutes.The power nozzle is powerful--perhaps even doing a better job on the scatter rugs than I regular canister vac. I know that some reviewers do not like to empty the cup, but I'm not finding that to be a problem. I would just recommended doing it every week or so, so that it doesn't build up.It's GREAT! No problems here--happily recommend!
__label__2 Good pair of Binoculars: Good light gathering. Sharp image. Easy to focus. Great warranty. A bit heavy to carry around.
__label__2 INCREDIBLE!!!: This is an amazing cd and it has a few hilarious hidden tracks! It's oozing with energy - great job guys!
__label__1 I agree with the first review by the reader from Palo Alto.: I, too, was disappointed by the book. A tourist guidebook could have done the same. The author had not even visited some of the places she listed. She also stated that she had never even seen a "ghost" herself - I find that incredible, after years of ghost hunting!
__label__2 Orchestra rehearsal, von Dohnanyi, Haydn: This is an honest take on orchestra rehearsing--interested in the mechanics of music making, sharing a few of the conductor's conceptual drivers and some of the orchestra's members reactions too. So while it doesn't touch on the higher notes of, say, truth telling through music it does very well at what it aims in title. Throughout the material, the conductor makes several assessments with respect to Haydn's works and his approach towards them. On a subtler note, one gets a glimpse at Christoph von Dohnanyi's personality and character. Good sound, less than great camera work.
__label__1 Before You Put That On: The book was a complete disappointment. I bought one for me and one for my daughter...we both returned them
__label__1 Why Do Other Regions Get the Proper Aspect Ratio?: I was so excited to see a "Special Anniversary Edition" for Annie. I was sure it would be widescreen anamorphic. But, alas, we Americans are given another "pan and scan" version of a "scope" movie. Why? It seems someone, somewhere, (and there seems to be a lot of "someone's") is hoping to kill the DVD and Blu-ray industry and thus worsen our economy. (I include Blu-ray because we keep getting so many B movies released while the "Classics" are held back or offered first to other countries.) Why are we getting such pittyful releases? You now have to go to Australia or England to get the "goods". Anyone in the "know" know why? (This reviews the format not the movie itself.)
__label__1 HORRIBLE!!!: Bottom Line: this is the absolute worst album I have ever heard in my entire life!!! I felt like throwing up after I heard this cd. Every song is about cars, jewelry, women, money, and partying. The beats [stink], the songs are annoying, and his lyrics are annoying. Bottom line: the worst album of the year. I don't hate Fabolous but this album is wack! His last album was wack too! Rap is going to cave in if these rappers don't start putting out some good music.
__label__1 Annie's review: Would not open up right on my laptop! What a disappointment! The games were not very challenging and my husband doesn't even play them. It was a gift, not a good one
__label__2 MY AWAKENING by DAVID DUKE: This is the best book I have ever read concerning racial understanding.Dr. Duke describes the root causes to America's (and the world's)foremost problem.A MUST READ FOR ALL CLASSROOMS.I have bought multiple copies and given to all my relatives and friends.I have even pushed the book online at various Yahoo club sites and chat sites attracting the interest of thousands .Educate yourself and get this valuable book/Thank you
__label__2 She says it all: The author,Kathryn F.Staley reads balance sheets and company reports for fun. In her book she tells you where, when and how to look for candidates for a profitable short sale. With emphasis on the perils of short selling Mrs. Staley clearly points out that this is not a field for the faint of heart. You need to have a knack for raw fear to qualify for the ecclectic world of profitable and very wealthy short sellers.This book clearly is more than a starting point - it encourages you and sets you on track.
__label__2 Must Read: This book is a must read for anyone who has either read or plans to read the Bible or the Torah. This book gives you a good base too start from.
__label__1 don't bother buying it: I didn't have time to go see it in the theater so I was excited when it came up for purchase. What a disappointment. Gathered up the kids and the popcorn then fell asleep twice watching it. Save your money for something else.
__label__2 six-year-old loves it: I bought this for my grandson on the recommendation of a mom who reads to her primary and preschool kids. What a hit! The next book is already on his Christmas list, and his mom posted a quote in "dragonese" on her facebook page. They are looking forward to reading the whole series with its quirky drawings and side notes that add another dimension to the stories themselves.
__label__2 Good cheap ram: Purchased for then boss' Toshiba laptop to give it some more room and max-out the RAM. Worked fine. Cheap. What more can you ask from notebook RAM?
__label__2 little book big smiles: Such a fun little book about a little pea with a different idea of good food. I smile every time I read it.
__label__2 Helping the idiot understand gnosticism: The "Idiot's Guide" provides an excellent review of the historical roots of Gnosticism which I found extremely helpful as there are so many characters in the story. The book then goes on to break out the main points of each of the gospels; encouraging the reader to do their own research and form their own opinions.
__label__2 You need to broaden your mind: I love Disney music, but you know what, I do not always want to listen to Disney music. This is a great collection of songs that are interpretations of disney songs done in the artists style. TRULY GREAT BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR LIFE.
__label__1 More of a hard cleaning product: I bought this product because I needed to clean my hardwood floor. When it got here I realized how hard and unpractical it would be to use it everytime I needed to clean my floor. There is nothing wrong with this product, except to the fact that it will only be good as a hard cleaning product, like cleaning your car wheels, barbecue grill, gate etc. It takes a long time to heat up and once you've turned on, you better go all the way until the water is over. The noise is not bad at all like others mentioned. Good luck
__label__2 Tom Continues to be an S&OP Leader. Check Out His Recent Webinar Online: It was truly a pleasure to have a person of Tom's experience, insight and humor anchor a recent webinar event for us entitled, "Myths, Misunderstandings and Misinformation About S&OP".

__label__2 Couldn't put it down: ... I am neither an acquaintance nor family member of the murder victims whose plight is recounted in Ms. Stillman's book. Nor am I a past or present resident of Twenty-nine Palms. I found this story to be engrossing with the a depth that goes well beyond a specific incident in a specific desert town. It is loaded with symbols and meaning that speak to a much broader America. That people whose lives are entwined with this story take issue with the author in their reviews is no surprise as Ms. Stillman writes with chilling candidness. As a third party reader, I found it to be a quick and exciting read and I found Ms. Stillman's writing to be very evocative especially in the way she describes the desert.
__label__2 Great buds for the price: These are very good earbuds, and I thought I got a great deal on them, $18 on ebay, until I saw that Amazon had them for $15! Nonetheless, these have good sound. I don't believe the sound quality is any better however than the earbuds that come with the Zune 8gb, but because they fit in your ear canals, they will cancel out most of the ambient noise, and are WAY more comfortable. They also come with 3 different size rubber pieces to fit most any size person's ear. They also have good base response for earbuds. The case they come in is nice to have, but a little difficult to wrap the cord perfectly so that it fits back in well.
__label__1 Interesting magic,terrible editing. High-school plot,people.: David Farland has potential but he needs to learn how to write a grammatical sentence, or at least get an editor that knows how. His characters don't always act realistically - several have frank multiple personality disorder. One can only suppose Mr. Farland meant their sudden rages or other inexplicabilities to be gripping, when they're really just the opposite. Plus there are many times he simply botches character development or plot devices. This reader rolled his eyes too many times at _The Runelords_ to want to read the sequel. Poor grammar, poor plot structure, poor pacing. Farland's interesting notion of granting endowments by runes is far outweighed by this book's over-abundant flaws. One guesses that the author dusted off something he wrote in high school and sent it to Tor, who published it because it's lengthy.
__label__1 died too soon: Got this unit and it worked fine for 2 years, but with VERY moderate use. I may have played 3-5 discs a week during that time in the unit. Almost 2 years exactly to the date of installation, the CD player died (it would not eject the disc). With the very light usage I gave this unit, that is not acceptable.
__label__2 Classy looks and accurate readings: Wow, I am surprised by all the negative reviews!I love this scale. It looks great and has always given me an accurate and consistent reading. It's nice to be able to see your weight fluctuations to two-tenths of a pound. This is the best scale I've owned.The only downside to this scale (and the reason iI'm giving 4 stars, not 5) is that you have to tap it with your foot first and wait several seconds before you can step on it. Sometimes I wish I could just hop right on, but the wait is short so it's not terribly annoying.
__label__2 Strong blender: Had this for 2 yrs and use it everyday for smoothies. Crushes ice like nothing. It's loud but it's a great motor so it's worth it. No options but if your looking to purée this is for you. CON: don't twist the bottom of the container on too tight or you might crack it like me. Would buy again!
__label__1 Undersized by two sizes!: I ordered this for my child who wears a size 10-12. I ordered a large which was stated to be a 12-14. This costume was WAY too small. Due to time constraints, I had to cut a hole in it and he had to wear shorts over it. The large is comparable to an 8-10.
__label__1 Not that good.: I was really looking forward to reading this book. Didn't know what to expect, but kind of was thinking along a bigger timeline. I did like the fact that Vader was still thinking and complining like Anakin while at the same time Vader was also growing.Didn't like the other characters in the book. The Jedi that survived and the smugglers that helped. I didn't really care what happened to them, who survivied or how who died. Very poor character development there.My other big gripe is that this book pretty much starts and ends within weeks of the end of the Clone Wars. Like I said earlier, I was expecting to cover more time wise.
__label__1 remastering HORRIBLE!!: save your money!!!!, dont support ANY business people that release products without providing a decent return policy.The Riaa is suing children , but an honest consumer trys to return an opened product (which was sealed, and carrys NO gurantee of quality)in a local Record store and cant, because the labels dont allow them to return it. Where is the consumers rights going to be recognized in the cd trade?
__label__1 Very Poor Quality Phone and AT+T Service: BAD phone/Sevice! Renewed my Cingular/AT+T service with 2 of the Samsung SYNC A707 devices with AT+T. Been 45 days and could not be more disappointed! Very Poor quality! been through 2-3 batteries each phone and now one does not get any signal (eventhough bars showing). Spend many hours with AT+T tech - since over 30 days AT+T/Samsung not very helpful at all. I read these reviews everytime I purchase something new -please DO NOT get this phone or AT+T service!
__label__1 Works - terrible usability: A must have if you want to watch Blue Ray on your Playstation (since PS3 only uses Bluetooth, not infrared remotes) The layout of the buttons is horrible, the DVD controls are lacking, there's no way to control my Sony TV volume as with "normal" Sony DVD remotes. I have Sony everything, yet I still hate this remote (and the fact that I can't program my universal remote to manage my PS3). When will Sony learn - give customers what they want, not what Sony wants. Sony never has been high on usability, but this it one of the worse examples of usability ever for one of their products.
__label__2 Soap is gone. Long Live Soap!: Love it! Love it! Love it! One of the funniest shows ever made for TV.
__label__2 SOOTHING SOUNDS: WHEN THINGS GET CRAZY AT WORK, I JUST POP THIS IN AND LET IT TAKE OVER. BEAUTIFUL RECORDING!!!
__label__2 love it: I have been eying this set for a while when macys was selling for 199 +tax on supposely 400$ retail price...but then again..whoever pay retail?finally I check it up at the store and it was beautiful and not too heavy and not too light and also no metal chrome on the edge...my last set had those metal chrome and microwave hates it and heats up the plates....Those were fancy but cannot use microware is trouble for re-heating food.I checked amazon and it's selling for $167 and no tax no shipping!...can't let this deal go...so I bought it last week.it arrives through UPS today and I can tell you it's a huge huge box and is heavy.... opened it right the way and all pieces are good! no broken plates and no broken cups.I am happy.$167 for 45 piece of mikasa...now I am going to look for some other pieces to complete this set.
__label__1 DEFFINITLY not what i was looking for: i bought this book expecting to further my knowledge of guitar, me having a pretty good sense of theory found this book to be lacking in many ways, this author obviously is writing this book under the influence that the reader already knows what he is talking about in terms of musical language, if i was a beginner, i would have no idea what he was talking about. He seems the have the idea that just being told to do something is better than telling someone to do something then telling them why. I have to say, i was asking myself why a lot in this book.
__label__1 junk: you get what ya pay for, this is a cheap piece of junk,light worked two times,even with several battery changes
__label__1 Item received is not as shown in the picture. Can't use it as it is delivered.: The picture shows a male and female hose fitting along with two hose clamps. Those are NOT included with the 1101 adapter that I received.You must have the two fittings to be able to cut your existing PowerBleeder hose then be able to use both your existing adapter and the universal adapter #1101. The PowerBleeder doesn't have a compatible fitting that this will connect to!
__label__2 BEst: I have never had a problem with this watch, I have dropped it, thrown it, and it has gone thru the mud and water, and it still works like brand new. I would Highly recommend this to a friend. For the money, you cant complain.
__label__2 Great for our cruise!: I'm an airline pilot so I have expensive and very durable suitcases, but I didn't have a garment bag and needed one for an upcoming cruise to pack my dresses in. This one was perfect. The size was enough for 3 of us to pack our dresses and even fit a couple of pairs of shoes in there too. The handle and wheels held up for the short distances we used them.I thought it was great and especially since it was under 50 bucks.
__label__1 Very Disappointed: I purchased this over 6 months ago and feel as if I wasted my money. It just wont hold the charge even after charging overnight it will only run for a little over 5 minutes before it dies. I wish I could find my receipt and take it back.
__label__1 For God's sake, finish the damn thing!!!!!: I read the first two installments of this project with some enthusiasm thinking I would likely enjoy it since it was being made into a TV series and I enjoy some fantasy works. And I did enjoy them for a while. But this book goes nowhere and I am sick of the characters. I want some resolution and I understand there are at least two more books after this one. It goes on and on ad nauseum. This whole story could have been done in a couple of good books instead of dragging it out so interminably. I can't finish this book and I am sure I won't read anymore of Martin's work. I get the strong feeling his writing is more about the $$$ he can pull in from poor suckers like me, than about producing a good, readable tale. Enough is enough. I have better things to do and read.
__label__1 Cheap up front, expensive in the long run: Works good, replacement bulbs are expensive, the ballast on the first one lasted about two years, this was a replacement purchase.
__label__1 Movies on Parade Version.: I can't speak for the other version that Amazon is going to group this review in with but don't buy the one with the Orange banner on the top that reads Movies on Parade. The video transfer to DVD is terrible. The pictures varies widely from too dark to see anything to washed out bright. The sound is just as bad. It looks like someone put a videophone on a tripod. Watched a decent recorded a decent version of the movie and then made a DVD of the recording from their phone. It is pretty much unwatchable.
__label__1 Doctor Pew: This time out, Doctor Who trades in his TARDIS for a time traveling HONEY BUCKET and becomes Doctor Pew!
__label__1 abusive love story......: this was my first book by this author. First, let me preface my review with the acknowledgment that the author has obvious talent.I actually enjoyed this book immensely for the first 150-200 pages. Then the author took a 360 degree turn with the characters and storyline. This is one of those "old school" romances where the hero/heroine "hate" each other and spend the last 150 pages running away from each other, yelling, basically treating each other like dirt.While this may be the makings of a great "woman's fiction" type book. In NO way is this book a romance. Conflict I can live with-these two characters were nothing but downright abusive to each other, as well as putting their daughter in the middle of their madness. The "real" world is filled with enough destruction-this is not what I read romance for.2 stars for the first half of the book.
__label__2 Great Book with Great Ending!: I loved this book. I enjoyed all of the characters and the adventures they took. I also liked the pace of the book. It was NOT one of those boring, wish I was finished, books. I also like the ending. Of course I can't tell you what is so good about it. You will have to read it for yourself!!!
__label__2 TITAN TITANIC COINCIDENCE?: They (fed bankers)and their agenda got rid of about 600 industrialists who were opposed to taking over the fed. JP Morgan said hey let's all talk about it while we cross the Atlantic and he, missed the ship at the last moment, and these game changers were prevented at gun point from entering the life boats.Amazing how life imitates art or, is it? Futility indeed.
__label__1 Doesn't stand the test of time: I remember hearing songs from this musical sung by Judy Garland on the recorded soundtrack. While Ms. Hutton is funny on the screen, she in no way can compete with Judy Garland's amazing voice.Honestly, when I listen to the prejudice against women, minorities, etc. in this 1950's version, it's not a 'play for all times' that offers enduring values."Annie Get Your Gun" is based on the real-life story of Annie Oakley, the crack shot who was a member of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show and perhaps the first female superstar. If you actually want to watch Ms. Oakley's life on film, try "Buffalo Gals" instead.Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
__label__1 BORING: Most disappointing - Long on minutiae, short on performances. Outside of the Robert Johnson re-creation and the original Skip James material, this series will put you to sleep. A case of Style over Substance. Man... what could have been!
__label__2 Enjoyable Fantasy story: If you love LOTR, D&D, MTG, or any other fine fantasy, you'll enjoy this series. I'd highly recommend it. Purchased vol's 1 and 2 from Amazon and am soon to purchase vol3. :)
__label__2 Dylan 101: This was the very first Bob Dylan album that I bought --- on 8-track tape! --- back in the early 70s, starting me on a multi-decade Dylan addition. In today's age of ultra-long CD compilations, this may not be considered great value for the money due to the relatively meager amount of minutes, but you can't fault the quality of the music on here. These tunes are all great, absolutely essential listening, and a great way for the beginning Dylan fan to get their feet wet ... or ears tickled ... or mind blown. If you are curious about why Bob Dylan is so revered and respected, get this CD. This is the best introduction, short of splurging for a boxed set of multi-disc collection.
__label__2 AWESOME...: To ALL the impatient idiots who bought this bed, the bed does not leak air it's simply the plastic expanding the first few nights...This is a great bed, far better than anything you could ever buy @ Wal-mart or Target!
__label__1 Not a good resource. There are much better guides available.: The book made me think of a big box full of broken china. There is a lot in there, and if you are willing to work very hard you could make it usefull. SMS is a very complicated product and cheif among the goals of the writers should have been to make clear how the peices of the app. fit together. Look for another book.
__label__1 Trash: I am sorry to say that I wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this "film". The story does no make any sense, the special effects are laughable and the script/acting crude. Please, do not waste your time!
__label__2 Very fine: Learning the whole of Bach's six Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin is a remarkable feat. Playing them with such perfect sensitivity and expression falls squarely in the realm of the superhuman. Even after repeated listenings, certain movements of this recording bring a lump to my throat and make my heart flutter. Violinists especially, I think, will discover special meaning and beauty in this recording. However, anyone who listens to classical music will find this recording to be one of the jewels of their CD collection.
__label__1 read this if you think natural is the ONLY way: I was ready to learn about the actual birth process at around my 6th month of pregnancy and picked this book because it looked very complete and informational. Unfortunately I came to find that it was entirely biased on the side of natural birth and that if I chose pain meds it meant I did not "value the birth". Also the information given about pain meds and giving birth in a hospital left me feeling like all my original plans for birth were not good enough. I would not recomend this to anyone looking for the unbiased facts. Read this if you already feel that natural childbirth is the ONLY way to go. This book will be very supportive of you.
__label__1 10x longer than it should be: It seems a lot of people have benefited from this book, but for me, I didn't find the book very appealing. I'm still trying to make sense of the program, though I admit I did skim the last 100 pages. It was much, MUCH longer than it needed to be, imo, and it was scattered and fragmented in so many different sections and topics, my head was spinning. The core program could have been described in a few pages, but then again, that wouldn't be a very marketable book.
__label__1 Drums along the Nohawk: I'm 50% Nohawk and 50% Nearoquois Injun. I'm from the Mohawk Valley in Upstate New York, and I'm perplexed that this book didn't contain a reference to Auriesville Corn - the bestest corn in the world. Lie-zy, how could you?
__label__2 TROUBLE MAN: This book was a very good read. Every man need to read this book. It will give them an insite of how to be a real father to your child. I really enjoyed this book. It had its basic drama, but I really thought Jermaine was going to be the kidney donor for his little brother. I enjoyed this one.
__label__2 Thrilling view of a possible future Russia.: Thrilling and very detailed work. Easy read. Very cloak and dagger/james bond style of adventure. Good language(no swearing). Characters are very plausable and add to the suspence of the story. Wonderful history of Russia and its quest of a unified nation without Communism.
__label__1 NOT THE SWIMMING MERMAID: I ordered this for my niece with the impression it was the Storytime SWIMMING Little Mermaid ... because that's what the item description says! I just received the doll. It is part of the MGA Storytime Collection: Princess Dolls ... It is NOT the MGA Storytime Collection Swimming Little Mermaid Doll! Don't be fooled! Going to return it and try to find a swimming one on eBay.
__label__2 best visual aid: I bought a few books that deal w/ this subject when I got a new job as an OR nurse. this book is the best at allowing a person to study instrument recognition without having to have the actual instrument to refer to. I was able to go to work, scrub in, and w/ very few exceptions, know exactly what I was looking at.
__label__2 Much better than the Genie!: All my friends got the Diaper Genie but I picked up the Diaper Champ after it had gotten a Best Of review on The Today Show. I've been thrilled with my purchase-my friends aren't so lucky. They have to spend so much money on the specific bags that must be purchased for the Genie. We just use regular old kitchen trash bags. We love it and definitely recommend!
__label__1 Off center: Nice overall, but several of the security holes are so far off center as to make them useless. With the cost of shipping it makes the item impractical to return. Would be nice if there was a way to exchange the defective items.
__label__2 Best book I have found on subject!: I have read six books on college financial aid and this is the hands down winner. It has everything you need to plan and execute a faultless fiancial aid strategy. I checked this out of the library but I am buying my own copy. It is a good read and a good reference. It has all the secrets to getting the most financial aid possilbe with web sites of places to get more info.If someone finds a better book for parents, please let me know!
__label__2 LOVE Cybill, missing my favorite episode: LOVED the Cybill show; loved her humor, loved her out-there episodes, loved her not being a size zero, loved her silly struggles with her commercial acting jobs and how her friends and family react to watching them. Unfortunately, one episode is mislabeled as Going to Hell in a Limo, Part One, but it is not - plus I REALLY REALLY liked the second part better with Seth Green and the ending at the Hollywood sign. So, did not get to see either part of one of my favorites. Darn. But loved her valentines day episode and her explanation on why it was one of her favorites. Would really like to be able to get the whole series.
__label__2 Lovin' Life: Although some parts of this book were wordy, overall I thoroughly enjoyed it. The book enabled me to see more in to the life of Jackson Browne, and to understand more of what he is about. I know it was not an approved biography. After reading it I'm not sure why he disapproved as I did not find it derogatory in any way! Interesting and a good read overall.
__label__1 ????: This game is like EA sports is trying to take a back step from Knockout Kings 2000. I am a Boxer and i know how a Boxing fight should look, and coming from a Boxers point of view, this completly lacks realism. The graphics are much worse as is the gameplay compared to K.O kings 2000, they have added much better features and made it more interesting, but the graphics are horrible. The boxers foot work is too slow and their arms look like they are about to snap off, sorry EA sports, this one just doesn't cut it.
__label__2 Perfect Character Actors: MGM's David Copperfield was a great opportunity to make use of some Hollywood's great character actors, and the film does so to great effect. Of course, the film is based on Dicken's famous novel, although the story is condensed. Freddie Bartholomew stars as the title character, a young boy eventually orphaned who meets a host of characters as he grows up alone. Although Bartholomew was actually one of the better child actors in film history, he never captures this character and his performance sometimes seems forced and ineffective. However, he is surrounded by an incredible group of actors playing memorable supporting characters. Basil Rathbone, W.C. Fields, Edna May Oliver, and Roland Young are all excellent in roles that only Dickens could have written. They make the movie. The film features the usual MGM production values and is well worth a look.
__label__1 My least favoruite live Celine album: Of the 6 live Celine cds I own, this is by far and wide my least favoruite. On first listen I find something about them I like, not this time, and that is sad.1) The short version of 'It's All Coming Back To Me Now' is blasphemy.2) Far too much talking (for my taste) between songs, shut up and sing!3) Too short, the total cd time is Sixty one minutes EXACTLY.4) No live version of 'A New Day Has Come'Now for the good points (which were hard to find):1) Live versions of 'I'm Alive', 'At Last', and 'I Drove All Night'2) Her version of 'What A Wonderful World'3) The DVD is nice, but not enough to save this.While not all bad, not one of my favourite live cds. I'll stick with the import 'Live At Olympia' and 'Live In Paris' as well as the two other live cds I have, much better in my opinion. I realize that this is from Vegas and Vegas means big, but after listening to it I hope that when her stay is over she gets back to a real show.
__label__1 It does charge batteries: This thing does charge batteries, when it's plugged in. It's getting the stubby prongs to stay in the outlet when filled with heavy batteries that's the problem, and it's a pretty big problem.
__label__1 WARNING Not a True Widescreen TV!!!!: They may mention 16:9, but it's actually a 4:3 set that can play 16:9 on it. Heck my 32 inch tube can do that. I can't stand when they put deceptive information on product descriptions.
__label__1 Poor design: The backboard is connected to the base by three short bolts that screw into three metal connectors that are set in the plastic of the backboard. This connection failed on first use (without slam dunking). I tried to set the connectors back into the plastic of the backboard using superglue, but that didn't work either. So, I drilled holes through the back side of the backboard and replaced the three short bolts with three very long bolts. This re-design is working just fine. I'm very disappointed in the original design, and wouldn't recommend this product to anyone!
__label__2 Spiritual Tale with Suspense and Jazz: Not the usual reader of spiritual novels, I found this book to be very refreshing. Going beyond the good vs. evil tale Gallanter's novel weaves self-awareness, self-success, and how we as individuals fit into a larger society. I was able to identify with the characters and enjoy the book on several levels: literary, spiritual, and simply as an enjoyable read. Anyone who believes that we fit into a bigger picture - regardless of which particular religion - will find value in this book.Gallanter leads the reader on a great journey that conjured up Stephen King-like characters. A throughline of jazz - both literally and figuratively also recurred throughout the book.Enjoy!
__label__1 Worked well in the beginning...: I used this shampoo right after using the EverSleek Loreal shampoo/conditioner. It was causing build up and made my scalp itchy/flaky and my hair heavy/greasy after a few months of using it. As soon as I used this Neutrogena shampoo, my hair was clean, itchy/flaky scalp gone. After a couple of months, however, the same thing started to happen with this shampoo/conditioner.
__label__1 A ***Huge*** Disappointment: Incredibly overrated.Lame.Boring.A huge disappointment.Painful to sit through just a bit of it.Not funny at all.Should I say what I really think about it?Just my opinion, I realize; but, IMHO, watching this movie is a waste of time, life, money, oxygen, space, etc.An intriguing plot line that, unfortunately, goes nowhere....Repeat, absolutely nowhere.So sad....I must confess that I am not 100% honest in my review...I actually feel the movie deserves no stars, or negative stars. Unfortunately, that is not an option here at Amazon.
__label__1 Despite the other reviews...this book is inaccurate: I am a typical, blond haired, blue eyed, dyed in the wool patriot. Yet one thing is for certain, this book really twists the truth a lot!!!I won't bother writing a 5 hour count by count review. Just do this...go to your local bookstore, sit down and peruse any number of historically accurate accounts of the crusades. Neither side was innocent back then, however, we Christians were certainly cruel, murderous, treacherous and terroristic in our battles.This book by Spencer makes it out as if we are sweet little innocent victims. We are not. This does not mean we should be sorry. I cannot possibly be responsible today for what happened hundreds of years ago. I am simply saying...BE HONEST and UNBIASED if you're going to write about history.
__label__2 Review of Aarom Copland CD: Appalachian Spring: I used this CD as part of a dance history class on American Modern Dance, in conjunction with a DVD on dance pioneer Martha Graham. The music stands alone, and my students got a bit of music history along with their dance history.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: Hooked my Wii up to my new TV with this cable, and the picture instantly became awful on games! Lines running across the screen, buzzing background noise, etc. It is like watching a 1970s TV with rabbit ears for an antenna and all the "snow" and static noise. Terrible. I guess I wasted $10 bucks...and now I'll go back to using the standard RCA cables the Wii came with. :( I learned a lesson too, you get what you pay for. Maybe I should play around with it some more and see what I can get it to do before the hassel of returning it.
__label__2 How can you not like Karl Urban??: The movie is a bit gory, but it tells a good tale. I liked the strategies Ghost used to battle the Vikings. He was outnumbered and needed to use his wits in order to defeat them.
__label__1 doesn't contain smells: Like the other reviewer, I too thought this was great for about a month. Once my infants diapers actually started to smell, The diaper dekor was horrible. There was a constant odor in the room and when you opened the lid, it was even worse. I'm not impressed with the triple sealing lid at all.
__label__1 Hate these diapers: We've been using Costco diapers for 18 months but got a good deal and couldn't pass it up. I'm sorry I did because these diapers leak. They have too much papery stuff around the edges and too little padded area to absorb pee. It's also hard to get these put on correctly because there's so much papery edging. I'll never buy them again.
__label__2 NO NAME INSTRUCTOR, DAMN LOTS OF KNOWLEDGE: FINALLY A NO NAME INSTRUCTOR THAT I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF, BUT DECIDED TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE BY PURCHASING HIS BOOK. DAMN THIS GUY GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT. HE COVERS EVERY ASPECT OF JEET KUNE DO, LIKE WING CHUN FIRST FORM, EXTENSIVE EXPLANATION OF THE BASIC TECHNIQUES AND THOROUGH EXPLANTION OF THE TERMINOLOGY. HE ALSO COVERS THE COMPLETE WOODEN DUMMY FORM, AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART HE COVERS, SCIENTIFIC STREET FIGHTING AND HAND TRAPS S0 WELL,AND HE EVEN COVERS NUNCHAKU! I PRAISE HIM ON HOW MANY PHOTOS ARE IN THIS BOOK. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ONE BOOK THAT HAS THAT MANY PHOTOS AND DEMONSTRATIONS. ITS LIKE FIVE BOOKS IN ONE,GOOD JOB!HIGHLY RECCOMMEND. NOW I SEE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE FAMOUS AND HAVE A RECOGNIZED NAME TO PUT OUT A GREAT PRODUCT AND HAVE THAT MUCH KNOWLEDGE. THIS GUY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT!
__label__1 the ppv was horrible: it was bad period this ppv wasnt good there was a total of 1 good match juvi vs rey vs kidman vs psychosis and i doubt it was even in the last hour which means wcw didn't hype it besides they had matchs like benoit vs mike enos what the hall kind of ppv match was that (don't buy this movie)
__label__1 not easy to use: I bought these to store milk before I went back to work. They work fine when I'm home with all the time in the world. I've back to work for 4 days and find these bags very time consuming...opening the bag, threading the twist tie, attaching it to the shield, pumping, deattaching it, and closing it. Pumping can take up to 25 minutes. Not something that can happen 2-3 times a day. And I'm never sure how much I've pumped. When the bag is attached to the shield it says 1 thing, but then you seal it up and it says anothers. Today, I'm going to buy bottle set. They close just as tight and are much easier to use.
__label__1 "Stop complaining...": All of you who that are complaining about this blu-ray are the one's who purchased this set, come on admit it. Blu-ray 50GB has the room to fit both versions- absolutely right, no argument there. But the fans will never be satisfied. We all knew that this set would be the theatrical editions many months in advance. I had a chance to see this set, and The Fellowship... is a really inferior transfer, but I borrowed the set from a friend who received this for from WB for an advanced review. I will not by this until both versions are available together. The Two..., and The Return... do look promising. A nice step up from the DVD versions. Just remember that blu-ray is still a new format, and we almost certain will not get what we want all the time. Just think in a few short years everything from CD, DVD, Blu-ray, and 3D Blu-ray will make way for digital downloads. It's coming sooner than you think.
__label__1 I Wanted Ronald Not R: In listening to Body Kiss, I could not help but hear R Kelly all throughout the CD. Now that Ronald Isley has taken on the Mr. Bigg persona via Mr. Pied Piper, getting him to produce the whole album vs one or two cuts as in the recent past was a mistake. I am afraid that those of us who remember the real Isley Brothers vs the latest incarnation will be disappointed. Now in giving the album a chance, I listen to it a couple of time and then listened to their previous album "Eternal" and this is what the Isley Brothers were to me back in the 70s. Even though it did not receive any airplay, the title track "Eternal" is a beautiful love song. What in the world is Lil Kim and Snoop Dogg doing on a Isley Brothers CD? Mr. Pied Piper did a remix of the main song on the CD "What Would You Do?" at the end of the CD and man, that is horrible. Word to Ronald Isley - put Mr. Bigg to rest, use R/Pied Piper sparingly and get back to the formula that most of us remember the Isley Brothers for.
__label__1 not that great: You know i hear people say how great the virus are. FOLLY!!!!FOLLY!!!!!Lets dress hardcore and make songs that sound like rancid thats really cool. Who would want to sound like tim armsrongs no talent ass clown band anyways? If you want to listen to hardcore bands that dont suck on punk core records than listen to the vraukers or clt 45.
__label__1 Not a healthy food.: Thought I'd try this as a cheaper alternative to the expensive prescription diet my vet recommended. Researched further & added canned food, cranberry supplement, & water fountain. No problems so far & feel much better that my cats are back on their meat-base food. This stuff even smells bad. Was worried since a Purina brand & I normally do not buy any of these poor quality foods, but tried it.
__label__1 Bad Deal: Normally I have had great success with ordering products through amazon.com. My good luck has run out with the ordering from Barnett's Online.I can't fault their initial customer service response. They did try. The first refurbished cartridge arrived promptly. Problem was that it did not work. I mailed it back as instructed. They sent me a second refurbished cartridge. That did not work either. They promised a third cartridge and a full refund. The third cartridge never came and to date neither has the refund. I know the problem is not with my printer since I am still using my old cartridge even though it's very low on ink. I will have to find another vendor and hope for the best.
__label__1 About a recent purchase: I made a purchase of this product, for a Christmas present for my daughter, and instead of the genuine parfum,I received a "fake parfum" smells like desinfectant, and when my daughter used it, began to feel nausea and vomiting, I am very dissapointed with this purchase, and want my money back inmediately. Don't buy this piece of sh.....
__label__1 Flimsy, massive structural crack when I was using it.: I'm 180 pounds and I was using two 35 pound dumbbells. A bit of angular momentum put some torque on the corner of the leg, and it snapped on me. I'm lucky not to have been hurt.Even if you're smaller than me, I would recommend avoiding this bench. Get a safe, solid bench.
__label__1 a poor book...: This book really did not cover any topic thoroughly enough for the reader to get a thorough understanding of the topic. I found that the authors did not use vector notation at all,(they were introduced once and then never used again) apparently deciding that vectors were too advanced a concept for introductory students. The only thing I have to say is that my general high school physics course was more advanced than this. This book truly does not convey the fun that physics can be.
__label__1 No longer "complete": This book is feeling its age, and it is no longer "complete." It is ok for libraries that still use a card catalog since most of the lessons for the upper grades are based on it. I would recommend finding a different book if you are looking for lesson plans.
__label__2 Item is great, but only 19.9% Potassium salts of fatty acids: Item works just like insecticidal soap should, its just not as concentrated as description states. The picture shows the correct stats when you zoom in.
__label__2 Awesome adventure movie: This is a great Tom Hanks movie. My favorite of course is Forrest Gump, but this comes in a not so distant second place. It's about a FedEx Delivery man who's plan get's stranded on an island. Very good movie.
__label__2 Fantastic new argument on Human Sacrifice: I first read this book years ago in college and loved it. I would say I read this book at least once a year. His theories regarding human sacrifice, scapegoating, and our evolving interpretation of death are incredibly interesting and have helped me narrow down the topic I intend to study for my anthropological post-graduate program. This is well-written, well-researched, and is an excellent introduction to the subject for the general reader. I highly recommend this book.
__label__1 The Goonies are Stupid: Worst childrens' movie ever. It's stupid and unrealistic. This would NEVER happen in real life. Plus what child enjoys seeing a pale, dead body fall out of the closet? AWFUL.
__label__2 A comprehensive book.: This book is comprehensive and well-written. It's one of the best books on the subject of the lost tribes of Israel.There is information on the camp arrangements of the tribes and the brigade emblems. These emblems are identical with the "four living creatures" found in the Bible.See Ezekiel 1:10 and Revelation 4:7.Mr.Bennett covers or includes the following:The mention of Israelite captives on Assyrian monuments.The witness of the Apocrypha and Josephus regarding the lost tribes.The Scottish Declaration of Independence(translated into English).An appendix detailing the view of Jewish scholarship.What is interesting with this particular index is that Jewish scholars have held that the lost tribes of Israel have not re-united with Jewry.The Index of Scripture Passages and Index of Persons,Places,and Subjects are convenient as a reference.I recommend this book for anyone that would like to study this subject.
__label__2 TIGHT CD: this is lunasicc's tightest cd ever the beats and lyrics are koo and they hit hard u gotta hear track 1 and 4 they are off the hooook!
__label__1 Poor quality recording: My girls love the stories, but the quality of the recording is poor. It sounds like the Berenstains recorded it in their basement....
__label__1 Not good: John's CD is not good. His first was excellent and had many, many great tunes. This CD has one good song on it and many bad ones. He should be ashamed of this production.
__label__1 Buyer Beware: We bought this camera last October....It is small and compact which is a major plus. I have noticed that 80% of the pictures I have taken, have the red eye. We just recently went on a cruise, and the camera does not take very good quality pictures inside a comedy club with decent lighting... the people moving around were blurry. Lastly, when I went to power on the camera yesterday, it makes an awful noise, and then the screen blinks the canon logo, then goes black with an E18 error. I contacted Canon, and its not covered by warranty, and the repair will cost more than the camera did new. They claim that it was due improper use or mishandling. The camera went dead while it was on, and the shutter is left extended... Recharged the battery, and now the shutter will not go back in... and thats MISUSE? I will never buy another Canon ever...which is why Im at Amazon.com right now to purchase a new camera.
__label__2 Hands down one of the best book ever!: This is by far the best book ever. I have purchased more copies then I can count and I have given it to all of my family members and most of my friends. All of them loved it. Even my mother told me it was one of the best books she had ever read. Being she reads a book every two weeks that's a pretty good compliment.This is a short book, but it takes a long time to read. It's not that it's a hard read; it's just that it's so good you will take your time to read it. Almost like savoring a great wine.I don't recommend many books, but this one should be on the top of your reading pile. Once you read it you will understand why and I'm willing to bet you will recommend it to all of your friends.
__label__1 Do you believe in life after Too Much Joy?: Too Much Joy was a terrific, underrated band that never really got their full due. Wonderlick consists of Tim Quirk and Jay Blumenfield from that band. The album sounds like Too Much Joy, to a certain extent...but the unfortunate extensive use of electronic drums and vocal processing give this album a mechanical "hip-hoppy" feel. If you abhor the "vocoder" steppy-vocals effect used by Cher on her excruciating "Believe" single as much as I do, then it's all-too-frequent use on THIS record should give you ample reason to avoid this recording at all costs.
__label__1 Buzzwords Galore: Read this if you are or want to be a middle manager who needs to know the words to understand the boss. It's also good if you can't get enough of your current middle managers voice but that's about it. Perhaps if I had read it 5 years ago, but now it's just annoying. I think a new process is in order.
__label__2 Glamour Ain't All It's Cracked Up To Be: Dang. This was like a rollercoaster ride. It was so much fun it made me dizzy. If this is what Hollywood is like, I'm almost grateful for my normal 9-to-5. Makes me glad I never wanted to be a star. Keep up the great work Lolita. This book was the real deal.
__label__1 Have had better transmitters for the iPod: We used this Monster product for a year or so after a prior FM transmitter for our iPod died. We found the sound quality okay, as good as any other transmitter-type FM/iPod product - but it was difficult to find a station we could stay on for more than a few minutes, and switching stations was a pain. We had a cheaper product than this before that we liked better - we could read the display better, there was FAR less static and we didn't have to switch so often. We do live in an urban area and that may explain some of our problems. But we finally decided to give up on this one and try another one. It's just too much of a pain in the neck to use.
__label__1 Dick's Picks #3 is similar, and better: First of all, I wasn't there.I was disappointed by this set.The music is lifeless and driven by a plodding disco-ish beat.I much prefer the 1972-era material which is almost uniformly on fire.Many of the songs on this CD are performed in a much more lively manner on Dick's Picks #3, from 1977. In particular, compare the two versions of "Samson" and "Franklin's Tower". The Dead Set versions sound like the kind of songs a has-been band pays on a summer cash in tour, while the DP3 versions boil over with drive and energy. In particular the DP3 "Franklin's Tower" is a shimmering, grooving all too short 15 minutes long, while the Dead Set version sounds forced just to make it to eight minutes.Still looking and listening!
__label__1 Extremely bland and not remotely the flavor of Pad Thai: I liked Dr. McDougall's split pea soup and his oatmeal, so I decided to try this.Oh man. I could not believe how disappointing this was. The ony PRO was that it was chock full of noodles. If you love rice noodles, the Asian style, this has oodles.But the flavor was lacking. So bland, it was like someone took the soup and watered it down and served noodles in saltyish water. It's called Pad Thai soup, but as a pad thai afficionado, I can't say I noticed any resemblance to pad thai--other than Asian noodles.If you like watery noodle soup, go for it.If you actually want a burst of Thai yumminess, this is not a soup I can recommend.Mir
__label__2 Excellent marker: Update: We have now used this marker for over 2 years and it continues to work as well as it did the first day. We have shot several thousand balls through it with no problems. The only thing we have done to it is replace the spring after about a year.Original Post: I got this marker for my daughter for Christmas. This marker is very well built, stylish, and has a decent barrel. After shooting approximately 1000 balls through the gun it didn't break a single ball and only used about 14 oz of CO2. The marker is definately more accurate than my Tippmann 98 with stock barrels installed and it is MUCH lighter than the Tippman 98 Custom. The only disadvantage is that the vertical feed prevents you from sighting down the barrel as you would with a real gun. However this is true of any verticle feed gun and is mainly just a matter of getting used to it.Excellent marker for the money.
__label__2 RIding lawn mower blades: these are just as good as if not even better than purchasing at SearsIt would have been almost $40. at sears and I paid $25 Can t beat that
__label__1 super constipation: I ordered this item because I could get it included with the free super saver shipping. Also, I generally like yerba prima products. This one, however, really plugged me up. After the 1st week of the "gentle" cleanse I was constipated so I decided to apply the heavier cleanse(doubleing the dose). This really plugged me up so after another 7-8 days or so I threw the remainder of the capsules out and went back to the psyllium husks + colon care formula and was regular in 2-3 days. This may work for some people but not for me!
__label__1 Excuse me....GORE LORD???: GORE LORD? You have GOT to be kidding me. The band name is a laugh riot in itself! And look at those song titles! Ridiculous, even by death/black metal standards!Thank you, Gore Lord, for making me laugh again. Next time I need a good laugh, I'll just pop your CD in and let the good times roll!
__label__2 Great Dances!: This workout dvd is great! Unlike some dvds it goes slow so you can get the steps down. I break a sweat everytime I dance. It's fun unlike other workout dvds. It gives you 5 types of worksouts to do, so you can work any part of the body. I reconmend anyone to buy this energetic dvd!!
__label__1 I usually like Denise but....: I've been a Denise Austin fan for almost ten years now. I used her videos in my 20's to loose some extra weight and I'm using them again now in my 30's after having a baby. There is no doubt her videos get results and I'm sure this one would too. However I HATED this video! The pace is so fast when she transitions from one move to another that by the time you get it she's onto the next one. She's also never been really great about giving ques when the move is going to change but this workout is the wort I've ever come across. If you are new to Denise Austin please don't get this video. It's horrible and you'd never want to try any of her other workouts. I also didn't find anything about this that was specific to weight loss after a baby. I had a c-section and found some of the moves uncomfortable to my stomach even after waiting six weeks to work out. Any of her other videos would be great to use for weight loss.
__label__2 Much improved upon: The second generation Ipod Nano is a definite improvement over its original predecessor. The color choices are nice and the new aluminum-coated outside is great for protection, especially for those that will use this item solely for exercise purposes. The improved battery life is also great--unfortunately, it still doesn't last as long as Apple claims, but it lasts much longer than the original Nano did. The improvements make this item worth purchasing.
__label__2 The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros: I just read this lovely book for the first time and I have to say, what took me so long? Written by Sandra Cisneros, you are immediately drawn into her world, you see what she sees, you feel what she feels. Simple eloquence. A coming of age story written in little short bursts of her Latino neighborhood in Chicago."Marin, under the streetlight, dancing by herself, is singing the same song somewhere. I know. Is waiting for a car to stop, a star to fall, someone to change her life."
__label__1 Blink 182 Suck, Just like this album: I love Fenix Tx, The band that produced the great album 'Lechuza' so I decided to take time out to listen to this cd, turned out to be a huge waste of time. All this sounds like is another poor blink 182 album and I personally hate blink 182 as there the worst band ever, they sound terible and are just made too public. So if you like real punk, dont buy this but if you love the whole blink 182 pop punk 'stuff' buy it.This album SUCKS!
__label__1 A true waste: The coffeemaker has so many problems/ The first coffeemaker I bought leaked water from the tank - Delonghi replaced it with a new maker which doesn't pump water to the coffeepot.... I feel it was true waste of money .
__label__1 Extremely large dice.: I ordered these dice to play with dice cup for a fun night of liar the game. Sadly when they arrived to my home they appeared to have been used. The dice were warn & scraped up. Also they are very large barely fit into a dice cup. Much larger then the ones that would come in your average board (16mm) these are (19mm) much larger then what I was expecting. I did my research never realized there were different sized dice. So I hope this helps the normal dice I'm used to & you may be used to are 16mm these that I am speaking about are 19mm much bigger I noticed the difference when I first took them out the packaging. I ordered some other dice 12mm much smaller but they look great & are a perfect size for any dice cup u might have.
__label__1 Fun has'nt started yet....: I got the e300 yesterday and am all excited about it. I have two issues, though:1) The item was rusted ! The place on the base where you insert the handle was rusted. Not sure if there is any saftey issue with this.2) The valve extender to inflate the rear tire is missing. I opened the right side handle sleeve and peeked in but couldnt find any.I cant inflate and the equipment cant be used till that time.I have emailed the seller and waiting for response. I will be updating this review (and rating) on what happens next - amazon's response, seller's response, my overall customer experience and, of course, the product itself - when I can get to ride it.
__label__1 Disappointed: I've got Gucci "Envy Me 2" by Gucci for Women - 3.4 oz EDT Spray (Limited Edition) and was very disappointed. The box was not even sealed, and the smell was not as expected. It did not even last for 5 minutes! When I contacted Scented Monkey, I was told about 20% restocking fee in case I wanted to return it. Considering the shipping cost and 20% fee, I decided just to forget about that. I paid $43 something and it was like a total loss.
__label__1 More Plot Development, Please: Legion is an apocalyptic horror/action movie that centers around the birth of a child and the legions of angels sent by God trying to kill it. The movie begins with the archangel, Michael, leaving God's army and traveling to protect the unborn child at a diner/ gas station in the desert.This movie has decent special effects, casting, and cinematography, but lacks substance. The focus seems to have been on visual stimulation and not a well detailed plot. All of the bits and pieces are there, but the story was not developed enough to give this movie real substance. It is a wax apple compared to a real apple, it looks good and nice to eat, but it doesn't have a real matter to it.I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie; you'll end up not hating it, but not caring about it either. Oh, the movie was really predictable too. I don't like watching movies when I think I could have written it better.
__label__1 They should have called this: MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL BORE!: MOUNTAINTOP MOTEL BORE would have been a better name.I am into these old, 70/80s horror flicks (POLTERGEIST TRILOGY,THE OMEN), and I was expecting this film to be great.However, this movie was a great disappointment.An old lady goes slightly insane, killing her daughter's pets and then eventually her daughter. After this, she opens up her own little motel where she is at full insanity and begins hiding out underneath the floors and coming up to hack every guests.This movie is too long and boring. The acting is terrible, which I expected because the cast members have never been heard of.The story is weak and I'd say that this movie is just plain [junk].Trust me, go rent a POLTERGEIST movie. This movie is horrible.
__label__1 Horrible Quality: This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking.
__label__2 Mothers Worked Great: I never heard of clay baring until I started looking into how to care for the finish on a 2008 car I just bought. Everyone said to first clay bar, then wax. I looked into it extensively. Based on reviews of Mothers I tried it. It worked great! The cars finish is now as smooth as a babies bottom. The car didn't really need it but you could tell there was some stuff on the surface of the car so I figured that it couldn't hurt. I did put a tarp under the car and did drop the clay bar a few times so this saved a few clay bars. It's not a big car so it didn't take as long as I thought it would, less than 2 hours. It actually took less effort than I thought it would. It comes with 2 bars but I cut one in half and used just that half and that did the job very well and looks good enough to use again (can you use one again, it looks as yellow as when I started). I highly recommend Mothers.
__label__2 Decent version of the classic: While not my favorite, this is a decent version of the classic tale by Kenneth Grahame. This version is made by Martin Gates, and is in full screen, The colors and characters are good for kids, the length is 71 minutes. Now the Disney version is fun, but too short. The best animated version in my mind is the one with the live introduction by Vanessa Redgrave produced by John Coates (who produced The Snowman). It is beautiful, sticks closer to the original book than any other.So again, this version is decent and fun to watch, great for kids, and if you want to see another version of the classic it is worth a a viewing.
__label__2 Brilliant: Really enjoyed watching this. Saw this years ago and wanted it for my collection so I can watch it over and over again. Highly recommended. Great quality dvd.
__label__1 It Makes No Sense: We live in the 21st century and so I suppose it's inevitable we'll show our children some television. But this Baby Beethoven DVD is exactly what I don't want my baby watching. The "program" (if it deserves that name) runs about thirty minutes, and it's a medley of cheaply recorded classical music segments, each of which lasts just a few minutes at most. The visuals that accompany the music are disconnected not only from the music but from each other. Essentially, it's a half hour of footage of out-of-fashion toys and simple animations, and set to bad music. If you want your baby to listen to Beethoven, I think you're better off buying an actual Beethoven CD. If you want your baby to listen to Beethoven *and* watch something at the same time, buy Fantasia.
__label__1 Burn this Bedeviled Instrument!: My parents swore that they loved seeing this film in the 1970s. I was expecting to like it and it had the opposite effect. This movie is not half as good, or well-produced, as "Mandingo." The main character is supposed to be biracial, but like Tom's and Helen's children on "The Jeffersons," he is obviously played by a monoracial actor. The slaveowner's daughter is supposed to be a girl, but is clearly a woman. Like many blaxploitation films, this promotes homophobia in the form of a racist, predatory, bisexual, white character. I am as Afrocentric as the next brothaman and even I was insulted at how black equals good and white equals bad to the nth degree here. This film is not campy and will not make you nostalgic for the 1970s like "Dolemite" may have. This film was poorly done and insulting to the extreme.
__label__2 Absolute worship: This is a totally new experience with Delirious as the band continues to create new music for praise and worship. This album filled with songs of all kinds, spreading love of God. "Stronger" and songs like "All This Time", "Miracle Maker", "Our God Reigns" and "I'll See You" are brand new feelings that gives u a soothing yet strong feeling. It gives a pleasant feeling unable to describe, just like the words of God. Besides that, songs that really rock your heart will be "Now is The Time", "Solid Rock" and "Paint The Town Red". "Now is The Time" guest written by Matt Redman and also cello solo by Gerard Le-Feuvre in "Our God Reigns". Totally worth buying CD! You'll just love it just as I do.
__label__1 B O R I N G: I have to admit right off that I didn't watch the whole movie, perhaps the ending was worth it but you'd have a hard time convincing me of it. I watched an hour and 15 minutes of this movie and just couldn't see continuing. At this point in the movie I had a fairly good idea of where it was going to end - seemed to be a cover-up, that quite a few people were in on a murder. No matter - it was very slow and very very dull and boring. If the ending was exciting as heck it still wouldn't be worth sitting through this to get there.Obviously, I would NOT recommend this movie.
__label__1 Let Sleeping Vets Lie: BEWARE, I purchased this series thinking they were a continuation of James Heriot's first four but to my disapointment the publisher riped off the public by reprinted the original stories under a new title. I tryed to return them but gave up and donated them to the local library
__label__2 AVATAR: GREAT video... amazing new world. This is one of the best movies I've seen recently... and more amazing in blue ray!
__label__1 Why should they hate U.S.?: They have a higher standard of living than us, they being Europe, Great Britain, and Canada. They have free health care, have shorter work weeks,longer vacations, and stronger currencies. While I as a citizen of the U.S.of America work two jobs just to pay my taxes.I find Mr. Gibson's premise bogus.
__label__1 Mediocre: It wasn't what I had hoped for. Actually, it seemed like a couple of funny experiences stretched out to make a book.
__label__2 A joint crowd pleaser!: I think this item is great for kids. I gave it as a Christmas gift for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She enjoyed painting the horse and since there are two in the kit, she even let her twin brother join in the artistic endeavor. They both had fun.
__label__1 Tastes awful: I wanted to try tea tree oil toothpaste so I bought a couple. This one was awful - very medicinal tasting and didn't leave my mouth feeling refreshed. I much prefer Jason Healthy Mouth. It too has tea tree oil. It tastes a little medicinal but not too bad and it refreshes your mouth.
__label__2 Review of Titanic: Blood Y Steel: I watched part of the series on my cable station and loved it. Decided I wanted to buy it and watch the whole thing---great service and great DVD.
__label__1 mass production paperback books from Amazon.com: My husband and I both were looking forward to reading this book.The quality of this book is the worst I've evre seen !!! The print is so bad its a struggle to even try to read it. I'm sure the story line is good but when the print is so light or even missing in spots its hard to tell. The only reason I didn't return it was because my husband threw everything away except the book. That will end up in the garbage also ! I certainly expected better from Amazon.
__label__2 The best book on software engineering that I have ever read: "Code Complete" is the only book that thoroughly and objectively covers every aspect of the actual coding process. It was even useful reviewing points that I had already known because he gives such good reasoning and evidence to support his statements that it helped strengthen existing convictions.
__label__1 Cheap JUNK: I only bought this because it was cheap. My buddy bought one as well and the first time he used it, half of the switches stopped working 10 minutes into use. I thought i would have better luck. Mine lasted 20 minutes before 3 of the 8 switches have stopped working. They are cheap and guaranteed WILL BREAK.
__label__1 Not as advertised: Just received this bumper and when I opened the box I was disappointed to find the bumper was not the same as pictured and advertised. This bumper does not have any D-ring mounts, only a smooth surfaced bumper. It's disappointing because the D-rings are the main reason I ordered this item over others.Buyer beware, you are not getting what is shown in the picture.
__label__1 Not a bad guide except....: This FF7 strategy guide is good, but there is one HUGE problem with it. IT SPOILS THE GAME FOR YOU!! It shows in detail one of the best parts in the game(the end of disc 1), along with more minor parts of the storyline. which I really hate to see happen because FF7 is such a great gameeee with a incredible story line. It will help you play the game, but I highly recommend not buying this guide
__label__1 Didnt enjoy it: This video is all bloopers...it doesnt show any skits completely. Glad I bought it used. Still think my mom will enjoy it though.
__label__1 Only Looks Nice: It looks great, but the media pad makes it too wide. The battery on the media pad doesn't last very long so I ended up (not wanting to replace the batteries again) just not using it. I usually use the number pad so this was a real inconvenience. The mouse is also too heavy for my liking. I'm buying something else!
__label__1 Had to meet a deadline: I was enjoying the book Passage, keeping the pace of page turning while waiting for more! But the more never came. I was so disappointed when I reached the end and didn't get #1 a finality to the plot, nor a reasonable ending. This was the first book I have read by Connie Willis and picked it up due to a review and the fact she lives 10 minutes from my home. I think with the way it ended Connie had a deadline to meet and abruptly ended it. I must admit I gave the book to my niece with the suggestion of using it in her book club in Breckenridge. I feel it is a great book to discuss and rewrite. I enjoyed the characters very much and felt they were well defined only abused by the author.
__label__1 wig: I just ordered this wig also, but was afraid it would not come it time. I also just recently bought it at Justice store for 16.99, plus 20% off. I will hang on to the one I just bought from Justice until I receive the one from amazon, or if It doesn't come I will cancel my order and keep the one from Justice. Unfortunatly you can't always depend on internet, sometimes you gotta go old school!
__label__1 BORING: I have not been this bored watching this DVD in a long long time!!! She talks too much, and explains way more about the history of belly dance than she does about how to do it. The segments do not continuously play either. You have to manually select each section.
__label__2 Beautiful: These are beautiful. My fiance loved them, and they match her ring wonderfully. The blue is deep but still flashy, and the gold is a wonderful touch.
__label__1 A Historical Disaster: This movie is an absolute INSULT to anyone who has served in the Navy. It is without question the WORST I've ever seen from a technical standpoint. Their technical advisers should be ashamed to cash their checks. What a joke!!!I had high hopes for this movie, and suffered through all the romance garbage only to be appalled at the blatant problems with the action secquences. MAN! SO many shots of ships that weren't even BUILT until long after WWII. AND even worse, all those shots of ships with NO HULL numbers. DUH! No hull numbers means NOT COMMISSIONED!Well, if you want to see a film about Pearl Harbor, SKIP this joke! IT is a fictional love story that insults anyone interested in history!
__label__2 an extraordinary sonic experience: This is a great performance. The tempos are crisp and the diction clear. the DTS version produces a great auditory stage == better than PCMs or CDs. The Beethoven ninth -- paired with the Carmina Burana is also nicely done.
__label__2 A book to read while lying in your hammock: This book describes the history of how lawns were first introduced to American, became popular, and then became a necessity. Jenkins traces the early history of lawns as importations of the English country garden concept, as found in Jefferson's gardens in Monticello. She also explains the influences that garden clubs, the golf industry, and the USDA had on the popularization of lawns. The book is not just about lawns, however. It also provides a very interesting analysis of how advertising was used to create demand for completely unnecessary products, and how those products, such as lawn mowers and weed whackers, later came to be thought of as indispensable. This book will be of interest to historians of landscape architecture as well as to researchers of material culture.
__label__1 COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!: A child is supposed to be able to make pictures with this either with their finger or the pen included, it hurts to use your finger and the pen is no help. Pictures are impossible to create and it is very heavy. Very disapointing and a complete waste of money.
__label__1 Sloppiness and Lack of Insight Make for a Disappointing Read: I picked up "Scare Tactic" after finishing William Castle's very engaging memoirs, "Step Right Up! I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America." There is very little original material in John Law's book... most of it is just a rehash of Castle's memoirs, in which Law re-tells Castle's anecdotes, sometimes refuting them. (Mostly on minor details like dates.) Law offers a few terse observations and insights of the man's life, but not really until the very last 10 pages of the book. The most glaring and offensive thing about this book is how poorly it is edited: simple mistakes (like spelling "Ursula" "Ursual" or "their" instead of "there") dot almost every single page, making this book seem even more amateurish. I suggest picking up Castle's memoirs instead... they're much more entertaining and better written.
__label__2 Holds up well: I love command products, and these are every bit as great as the hooks! I use them to hang charging cords from the side of my nightstand so I'm not constantly fishing them off the ground. They work great, and have a little clasp that will hook to hold them tight or unhook to let the cord out. The clasp does not unhook when jostled, which is great. As with all command products, make sure to wipe both the back of the hook and the surface that you plan on adhering to with rubbing alcohol. Regular household cleaners don't work.
__label__1 Doesn't Live up to Bedtime Stories: This collection does not live up to the Politically Correct Bedtime Stories book which was pretty good and by the same author. These stories are not funny and are not interesting either. Seems to just be cashing in on the success of Bedtime Stories and Once Upon A More Enlightened Time. Buy Bedtime Stories but give this disaster a miss.
__label__2 Product Review: Product worked as expected. Arrived within stated timeframe. Functioning properly so far. No complaints.
__label__1 boring book: I did not like this book because I thought it was boring. I like action much more than peaceful books. If you are the kind of person who likes slow, peaceful, detailed books then this book is just right for you.
__label__2 Another vintage, must-have book from Ruth Webb Lee.: I was skeptical about the usefulness of this "handbook" when I ordered it for $3 but have been really impressed. It contains very little text (the first 5 or 6 pages only) but rather is filled with photos...every page! It's a super book to look for the numerous, assorted, early Boston & Sandwich pieces that don't qualify to be listed in her books about cup plates, etc. I have found it very usefull in identifying several items like 6" lacy plates and various shallow & deep bowls.Get a good, clean copy if you decide to order it. This is a paperback book so I was careful to confirm that it had a tight binding before ordering. In short...this book reflects the same high quality found in Ruth Webb Lee's other numerous books.
__label__2 the best movie ever created: THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER CREATED!!!!!!!!!!!! my cousin and i saw it in the theatres a billion times!! my dream is to meet nicole kidman and ewan mcgregor!!!!!! They are the best!!! This movie is absolutely outstanding!!!! IT IS WORTH SEEING OVER AND OVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE MOULIN ROUGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! you will see no one else who loves this movie more than my cousin and I, if u think u like it more than me...well, i beg to differ~
__label__2 Made a Great Gift: I bought this book to give to our choir director as a going away gift. I didn't read it, but he did, and he thought it was a great addition to his library.
__label__1 never feed them to a friend: I bought a 24 can case of these and will never do it again. I should have heeded others reviews but I thought "I'm not that finicky". You don't have to be finicky to disapprove of these. (1) They've got a stringy thing hanging off of them. (2) They are small (3) If they haven't fallen apart by the time you open the can, they will by the time you get them to your mouth. Probably more wrong too but I'm trying to stomach my way through them by making stew. I have to put them in a strainer first to rinse off whatever crap that is on them, cook them in butter and lot's of salt & pepper before I put in milk. Then close my eyes & try to palate them. I would never feed them to a friend. I think Amazon would take them back but they have been so good about that on bad products I hate to ask them.
__label__2 Good AC Adaptor: The AC adaptor was bought for my JVC eAvinu GPS and it worked out of the box !!! The different kinds of adaptors that come with the kit is more than enough to get you started with devices in the 3.3 to 12 volt range.Was a good buy for 14$
__label__2 Great for beginners: This book is a great help for beginners. Getting the basics and push your skills a little bit more. I fully recommend it.
__label__1 packaging ugh!: OK....so I do love lifesavers. But I don't want to have to fight to open the stupid packaging of every single one of them. What's up with that? I have arthritis and this is a real chore trying to eat these things.
__label__2 Great product: I watched the seasons and wanted a copy for myself before the series gets canceled now I have Johhny Smith and all his glory. Just what the Psychic ordered.
__label__2 Excellent!: I love this cd. It's one of my favorites. "With You I'd Believe" is my favorite song on the cd. It is fabulous. It just may be my favorite song from ALL the cd's I own. It's a wonderfully uplifting song. The only song I didn't like was "Love Me". I don't like when the smooth jazz artists throw in a vocal or two- for me it usually takes away from the cd. However, the other songs were so outstanding, I still give it 5 stars. I just skip over that one.
__label__2 Excellent innovation!: I find UpLevel an invaluable tool for working with clients. As an EMDR therapist I welcome all good innovations, both in theories and procedures. Robert Yourell's CD is certainly one of those excellent creations which enhance my work. Clients find themselves processing traumatic and blocked material, in depth, as they use this CD with therapist's guide. I highly recommend it!
__label__1 This is still inaccurate. The true story isn't told.: My grandfather was on the manufacturing team for these vehicles, and this book does not tell the full story of it's design and fabrication. There are only four members of that fabrication team with us now, and the only member of that team that was crucial to Mr. Hall, Mr. Sharp is not mentioned in this book. This is a disappointment considering the author and the time he spent researching a very closed community of talented indivuduals that helped build motor sports as we know it. The full story is still out there.
__label__1 Please Shoot This CD: First off there is one good song on this CD believe it or not, "Right back Where We Started From" and actually it sounds out of place with all the other crap that litters the remainder of this disc. These songs are best forgotten--they sucked when they came out and they suck now. If you must listen to them then attend a wedding reception.
__label__1 A Pedantic Windbag: I rather enjoyed Mr. Fletcher's earlier books. But his cruise down the Colorado is the essence of tedium, filled with the sort of philosophical meanderings usually found in fortune cookies. He even makes shooting the rapids seem boring -- he has the amazing ability to take an interesting subject, and completely suck the life out of it. Though there are fine moments, overall, I couldn't wait for the trip to end -- I mean, how many times can he talk about the photo he took 40 years ago at a Mexican border crossing? He's a writer who's a bit too in love with the sound of his own voice.
__label__1 Shareport doesn't work... for anybody.: I purchased this router mainly for its usb shareport ability. It doesn't work though. I went online to see what the problem was. Turns out shareport doesn't work for anybody. It worked when it first came out, but an update to the software rendered it extremely un-reliable. It will connect for about a day, and then you have to reboot the router to get it working again.Total crap product. I wouldn't buy this router if you plan to use its shareport functions. Otherwise, the router works fine.
__label__2 Lucid and elegant -- a true classic: Lanczos' book is a compelling analysis of the principles of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. It reminds me a bit of Feyman's Lectures on Physics because it focuses on the motivating principles behind advanced mechanics. In an elegant and flowing style, Lanczos guides the reader through a walking tour of the principles of mechanics, peppered with historical footnotes. If you understand how to use mechanics, but want to understand how the underlying principles are developed, this is an excellent choice.
__label__1 A classic? Why?: I have no memory of Northern England late 1700's. I don't no if characters such as Heathcliff or the younger Linton actually could exist. But this whole story is so unbelievable that it goes way beyond fiction. Not only that but one of the basic requisites of any successful novel, or movie for that matter, is to have at least one character that the audience likes or will root for. There is not one character in this book that I pulled for. Not one that I wanted to see come out on top. I just finished this book so maybe my viewpoint will change with time (in five months will this novel have any impact on me) but for the time being this hardly rates as a "classic"
__label__1 Horrible! My cat hates me now.: My poor cat has ear mites. I diligently followed the instructions and her ears are all red and scaly. Terrible terrible product. You're better off going to the feed store and buying ivermectin paste. Now that's about the same price, maybe a buck or two more and figure out the correct dosage (24 MICROGRAMS/ kilo).Sucks sucks suck!
__label__1 A great record for a new emcee, but Cube should know better: What happened to Ice Cube's angry style? It has disappeared totally. Cube now sounds like a parody of himself. His lyrics are tight, but nothing like AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted or Death Certificate.I got a lot of respect for Ice Cube. The old Ice Cube that is. If this was his debut album, maybe my opinion on it would've changed but he should know better. The CD is only okay. Cube fans will be disappointed. I hope The Peace Disc will be better.
__label__2 Mosin Nagant Hangers: For the longest time I wanted to mount my Mosin Nagant on my wall but wanted something quality to do so and these were my solution.The mounts are VERY sturdy and mount securely enough to hold a Mosin Nagant 91/30. They have a felt pad where the rifle sits too so they wont damage/ dent any wood on the rifle which is very nice. I would highly recommend these hangers.
__label__2 Best season yet!: The season finale of Season 4 was by far the best episodes (two parter) I've ever watched and I've watched every rerun on oxygen for the last several months at work. I recommend any House lover to watch this!
__label__2 Great grinder: This is a great pepper mill. It allows for fine to course grind and does a good job of staying where its set. Holds enough to last about 1 month with average use.
__label__1 Not the original versions: Don't get burned! These are inferior re-recorded versions. For whatever reason it was done (and I know artists gotta eat, and Mitch deserves more fortune than he's got), it's terrible. Buy Rhino's "Rev Up" instead.
__label__2 How many hour long episodes are there?: I've been watching this excellent series on the Military Channel. Was it shown in the U.S. before? I don't recall seeing it on PBS or the History Channel. Was this series released in 2003?
__label__2 Good Price: Good price for emergency blankets. I hope I never need them but with cold weather here, its a small price to pay for some added security in the car.
__label__1 Please someone shoot me and put me out of my misery: This may have been the single worst audio book I have ever listened to. I could not relate to the shallow characters, and the plot was not realistic enough to be believed.The whole premise is rather weak anyway, if some kid had a deep secret about "Big evil food coporations" just email it to all the major newspapers. I mean really...
__label__2 a moderate workout: This is a smooth machine. Easy to use and move. My husband likes it, I don't care for it too much. It works well but the workout is not intense enough since there is no tension. I knew that when I bought it so that is on me. I get bored on it before I get tired. If you are looking for a light or moderate workout this is great, but if you are looking for a challenging workout you probably won't be happy with it.
__label__2 Not at all what it seemed.: Jake Gyllenhaal truly rocks L.A. as a police officer. This movie is one of the years best. The DVD will soon find a home in my library
__label__2 Works with Mac OS X (Tiger), Virtual PC and Garmin GPS: I bought this for one specific purpose: to attach my Garmin GPS Vista to my Mac (using Tiger) and then be able to use the Garmin software in Virtual PC. So you can imagine the hoops I had to go through. But despite all that, it installed without pain and works flawlessly both within Mac OS X as well as within Virtual PC (running Windows 98).
__label__2 Bloody Brilliant!: I really loved this movie. I would watch again if had to. This movie kept me up all through the night considering I saw it around midnight. The film kept me wanting more.
__label__1 Did not work well: This product did not work as well as I expected. They tell you the chip on your windshield will be invisible when you are done. I tried this on 3 different windshields with different size chips. The chips are still quite visible.
__label__1 A VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCT: Mine broke on the inner wall. But I didn't disover that until I'd drunk the entire glassfull of tea. Fortunately the five razor-sharp shards all lodged between the two layers of the glass. But I was lucky.This is a VERY DANGEROUS PRODUCT.With conventional single-walled glass, you know immediately when it breaks. With this glass you risk ingesting glass shards every single time you drink from it.The product(s) should be recalled and banned. I have reported this to the Consumer Products Safety Commission.
__label__2 It is good but not exactly what I expected: It is leatherman, it has a lifetime warrenty and I have always had success with other leathermans.
__label__2 Forget educational value!: Anything that helps prevent stepping on one of these die cast foot demons is a God send and gets 4 stars from me. This is basically a glock that has been recycled into a box that holds hot wheels. It becomes a weapon against little sibling when fully loaded, so make sure to get 2 if pillow fighting is too tame for you. It does what it was made to and then some!
__label__2 Wow! That's powerful!: There are many choices out there for blenders, but all the rave reviews for the Oster BPST02-B helped me decide. It is a nice blender, seems to work well. Has plenty of power and the lack of different settings isn't an issue. I would have given it five stars, but for a "Professional Series" blender it lacks the quality heavy metal collar to hold the glass container, and the plastic cover on the underside of the unit says this blender LOOKS LIKE a Professional Blender but is short on quality craftsmanship of real heavy duty blenders. Bottom line-it's worth buying.
__label__1 Good player, poor author and teacher: This book is almost totally useless in teaching gin rummy to a relatively new player. It utilizes primarily an anecdotal approach using exclusively examples from games in which the author has played. While this may be interesting to the author's friends and competitors, it is of little or no interest to a member of the general public. Do not waste your time with this book unless you know the author.
__label__2 Castle series: Great series. Don't know how I missed it all these years. Will be buying the rest of the series soon.
__label__1 Dangerous: My 9 year old daughter is very athletic and excells at all sports but these things are difficult to master. Very large danger of ankle and leg injuries from falling and twisting the ankle. Maybe it depends on the body type of the kid; mine is tall and thin, built for speed not strength. Maybe a stronger kid could do it. These are going back.
__label__2 None better: This facsimile is wonderful, though there are no other facsimiles of Cotton Nero A.x to compare it to.For anyone interested in either the marvellous dialect or the skill of this anonymous northern master, this facsimile will not disappoint.The introduction by Prof. Gollanz is likewise useful, though not so much as an artifact as much as for Prof. Gollanz's insights into both the period and the content of the manuscript.
__label__1 Boring film: This film seems to me to be very superficial, relying more on cinamatography than fact. It is a conglomerate of black and white, shadowy scenes which, low and behold, just as in The Wizard of Oz, change into color at the appearance of the Blessed Mother. Boring, Boring, Boring!
__label__1 No response: This review isn't for the microscope but for the seller Shopzeus. I wanted to purchase this microscope for my son for Christmas so I placed an order and waited for a response. After two weeks the seller had not confirmed the order, nor had they replied to a follow up e-mail I sent about the purchase. I ended up having to go with a different microscope from another vendor with a steeper shipping charge since Christmas was so near. Thanks for nothing Shopzeus.
__label__2 Alcott is the best: I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now. Then my sister bought this book, and I just found myself intrested in the first page of the book!!!!!Its about 4 sisters Meg, Jo, Beth,and Amy. It warms your heart when the sisters sit together near the fire and read the letter from their father, and when Jo cuts her hair. You laugh when Jo and Laurie meet their 1st time and talks funnily. You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, & especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy. But the sad part, I think is how Jo loves Beth and is ready to give her whole life for Beth. Mr. Bhaer and Jo gets married and .....read LITTLE MEN!!!!!! I LOVE ALL ALCOTT'S BOOK, AND WISH SHE WAS STILL ALIVE!
__label__1 Morrison has a gift for writing beginners witchcraft books: I'm just getting into the Craft, but this book almost got me out of it. It's really boring, simple, and goes over the same old thing again and again. Morrison has a gift for writing beginers witchcraft books. They are fluffy and fun, but I'd prefer reading books that say something about life and has some kind of meaning and message. Morrison would do well to take up writing children's books, but forget about writing more beginner's Wicca books.
__label__1 Disturbing Read: I normally like books about the supernatural, witches, etc. I loved Harry Potter and my kids and I have also enjoyed the witch books by Eva Ibbottson. However, I found this book to be very disturbing.It wasn't the one brother's death that bothered me, or the fact that his twin brother is trying to talk to him one last time. What bothered me was that I felt children were being encouraged to turn to the occult to deal with death.In one of the other reviews, a teacher said she had read the book to her class. If my child had been in her class, I would have been extremely upset. When you write a book about witches for children, there needs to be a sense that this is make-believe. The Magic Hour did not do that.If you get this book for your children, please read it yourself before you give it to them.
__label__1 Nice looking but ...: My six year old son loved the look of the watch and the indiglo, but after a day it stopes working. We promtly got a new one and that also stopped. It's a shame, I remember when a Timex took a licking and kept on ticking. We asked for a refund, went to the mall and purchased a diffrent brand.
__label__2 Frank Gambale at his best..a journey of smooth: In all honesty I'd have to say that Frank's music and styling of Jazz is second to none!since I've come across his music it's filling a gap in my music library and my personal likes.Thanks Frank Gambale for Great Music.
__label__2 I love it so far: UPS brought this heavy package 20 minutes ago. Eventhough I am female, I didn't read the instructions and I have fettucini drying as I write. I can't wait to taste it. It was so simple and fast. The 3 attachments are truly heavy duty.I was looking for a crank type pasta maker when I stumbled accross this "attachment" option. I already own the big, expensive Kitchenaid mixer. Eventhough the attachments are more money than the "crank" things, I opted for this one and am glad that I don't have yet another "appliance" to store like that breadmaker.
__label__2 AWESOME: I have an upscaling dvd player, and the dvd's looked pretty good. but on bluray, Id have to say it looks unbelievable. seems like all the effects dealing with lighting and shadows look way better, also the details like when the scorpion comes out of the sand, the fine sand in the air looks way better. plus there is tons of extra features.
__label__1 don't waste your time...: The good thing I can say is that I didn't buy this book, but checked it out from my library. And now I know that was a waste time. It had a good idea, but I found the 'heroine' not very smart, and it just didn't go into enough detail on any of the subjects that were brought up. It just left you hanging. You are better off not having anything to read, if that was the only book you could get.
__label__1 a waste of time: Don't believe all the five-star reviews, this is yet another book about mind-control, telling yourself to change your thoughts in order to change your life. The exercises are a waste of time, as far as self-help books go, this one is one of the worst I've ever read. Every chapter repeats the same diatribe over and over. Come on, Esther Hicks is channeling spiritual entities that are giving her all this supposed wisdom and information? The Hicks have developed a huge money-making scam.
__label__1 government propaganda packed in a horror story: I thought the story was good, but barely kept back the bile on the unabashed propaganda about the inner workings (and what they do for us average civilians) of the pentagon.
__label__2 Rez blows my mind: I remember driving back to NYC from Boston after seeing Spiritual Rez play, and throwing in the new Rez CD for the first time (the new CD is called Rising in the East, which I can only find in the Amazon auctions section), and I was completely stunned! I had literally never heard anything like it. Amazing!Rez, you're my hero.
__label__1 Can I Buy a Baby, and Can I Send It Back?: In her book, Jana Wolff objectifies the child and dismisses the child's mother as so much garbage. In truth, birth mothers enter into relinquishment sorrowfully and loving their children, and in doing so, they embark on a lifelong journey of pain: missing the child and loving the child and knowing they made a wrong decision in their youth. Jana Wolff's treatment of birth mothers is as they are simply a means of deliverance only (that is her word, deliverance). Wolff also devours and spits up the traditional adoptive family mythology, to be sure, openly discussing that cost indicates buying a baby, and wondering if she can send it back after purchase.Other adoptive parents have lauded this book. I say, if Wolff's representation of how adoptive parents think is reality, a hard look at adoption, motives of adoptive parents, and the welfare of the child vis-a-vis adoption is sorely needed.Thumbs-down on the thinking that is presented throughout this book.
__label__1 Overrated.: I was expecting to be floored by this movie. I wasn't. I suppose that in 1970, the violence and fake blood, gender bending, homosexuality, physical deformity, religious symbolism were big stuff! Shocking! But in reality the film is probably best appreciated by artsy, stoned out movie goers tripping to a midnight movie in 1970. Many people point out that John and yoko were proponents of this film....but then again they could sit in bed for a week at a time. Which would get tedious to most people, which is a good word to describe this movie.
__label__1 Avoid: Never had problems like this with any other phones. Sometimes the phone rings, sometimes it doesn't (the satellite handset never rings; at least it's consistent). Too often, when dialling out, you get a message that says "try again". Now, after only three months and change, some of the lettering on the ID screen is fading out. Not good.
__label__2 Great, but don't buy what's free: This is published by Jehovah's Witnesses for free, and although the audio cassette format is no longer distributed, you can still obtain the audio version of this amazing book for children by asking any of Jehovah's Witnesses to order it for you or downloading from their official website at[...]. In any case, let it be known that it is free.
__label__1 Good title, but what about content....: According to my opinion absolutely useless book - seems that authors just "copy -paste" infomation from different sources. Also I disgaree with other reviewers that book is giving some practical information concerning participation in certian events. Having seen some of the events (places) what authors are describing I consider that information sometimes is misleading. Not to mention format and layout of the book - you really do not want to hold in hands such book, especially about travelling.
__label__1 This CD is way overrated by most: I read a fair sampling of the reviews here and decided to take a chance on this CD because most seem to be solid four and five star reviews. Boy, did I make a mistake!!! There's no way this disc deserves any more than two stars and I'm probably being generous in giving it that. This band is in desperate need of a lead guitar player. The rare attempts at playing anything that remotely resembles a decent lead guitar lick are laughable on this disk. At times they do sound like some of the groups others have mentioned, but never as good as any of them. If this band last for four albums or more I'd be very, very surprised. I just don't hear enough talent on this disc to make me think they can put out more than one or two more CD's before everybody looses interest in them.
__label__1 have not seen it yet: i am still waiting for the dvd to arrive its been 3 weeks and still no parcel please find out on where it isthanks
__label__2 One of the best resources for Biblical study: Have read this book twice. It is masterfully written to be a comprehensive overview study of the Old and New Testaments without getting bogged down in the details. When God's story is told, like it is, in this format the details of scripture begin to take shape. "Drama of Scripture" gives a panoramic view of what God has done and is doing through out the history of mankind. It is a story that when seen in this scope becomes relevant to us today. Have recommended this book to many people in hopes of studying the scriptures using this book as a resource.
__label__2 The Classic Strategy Game: Although graphics are worse than in Civ3, gameplay is far better. That said, all I can do is testify the things you can read in the other posts.If you have an older PC, you're better off with Civ2...
__label__1 Dare to Abuse: This book is about how to abuse children when you are an impatient parent. Children need unconditional love and patience. Children can learn that the parent is ultimately the boss when the parent is patient enough to teach. I once waited for my son for 4 hours because he refused to do as he was told. We would not do it his way, we would do it my way or no way. He learned I could wait for him longer than he could wait for me to give up. That was not the last of his demanding his way, but it never was anywhere near that bad again.Want a quick fix? Use this book. Want a child who doesn't trust? Use this book. Want an excuse to hurt your parents for all the times they hurt you? Use this book.
__label__1 Tuner had major problems: I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed!
__label__1 The world as america: I think that the book is well worthwhile to read but unfortunately is has to be taken with a huge grain of salt. I think that it is very narrowly focused and as an apology for globalism it is both too americanized and one sided. There is more than one (successful) culture in the world.
__label__1 system requirements: Be aware that this does not play on the american systems. I did not see a disclaimer when I bought it! Was very disappointing when we sat down to watch it and it wouldn't play!
__label__2 funny movie: If you are a hunter or fisherman and have a group that you regularly hunt with or fish you will definately enjoy the humor in this movie. Great acting by Daniels.
__label__1 William Hung Sucks!: This Album Sucks! Look, this guy has no talent! Everybody knows that, so why do we praise him for being funny? Nobody should get popular in music if they suck! This guy totally butchers the song "Rocket Man" which is a classic Elton John Song. This guy has no right to do that. I have no respect for him. Who does he think he is? Does he think he can have a musical career with no talent? He should not have a career. So, for the sake of music, don't buy this album! If I could give it 0 stars, I would!
__label__1 Chick Flick: I was ready for a great story in typical Grisham style. What I got was a chick flick. I usually quit a book like this after 90 to 100 pages. I should have this time. However, I kept hoping the story would get better. Save your money and re-read the firm.
__label__1 worst Holmes ever: this set may appear to be a good deal-10 stories on two dvd's at a modest price--but in this case you get what you pay for-not much!A unique thing about this set-Ronald Howard is without a doubt the worst Holmes of all time--and if that's not enough-H. Marion Crawford is the worst Watson of all time--and as a bonus-Archie Duncan appears as the worst Lestrade of all time. Not trying to kick a dead dog--but the acting and portrayals are about as pathetic as you'll find--spend a little more and get some quality versions of Sherlock Holmes!
__label__1 Microsoft Ergonomic Desktop 7000: I've used these keyboards for years and really like them. That said, I may return this one. The keys are very stiff. The space bar is over the top stiff. This isn't exactly ergonomic!
__label__2 works perfectly: Keeps time accurately and doesn't need winding. I skip a day sometimes and it keeps on ticking. Much more comfortable than the expensive one, not too big, not too heavy.
__label__2 Perfect for treadmill runners!!: I put this video in for the 30 minutes or so that I run on the treadmill each day and it inspires me to great things! These are not spoiled, pampered over-paid athletes that compete. They are people like all of us and most of them are well into their 40's and above. Their effort is unbeleivable. The video also has great stories, wonderful photography and fantastic quotes about nature and the environment.
__label__1 Two Words "SUCKED AZZ!!": First of all, why spend $15 dollars on a cd that sucks such as this one. I thought the movie was awesome with all the dance moves so you can kinda figure that the soundtrack would be awesome too. "WRONG", the soundtrack sucked and there was no battle songs. Here is a list of some of the battle songs. Got Bless imesh!DMX-get on the floorTimbaland and Magoo-dropNas-HeavenRedman-time for some actionHopefully this is not a money scheme trying to get people to buy two cds. They wonder why people file share. With cd's such as this, it makes perfect sense.
__label__1 Stupid: I tolded my mom to buy me this and it is the most boring thing ever!!! DONT BUY IT!!!!!! First The Ear Listener Is cheesy. If you Take it out your ear you can here the same thing. The Motion detector only goes off if someone touches the lens. But Who would do that. The Telescope is okay. The Voice changer is cool though. I would only Buy a voice changer if you could. YOU WILL HATE YOURSELF IF YOU BUY THIS TOY.
__label__2 not as scary to set up as I thought: the directions embedded in these reviews were quite helpful, and the one time I needed to call AT&T they seemed to be familier with this product. I haven't had any problems with it cutting out and it's been fast as I could expect
__label__2 You get used to it: Rose is kind of tired of being seen as just a maid. Her sister, Norah, has just been fired from her waitress job. Rose's married boyfriend, a cop, assures her that her skills are useful - cleaning crime scenes pays well. Talking Norah into joining her the two start a business doing just that. It's not easy or fun, but Rose is proud of her work, still managing Norah, raising a son, dealing with dad, being the other woman? It's not such an easy life to live. Can any of them really handle it?It did feel like there could have been a little more done with this movie, still over all a good movie.
__label__2 Great product: This is the second set of Air Lifts I have installed on a Class A motor home. While the instructions are good, putting them into practice isn't quite so easy. I was able to roll them as instructed. When I inserted them they went pretty easily to the mid-point, where there is a ridge and this caused me problems for whatever the reason. Bu twisting, I eventually was able to get the bag all the way up. It is amazing how good they are and what support they can provide.
__label__2 ... And I'm not much for your average PG rated flick.: Usually I dont watch little kids movies, or movies aimed at kids, but this, & certain other ones seem to get me to like them(examples: Shrek 2, The Harry Potters, this, nightmare before christmas), Any way this is a classic, and most of my movies are 90s, & today flicks, but for some reason this film is just a good movie, I don't know how there going to make a remake either, because this one is close to perfect for its type of film. Reccomended
__label__1 Is this for real? I just don't understand the appeal.: I got pointed to this song when I signed on one day, and I thought it was a joke. Since I wasn't quite sure, I clicked on a link to find a sample of the song, and a description of the "artist", if I can even call her that. The song isn't a joke! I couldn't believe it! I can't imagine that this song was written for any other purpose except to advertise AIM. In fact, her entire website (it's like a car wreck, you just can't keep your eyes away) is one big marketing plot for it. An advertising jingle? Fine. But a song? A song people can actually *buy*? A song this girl is going on tour for? Where do people see the merit in it?
__label__2 awesome prices!!: My son is 11 and as any parent knows it is hard to buy for an 11 year old. He loves the basketball hoop by Nerf as it looks really cool glowing in the dark. Bought the item for $7.50, totally unbeatable prices with free shipping included at Christmas time. The best deals out there!!!
__label__2 jack pot!!: i didn't know how i would remove the scuff marks from the rim of my bathtub and the stains in my tub. i tried everything. so when someone from my job mentioned this product, i thought i'd give it a try. it works.....i am very pelased. will order this product again and again. thanks
__label__1 Didn't Cut: Was very disappointed in this product. Got a tip from a blogger that this would cut like butter through metal scrapbooking dies....it didn't!!!!
__label__2 Gone for ever...?: Wonderfully evocative of times past; even if they were only in the imagination!Palin is quite brilliant in his portrayals and we can easily understand what it was that made Britain great!!!! Roger of the Raj deserves special mention; a truly masterly depiction of life in the British Army of the time. Were there really such 'firm buttocked young Amazons'?Great.
__label__1 Not enough pink pegs!: I would avoid this packet unless you already have about 60 pink pegs and 30 violet pegs. We had the pegs from the Lite Brite, plus the pegs from this packet, PLUS a 100 peg refill and the pegs from another packet (Littlest Pet Shop). We still had to use orange to complete it. Best to avoid.
__label__2 No complaints: Works as expected. I wish the handles would extend a little bit more. I am 6'2". Still, this is the tallest walker I was able to find. The color is stated as royal blue but it looks a little purple to me. I am quite satisfied.
__label__2 Think you know Sound?: If you think you know sound, you don't know jack 'til you read this book. I was completely suprized how much I thought I knew about effects and proccessing Now I am sure I know a whole lot more. Just wish there were more diagrams and pictures.
__label__2 Excellent Product: This produc worked great. It greatly cut down the time needed for hinge prep. Make sure to order the proper bit for the job!
__label__2 FAREWELL, FACES: The testament of Face to Face musical career is a sad operetta with several documentals and videos. In the top of these 2 DVD's remains the last Face to Face concert, performed at the House of Blues: a lively half and hour that goes through the early years to 2002's How to ruin everything. One of the best punk bands in years.
__label__1 Bootleg, don't buy: It's a Chinese bootleg that used TV-cap as the video source. You can see the SBS broadcast logo in the right-hand corner, and there is Korean news text scrolling at the bottom. The English subtitles aren't good either. Avoid...
__label__1 Nothing Special: Decent basic skirt if you like a little bit dowdy with shiny fabric. True to size is about the best I can say.
__label__1 A Trip into Fantasy Land: This book claims to be an accurate presentation of the "Okinawan Diet," but the elements of that supposed diet are a far cry from reality. I live in Hawaii where there is a large Okinawan community (including first, second, third, etc., generations) and I have many friends who were raised in Okinawa. Believe me: Their diet is anything but "low-fat" as this book claims.Okinawans are known for their preference for fatty pork and they principally use lard in their cooking--nothing low fat here I can assure you. They do eat vegetables, rice, fish, and those delicious purple potatoes, but the mainstay of Okinawan cuisine is pork.This book is simply a politically correct re-writing of the actual evidence done by the Spin Doctors of modern nutrition. You're better off getting Fallon & Enig's book "Nourishing Traditions," or Allan and Lutz' book "Life Without Bread."CAVEAT EMPTOR!
__label__2 Great Resource: I read this book back in the mid 80's. Had a big impact on my life growing up as a child of a severe alcoholic father. This book help me build a new road to a better life of restoration! Highly reccommend seller and even more the book.
__label__2 Gutsy pilots, tough dames, classic pulp fiction: Men seemed tougher in the 1930s than today--at least it sounds like it. I guess the lure of adventure was stronger and more accessible, especially with aviation still being in its infancy and no doubt very dangerous by current standards. Sabotage is the Sky not only has tough guys fighting it out on land and in the sky, but a great, cocky female pilot who more than pulls her weight to save the day.The basic plotline revolves around Bill Trevillian, who tests new fighter planes for the Allied Forces. He's competing with another company to get a multi-million dollar aircraft contract. Covert Nazi enemy agents, however, have tampered with the warbird to deliberately mark it for failure, and fatalities. While campy in some parts, it has so much action, that like an Indiana Jones flick, it makes it more fun.
__label__1 South Park - The Passion of the Jew: Never got the dvd but see it on south park. It a great show if you like south parkMike
__label__2 DEWALT SAFETY GLASSES W 2.5 READER: Glasses arrived quickly and in good condition. I was surprised the bows on the glasses are NOT adjustable as they are on many other safety glasses. The protective sleeve is open on both ends and very tight. It is so tight I am not using it. Very difficult to slide glasses into the sleeve, I almost feel like I'll break the glasses or scratch the lens. The optical clarity of the 2.5 reader is very good. The glasses fit my head just fine and are comfortable. I would buy these again.
__label__1 SO small: This set is ridiculously small. We do not have one piece of food that would fit in the pots and the utensils are miniature.
__label__1 DISSAPOINTED ALSO: I WANTED TO USE THIS AT LOCAL SKATING RINK ON NEW YEARS EVE - AND MAYBE ABLE TO SELL MORE AS I GOT THIS IN SHOP ALSO - WELL I PUT IT IN [[ AFTER READING ALL DIRECTIONS ]]GEE...... IN COMPLETE DARKNESS THERE WAS A SLIGHT BLUE GLOW - BUT AT THE RINK --- NO ONE NOTICED IT AT ALL...EVEN UNDER DISCO AND UB LIGHTS --I PUT IT ON AT 8:00 PM ---- ALLOWED TIME TO REACH FULL GLOW....WAS SKATING MOST OF THE NIGHT -- WITH TOWEL TRYING TO KEEP IT OUT OF MY EYES -- SINCE THE SWEAT WAS ON FOREHEAD ....WELL I GOT BACK AND WASHED IT OUT OF MY HAIR AT 12:30 PM NEW YEARS EVE...WASTE OF MONEY...... JUST WISH I WAS ABLE TO RETURN THE OTHER 7 COLORS I GOT ROPEED IN TO BUYING ......
__label__2 Love it, love it, love it!: I've been using the original EA Sports Active and the free iPod app "Lose It!" to exercise and diet since last August - about 4 months ago. Between the two, I've lost 30 pounds, 5% body fat, and 4 inches off my waist while building a lot of muscle. I got "More Workouts" for Christmas and started a new 6 week challenge the next day. Despite the progress I'd made with the first version, the new exercises are hard! I'm feeling the results in muscles I never knew I had, and after only a week and a half I can already already see visible changes.My favorite feature is that there's a whole, planned workout each day. I know myself, and if I'm left to make up my own routine, I'll lose motivation and abandon it. I get a lot of benefit from having a set schedule to follow.
__label__2 Kewl CD Single: I think this is a really good single. I have it for myself. My mom got it for me for X-Mas and I just couldn't keep the song "If You Knew What I Knew" off repeat! This song shows great talent that AJ McLean has. As well as the rest of the boys. This is a real soulful ballad and is worth getting. Track one is also good cause the music is just like the video and track two is pretty awesome especially if you like songs that are eight minutes long.
__label__2 Elf is a classic: This movie is a family favorite. I've found my young teenager watching it throughout the year. This is the type of movie that has you quoting it and wanting to watch it over and over.
__label__1 Poor Quality: This item lasted about a week before the screen over one earbud fell off. A couple weeks after that, most of the paint marking the left and right earbuds had already flaked off. These are what you pay for - cheap headphones, cheap quality. Steer clear.
__label__1 Does not fit the EX V6 Accord: I bought this to resolve my SRS light issue. First problem: clock spring arrived with a broken alignment tab, which Amazon resolved quickly. Second problem: wiring harness is missing a wire that is needed for the steering wheel radio controls. I checked Dorman's website and this is the only clock spring/cable reel listed for my 99 Accord EX V6 sedan.
__label__2 Hilarious: Typical English comedy: random and unpredictable, but intelligent and well-timed. The three leads interact well and the supporting cast features short appearances by some great English comedians. Combines a bit of Dilbert office humor with dork jokes and the hilarious pathos of a normal "career-minded" woman trying to make something of her department of two misfits.

__label__2 What a diamond ........: This book is right on the spot for me at this time of this life ......Gangaji beautifully reflects all the questions of the truth-searching mind, and opens a mindblowing doorway to the real truth. She points to the possibility of releasing the mind of the impossible task of finding the real truth for you. It is already there, you are IT already and the real challenge is to relax into the fact that you already are real truth, wether you are aware of it or not.Gangaji says that it is great to be aware of emotions, reactions, thoughts etc. But don't overlook awareness itself! Because that's what you are. So incredibly simple.....Just read it and let yourself be penetrated by her loving arrows of truth!!
__label__1 Useless - really disappointed.: We purchased these batteries with the charger confident in the name brand and the customer reviews. What a joke. The batteries lack the needed voltage (even fully charged) to run ANY of our devices. Regular AA batteries are 1.5 volts, these are 1.2 volts. They don't have enough power to run our Flip video camera, Vtech children's camera, or any of my sons baby toys...they are basically useless to us. We have yet to find a single device that these will run. VERY DISAPPOINTED...I've never been so disgusted in a SONY product.WARNING TO ALL RECHARGABLE BATTERY BUYERS - CHECK THE VOLAGE OF THE BATTERY YOU PURCHASE OR YOU MAY BE STUCK WITH USELESS BATTERIES AS WELL. Not even the Eneloop batteries are "strong" enough - they too are 1.2 volt. Until rechargables are the same voltage as disposable - I guess I am stuck with being wasteful in order to run my battery-operated devices.
__label__1 Do not waste your money: If you buy this gear for travelling, do not expect it to cut out the jet engine noise when not listening to audio - as passive headphones go you would be better off buying a set of ear muffs. These headphones are well made and the voice through mode is quite good. A clip to hang on your belt would be useful as they are quite bulky.
__label__2 Excellent Primer!: This should be on every techie's bookshelf! Much better than the info in those $195 "get rich quick" mailings, for a lot less. If you are interested in learning technical basics, at a bargain price, this is the place to start. You will find yourself reviewing it over and over.
__label__1 Too Adult for a Young Audience: This is a well written book. On the other hand, this book is not suitable for my young adult(13-16) age group. The biggest reason is that the author turned one of the characters into a lesbian. The sexuality content is far too prolific for a young audience. As are some of the issues dealt with throughout the story. I do not recommend this book for someone under the age of 17.
__label__1 Tis--Trash: What a major disappointment. I could not believe this was the work of the same author of Angela's Ashes. I could find no portion of this book where one would not have to wade through the gutters of New York, all due to the filthy language that is so very distracting. How sad that such a brillian man and author would have to stoop to such rot to sell a book. Not only have I lost all respect for him as a writer, but as a gentleman as well. I will be returning it as quickly as I am well enough to go to the post office.
__label__1 Works well as a cleanser, but smells HORRIBLE: I love all four of the other Wen cleansing conditioners. I alternate between them because using just one tends to make my hair feel a bit weighed-down after a couple of cleansings. I bought the set of five because I thought I'd like to add Fig to the lineup.UGH. Imagine this: You are eating a Fig Newton. At first it tastes like scruptious figs. Then you realize that someone has injected menthol flavor into the middle of it. If this sounds like it would taste and smell horrible, you're right.Fig Cleansing Conditioner smells like delicious figs, plus menthol. EW. I had to wash with the Lavender flavor to get the smell out! Two thumbs down on this one, Chaz Dean.I gave it two stars instead of one because it's a good cleanser, minus the smell.
__label__2 Good Deal: Got this item shipped very fast. Works as advertised but the instructions say it is "water resistant" not water proof as listed in the ad. The batteries it uses are a little expensive. Overall very happy with this item
__label__2 I can have a: I have waited so long for this DVD to be released. It's finally going to happen and I am elated. When I logged onto (....)and saw it, I screamed and I probably could've jumped out of my skin. That's how happy I am. This is one of the best TV shows still on. I am often late to work because I've stayed up watching reruns at 11 and 11:30. Now, I'll be able to watch whenever I want. I was just about to write a letter to the CW, too. This is the best Black History Month present ever!
__label__2 Get this: This is by far the best cd boosie has put out. All the songs on this cd are hits. That "Bad Azz" cd is also about to drop and that Should be even better. So if you don't have this cd yet, you need to get it.
__label__1 Dissapointed: I thought this would be a nice set, because Kitchenaid is always such a reliable brand, but I was wrong. The quality is okay they seemed nice at first but like everyone else said the paint and telfon started chipping fairly quickly. Not worth the money. I will go with something else next time.
__label__1 Not Impressed: A friend of mine bought this book and wanted to read it to my son. I read the book first and my initial impression was negative. However, I let my friend go ahead and read it. My son liked it, but he also enthusiasticaly took on the 'Spinky' attitude and began to sulk after the slightest rebuke from anyone. Spinky is negative, selfcentered, and unforgiving. He pessimistically finds ulterior motives for others acts of kindness toward him. His last minute realisation that the folks aren't all bad, at least they're trying, so I guess I'll forgive them afterall, doesn't negate his negative character that is built up in the first three quarters of the book. Kids will pick up on his basic character, not his one act of forgiveness at the end.
__label__2 One yearold loves it!: We purchased this tent for our son's first birthday. It is small enough to set up in the house without taking up too much space. The colors are great and it has lasted through our son hanging on the walls. We have not let him touch the zippers, they seem a little flimsy.
__label__2 glad a book can change SOMETHING in history!: Upton Sinclair writes a touching book, explaining what labor was like at the turn of the century. Oh, and to "AP History Student from Colorado", it's not about writing better endings. (i admit i skimmed over this part too... but) Sinclair is simply expressing his views about socialism being the solution to these labor problems. now if you'll excuse me, i must write an essay dealing with this wonderful novel.
__label__2 THE THE - NAKED SELF: As with previous THE THE albumns, Naked Self must be listened to repeatedly before the true genius of Matt Johnson is revealed. The overall sound has changed considerably from previous releases - mainly the lack of piano, keyboard, harmonica, and sampling. Some THE THE fans will be disappointed by this. Although I miss the diversity of sound that I am accustomed to, NakedSelf manages to maintain complexity in its songs with the guitar and guitar effects. Perhaps it is the 7 years of expectation, but NakedSelf left me wanting more. I found Voidy Numbness a bit simple, and Salt Water too loud. Swine Fever and Global Eyes are the only songs on the album that are "in your face" political. Mind Bomb fans will like these songs in particular as did I. The rest of the songs carried the album for me especially Boiling Point which I consider to be pure and timeless THE THE.
__label__1 plain rubbish.....: i was really disappointed reading this book- the dialogues were corny, giving useless information (and in a rather stupid maner, might i add), un-explained actions which only seemed to serve the plot, and a general feeling that the author has read too many pulp fiction and cloak and dagger books, and REALLY wanted to write one, too. the lines are so over dramatic, that you can actually envision the scene ending with a soap-opera close-up.absolutely terrible....avoid at all cost!!
__label__1 Needed more............: dAmn what's the deal we'll there is none.... if U are a fan of Pat you already have these songs and if you're not than U probably wouldn't buy it anyway he just don't write no more he's has smoked himself stupid and can no longer deliver on a consistent basis next album will probably be in 2010............. dAmn .............what a waist of talent...hah ha smOking will ruin your life GLAD I stopped..........
__label__2 Camera Shy...: Mark (Carl Boehm) is a socially-awkward young man. He's a quiet, seemingly innocent film-maker who is more boy than man. No one would ever suspect that Mark has a problem, well, many deep-seated problems. No one would ever suspect him as a murderer. Mark, like Norman Bates, is so mild-mannered as to float right below the radar. There is no suspicion of him as the perpetrator of a series of grisly homicides. PEEPING TOM is the story of a father's twisted experiments on his own son, and the resulting psychopathy in the offspring. Very disturbing for its time (1960), TOM takes a voyeuristic filming approach, involving the viewer in Marc's crimes. While not so shocking today, it still manages to pose some questions about the relationship between movies and their audience. Highly recommended...
__label__1 Really really boring: This book provides a bunch of politically motivated exerpts that provide nothing more than endless boredom.
__label__1 In Praise of Economic Illiteracy: In voluntary economic transactions one person's gain is always another's loss. That is the lesson of Maude Barlow. It's a compelling argument until you think about a bit. If a foreign company sells goods in Canada at a price lower than that of Canada firms, Barlow would have you believe that all Canadians are worse off. After all, the competition is destroying Canadian jobs. However, while there may be job losses, all Canadian benefit from the lower prices of the imports, allowing us to purchase more goods.Would the world be better off if the government required all buildings to board up all their windows? After all, the sun "unfairly" competes with the producers of lightbulbs and candles, thus requiring all windows to be boarded up would stimulate these industries. Within Barlow's, and others, such as Linda McQuiag, this is a logical premise. Go read Frederic Bastiat before reading Barlow's book, in simple language he shatters all of her arguments.
__label__2 Natural and works with your body...: Excellent product. Had knee surgery and helped with the swelling, naturally... It actually promotes normal cardiovascular and Joint Function. I was looking for something that was herbal and Zyflamend met my expectations.
__label__1 JBL Headphone (not good): I found that the quality of this headphone to be worse than the set that came with my ipod. In order to get quality bass it had to be inserted far into the ear, and during physical activity (working out at the gym) it constantly became dislodged, causing the sound to be very tinny.
__label__2 Classic Pioneer: One of the best pictures Robert Redford has made. Far better than "Dances with Wolfs" about telling the story of the pain for both pioneers and indians when America was growing after the Civil War. Redford becomes a mountain man after being taken under the wing of Will Geer. A little comedy but overall a drama that shows the hardships of the times. Great supporting cast and direction, excellent locations, and good music make this well worth seeing. The price is very reasonable and the DVD is well worth owning.
__label__2 Funny fast read: I was looking forward to reading "Watermelon" as I have been in a similar situation to Claire myself. I found it to be a really good light (but not trashy) read. The book is written as if Claire is talking to you, which means you really identify with her and all her insecurities. It was great when Claire realized that she was fine just the way she was and that she didn't need anyone in her life who couldn't accept that. Claire's family were excellent secondary characters, I can't wait to read "Rachel's Holiday" to hear more about them. Adam seemed a bit too good to be true, or maybe I'm just looking in the wrong places! The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have also read "Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married" and it had quite a lot more plot and was heaps longer than "Watermelon". Marian Keyes' books are so enjoyable to read, it's disappointing to have them end as quickly as "Watermelon" did.
__label__2 Beyond gorgeous!: Novica brings us another fabulous artist, as this necklace is beyond gorgeous. If you look closely at the picture you'll see the butterfly bends slightly down from the coil collar. This detail makes the necklace arch beautifully over the base of the throat rather than laying completely flat...it is difficult to explain other than to say the necklace "sticks up" a bit at the throat, giving it an elegant, 3D effect. I love the mixed colors of all the stones, and though the silver-work appears fragile, it is quite sturdy. The coil collar is covered in super-sparkly brown glass beads (coils are great as you don't have to mess with clasps, yet they remain firmly in place). The stones of the butterfly are smooth and give more of a subtle sheen. It is both a delicate piece and a knock-out piece at the same time. LOVE it!
__label__2 Did the trick!: We received a truck with an Alpine stereo recently installed. We got this cable so we can plug the iPod into it. Works great.
__label__2 best sports bra ever: I am a 38D equestrian that has always had "bounce" problems. This bra is the answer. No bounce, ever. Not pretty, not easy to get into and out of, but NO BOUNCE EVER. I'll buy more when I need them.
__label__1 worked okfor awhile: I bought this warmer because it was able to warm disposable liners. I could never get the right temperature it was either too hot or too cold and if it was too cold you couldn't reheat for another 5 or 10 mins. Explain that to a hungary 4 week old. It did finally break at 6 wks. I found that hot tap water was the best way after all. It gets the bottle just right in no time. I'm a new mother so i wanted every gadgit out there but it seems the old way is best for me.
__label__1 "IF I WANTED A BOOTLEG I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE! ": I love Zeke but 90% of this disc sounds like s**t!
__label__1 Simply Terrible: Mr. Newman plays with the accuracy and passion of a machine. This recording is truly lifeless. At the very least, he plays way too fast as so the listeners ears are only assaulted briefly.
__label__2 Furtwängler.Greatest of all conductors .: This is perhaps the greatest Wagner recording of all time. Furtwängler's conception is un such an exalted plane , that it seems to enter a cosmos hidden to most others. Just to listen to the third act , and how he brings Suthaus and the orchestra with him , is an experience impossible to explain.
__label__1 Not as good as advertised.: In theory, this is a good idea but, in reality, it's a waste of $40. It doesn't stay on unless you strap it so tight it cuts off your circulation. If it were in two pieces it might be more functional.
__label__1 Torture Device: These were a mistake! They are the most uncomfortable headphones ever! I can't really tell you how they sound because I took them of my head in 15 minutes (well, they did sound better than my $20 Sony headphones)and had them ready to ship back a few minutes afterwards. Thank goodness Amazon has a no-nonsense return policy. They might work for some young hip-hop DJ who only needs to hold one cup up to his ear to make sure his noise-makers are still plugged in. However, they will be disappointing to anyone trying to use them in a studio or audiophile situation.
__label__2 Great toy, frequently used: Purchased this toy from a local pet store. Great buy. Our kitten loves to play with the toy and she uses the scratch pad in the middle fairly frequently. It's the perfect toy to keep her occupied when she is by herself. It also provides her good exercise, as she likes to get the ball with a running attack. She has not lost interest after a month and a half. We had to remove the toy from the bedroom because the sound of the ball rolling in the track would wake us up at 3AM. Most valuable cat toy so far.
__label__1 $20.00 down the drain: After forcing myself to watch the entire movie, I would have felt better just setting a twenty dollar bill on fire. I guess Vil Kilmer was short on beer money to have his name and face on this movie. Just goes to show you read the reveiws first.
__label__2 Ten Thousand Fists, THE Rock album of 2005.: When Disturbed released their first album "The Sickness" in 2000, Didn't think it would be possible for them to get any better. Then in 2002, They blew my mind again with Believe, a more melodic album. Here in 2005, with Ten Thousand Fists, they have done it again. Easily the best Rock album of 2005. No filler tracks, every song rocks with the power of Ten Thousand Fists!
__label__1 WHITE MEN CAN JUMP BUT THEY SURE CANT RAP: This is, without a doubt, the worst cd ever. Eminem's voice is incredibly annoying, his lyrics are horrible, and the beats are wack. Also his video for "My name is..." is the absolute worst music video I have ever seen. Eminem is everywhere now and I dont see why. Save your $ everyone...Get a cd that is NOT a disgrace to rap or hip hop.(i.e. 2pac, Wutang, etc.) Dont buy this "cd" cuz u think its funny. Dont buy this cd for any reason. The last thing the world needed was another Vanilla Ice, and, I'm sorry 2 say, we got one. This cd does not deserve a tip of a star.
__label__2 Good SciFi: Watched the series on prime and enjoyed it. Acting is good and the CGI on the sci fi stuff is great
__label__1 Boring trivia: I am a collector of memoirs of the French Revolution and 1st Empire and hope to use them to rewrite and complement the regimental histories that already exist. Unfortunately, many of these memoirs are vague and picturesque, but none of them are as rambling, disjointed and peppered with idiotic and inconsequential dialogues as this one. Blaze's banter and anecdotes often refer to periods prior to 1789. In all of Blaze's book there is only one interesting uniform detail: Captains and higher grades of the Young Guard flanker regiments wore their former blue Old Guard uniforms while the lower grades wore green.
__label__2 A real "steal": I loved this book. It was easy to read and a technical as you wanted it to be. Wang was unafraid to strike head on many of the nations problems without fear. I use this book as a reference all the time. I would strongly suggest this book to anyone interested in computers or computer security/privacy.
__label__1 first time author, rushing book to market....: I've been using the 'exam cram' series for over three years... and yeah some titles are better than others, but this one makes me so upset I had to write a review (first time). Basic English comprehension should be a requirement for a person to be published... Maybe it's just me but what would you derive for this sentence... chapter 2, page 18... "How the firewall ultimately handles data is based on the firewall's ability to properly handle the data." Picky... maybe, but I just received this book and I love the premise of the 'exam cram's, 'just the facts baby', but it seems to me that the quality of their books is deteriorating. I just passed my CCIE written and that `exam cram' was a joke, very very poor, hence a 'second addition' June 2002. Maybe Mr. Piltzecker needs to start on the second addition of this book.
__label__2 The only pen I buy!: I love this pen; it's the only one I buy. Problem is, it's very hard to find. Recently I've only been able to buy it here on Amazon, and I've noticed that the price keeps rising. Now $70! Ugh!The pen's many good features include its very nice clip. Wonderfully designed with a fused ballbearing that makes it gentle on fabric. The grip is also very nice, although it has a peculiar habit of occasionally becoming mishapen. But I've generally been able to remedy that when necessary.Overall, this is the pen for me. Once in a while when someone asks if I have a pen I can use, and I hand them mine, I hear people rave about how much they like it -- and don't want to return it to me!
__label__1 "I Just Could Not Get Into It.": I got up to around 100 pages before I put this book down. The premise sounded good and I liked the potential conflict with the Soviets over the strange asteroid that settled in Earth orbit. But the tour through the Stone and the explanations of its features seemed very matter-of-fact and failed to hook me. Some of the characters were a bit stiff. I would have liked to have seen more inner reaction about all the Stone's wonders from the main character, Patricia.
__label__2 The Journal of the Death of a Loved one.: We watch a sixteen-seventeen year-old child fight cancer to his own death, but we learn to love the child and the family, and hopefully learn how to make our lives and our loves better by this reading.
__label__1 This CD will break your PC: Don't play this CD on your PC, it does something that screws up the operating system. I had to re-install Windows :-(
__label__2 What is that?: I love this Series, it's absolutely Fantastic, I would encourage anyone that's into Crime Shows to get this Series. I love it.
__label__1 Wrong title and fails to focus on a target audience: I don't know why they called it PL/SQL 101, given that only 2 out of 11 chapters actually are about or even mentions PL/SQL. What it actually is is a brief introduction to databases, Oracle 10g, and brief explanations of various parts of that.It starts out with explaining what a database and a spreadsheet is, and then goes on to try to teach you a bit about everything in only a few pages. If Iwould have to guess, the target audience for this book would have to be not too technical management, to establish a brief understanding of what Oracle is so that they can actually talk with the database administrators. Still it sometimes delves into technical details that is of no use to thataudience.For people who actually know what Oracle is (and are likely buyers of a title like this), it is mostly a waste of time.Still giving it 2 stars, since most people reading this book would probably at least pick up one or two things they didn't know...
__label__2 Worth Reading: I have discovered the Blaze Series is much more "daring" than other Harlequin Romances and while this book is definitely that....it did lack "heat". It's a great story line and still absorbs the reader but I couldn't help but want for more. Interesting connections between characters and enjoyed how they developed but didn't keep me turning pages with anticipation.Worth the read and hopefully can find it on sale!
__label__1 same old same old: This book has the same old information you have already heard. I really did not like this book. It had several items that are false in it, like gorillas eat meat, which they do not. It has lots of negative information on various foods but offers no suggestions on where to buy an alternative product. I just do not see the point of adding this book to your library or collection. No new information whatsoever.
__label__1 Poor guarantee: The rotary grater works very well and easy to clean. The black knob on the handle broke off. I have also heard this happening to two other people. No replacement handle is avaiable. The whole grater must be sent in for a replacement. This is a hassle when it should not be a problem for them to simply send a new handle.
__label__2 An Ambitious And Fun Creature Feature!: Just when you think 'originality' and 'just plain fun' are not in the cards for low budget sci fi/horror, along comes a film like this. An incredible little movie that restores your faith, and reminds you of why you love genre films in the first place. Highly recommended!
__label__2 Hot looking: need to break-in: I purchased the zebra print and the skulls in this shoe. They run small so order 1/2 up. Additionally, the canvas is tight and was uncomfortable at first. I almost sent them back. However, they break-in pretty fast as they strech for your foot. The look of the shoe is great. I get a lot of compliments on them.
__label__2 how to make it better: I really enjoy the product i bought but....when i recieved it in the mail it did not have the outlet power adapters or oweners manuel. also i am in the military so this works great for me and running but on the GPS Side it gives one option for grids not a military option for grids which dont help me. but over all a good product thanks.
__label__2 A stunning book about the human spirit: This book is stunning. It is the tale of a woman who get's raped, and then has to learn to continue living. She and her partner (another woman) travel the land reading hearts. She can only draw what she sees in somebody's heart, and her partner can only interpret the drawings. In order to do this they have to have complete trust in each other, a bond that joins them body, spirit and soul. When this bond is threatened, the entire future of the country's monarchy could be in danger...
__label__1 kind of works: Locks up my intel mac pro running snow leopard instantly every time it is plugged in or out. Wedged hard such that the machine is not even reachable by network for a clean restart. Must be hard reset by power-off. Save all documents, and be prepared for instant death when you bring this unit anywhere near your computer.If you enjoy living dangerously and are planning to install this on a mac, be sure to shutdown your machine first, plug in the device, then reboot. Given that, it seems to work.Also, comes packaged in the worst kind of blister pack that requires great care to open without tremendous risk to life and limb.If there were any viable alternative, I would investigate it seriously. Have to say, while the details may differ, this is pretty typical of the level of quality delivered by anything I have gotten from Belkin in many years.I'll give it two stars because, if you are desperate, and very, very careful, it can be made to work, and you may still have all your fingers.
__label__2 Good but not great.: I used this on top of the OPI Spiderman color 'My Boyfriend Scales Walls' , if the shatter dries properly it looks really great on top of the white polish. The only problem is it goes on slightly clumpy, so you have to be really careful how much of it you apply. And it doesn't dry that great either, so if you do put a little too much on it just takes that much longer to set. I'm not sure if I would purchase it again, I can't decide if it's worth the time you have to invest just to get your nails to look interesting.
__label__1 Beware! This card may not work in your computer!: Had this card for a year and some but didn't use it much. Had occasional freezes of the computer, but didn't think it was the card.Got a wireless router as a present - and this card froze the computer multiple times. New drivers, different drivers, problems installing/uninstalling drivers, cleaning computer, reinistalling, calling tech support via email, then phone - nothing worked. Still get freezes.Netgear forums are full to the neck with tales of how this card, and other similar Netgear cards, freeze computers left, right, and center. Netgear has no response, period. Tech support has fishy tale about how a computer with too many functions on one interrupt can hang driver - but, after all this trouble, putting Linksys adapter in this computer worked as a solution with no problem.Stay away from this card, really.
__label__2 Amazing: I'm so glad they remade the series to follow the manga, it is SO much better all the way through. Although part four is when things really start to get dicey. Every episode is amazing - I can't stress this enough, seriously
__label__1 Blu ray?: The quality looks like it's been downloaded and burned onto a disc. It's definitely not a blu ray. Scam? I'm not sure. But won't buy from this seller again.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money: Unless you intend to use this in your kitchen or in another area where you spend a lot of time don't waste your money. Alarm is far too quiet to ever hear if your freezer is located in a room which you are not in when the alarm sounds such in your basement or garage. My cell phone, microwave etc. alarms are MUCH MUCH louder. In addition the alarm is not continuous. It sounds for only a few seconds every 60 seconds. This may be useful as a thermometer but NOT as an alarm. Wish I had read the reviews complaining about the low volume on this product before I purchased it.
__label__2 gift for a friend: the product came fast. it was for a gift for a friend. I couldn't find it in stores so I was glad it was available for a good price.
__label__2 Twelve Days (The McRae's, Book 1, Sam and Rachel): I really enjoyed this book. It is a story of love, loss, and trials. It certainly made me want to read the other books in the McRae series
__label__1 These arguments were slain by Peter Kreeft already.: Go and read select chapters from Peter Kreeft's 'Handbook of Christian Apologetics', as the questions arise from this book.You will find that Kreeft's book demolishes every claim this book has to offer. There are many books on Christian apologetics, some by not-so-literate writers, and many which this book by Baker would sufficiently question and perplex. But honestly. Take a look at Kreeft's Handbook and you'll find Dan Barker is out of his league. The problem with him seems to be that he has personal issues (clearly shown by his bio) which prevent him from researching these questions to the intellectual limits.
__label__2 This book should be used in the US and not Varney's: This is the best midwife book ever. It far surpasses the USA textbook "Varney's Midwifery" which is a cumbersome monster. This book is easier to read, easier to understand and better organized for information than Varneys. Plus, it is cheaper and it is available on Kindle!
__label__2 Good introduction to a Great Man: As other reviewers note, Marshall was one of the greatest men of the 20th century and a model of what our leaders should be. The author does not engage in hagiography, but instead provides a concise view of this man's life in its historical context. Unfortunately, I was hoping for something more comprehensive, yet not as massive as Pogue's exhaustive (exhausting) work.Stoller does a good job of describing the footprint that Marshall left upon the world, but not enough about him as a man.
__label__1 john REVOLT-A: Why was John Travolta cast in this part? He's "the elephant in the room", and it's not just the fat suit. What a pathetic job of acting, or rather lack of acting.
__label__2 Easy to assemble, great size choices, super fast delivery: WOW! that came fast-- I got it in less than 24 hours of ordering it! Really easy to put together, great piece, will be very functional. Very sturdy. Haven't used it yet, but my gut feeling is this was well made and the other reviews tell me I'm right. The wheels are great; it rolls when you want it to and doesn't when you don't. Love the fact that you can expand it's length and contract it. Only complaint: directions mention a wire grid for use as a shelf on the bottom, but I found no such piece in my package. But, the description also never claimed that it would come with said wire grid, so I have no cause for complaint. Overall, very recommended, worth the money.
__label__1 Great while it lasts!: The good:One button touch and you are done.It sprays the entire shower and keeps it clean.The not so good:Strong chemical smell.Can not be refilled with other less noxios product/requires purchase specific refills.Out first one stopped working after one month. The second one stopped working after two and a half months.Will not be buying a third one.
__label__2 Megan's Mark: This was the first Lora Leigh book that I read and prompted me to start buying, and keeping, her books. Fast paced, very sexy and romantic. I find the concept of Lora Leigh's Breeds fascinating. It's a keeper!
__label__2 Great Headset: I use this head set in Iraq to call my wife. This head set has wonderful sound quality and is very comfortable. We generaly have long conversations over the internet. The quality and function of this head set makes it a great value.
__label__2 Very Easy to Use: At work, I needed to occasionally switch between two computers and was unplugging and re-plugging in the monitor, mouse, and keyboard every time, so I was very happy to find this little gadget! I followed the directions, and it took me about 20 minutes to plug everything into the switch. Ever since then, it has worked perfectly each time I have needed it in the 6 months I have used it. I was a little surprised about how short the cables were, but since my computers are right next to each other and there's a keyboard shortcut to actually switch between them, the shortness has not been a problem.
__label__2 Working well after many years: I got this for my picky father. He's still using it after 5 years without a hitch. Solidly built small keyboard.
__label__1 Too small to use!: I did my research before buying this and found a height chart to use to select the size of exercise ball to order. This was way too small for me even though I'm short - 5'2"! I don't use it at all.
__label__1 DOWN WITH VINCE & THQ!: VINCE & THQ, YOU GUYS ARE GOING DOWN FOR MAKING A GAME THAT MAKES EVERY PERSON BEATING UP EACH OTHER AND HATING ONE ANOTHER! SO PACK YOUR BAGS AND F^CK OFF OUT OF HERE, DO YOU READ ME PUNKS! GOOD, NOW GET THE HELL OUT OF TOWN OR I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE Y'ALL STINKFACED!!!!!!!
__label__2 Headphone: Sound quality is very good for such an inexpensive headphone. I like that it sits on top of the ear and behind the head. I can wear it for hours without discomfort.
__label__2 A Wonderful Source of Nutrition!: I am a regular purchaser of dried Goji berries, and the Navitas product has been excellent. I enjoy it softened in tea. I appreciate the taste as well as knowing that I am promoting healthy living.
__label__1 Very difficult to drain: I filled it to the lower rib .it took over 2hours to drain the pump only holds 2.5 gallons which meant many trips to empty. Not safe unless you have two people for severe helpless patient plus the pillow floated out from my daughters head.
__label__1 Really bad experience. Beware of bad shipping from Amazon: Ordered Horizon treadmill CT61 from Amazon, received in broken box with broken plastic pieces from all sides. I cannot figure out what belongs were as its in pieces. When called Amazon Customer service, they told me to buy a new box and pack it up for pick-up which will be scheduled in 5-7 business days. Customer representative was very rude and just mean. Be aware to spend more time hustling with Amazon folks rather spending on treadmill.
__label__1 This movie stunk: I usually like all things that have to do with the Tutors or Anne Boleyn, but this movie didn't cut it.Most of the characters were miscast for one.The way the story was told stunk.I read the book "The Other Boleyn Girl" and enjoyed that, but this movie version was a waste.Guess after seeing "Anne of the Thousand Days" so many times, I am spoiled. That is the best Henry 8/Anne Boleyn movie ever.Only reason this movie gets 2 stars is the costumes and scenery were nice to look at.
__label__2 Easy to install: The filters were surprisingly easy to install. The instructions provided in the package were well written and understandable and I had my new filters in place and operational in a minimal amount of time. Our water is now drinkable again.As for the vendor, we received the order in the amount of time stated (7 - 10 days) and had no billing errors so we're happy on that front as well.
__label__2 Once again arrived safe.: This is the second purchase of this item. The first time the bulbs came inside two cartons for breakage. This time there was only one carton and the bulbs were still intact. Greener(less packaging). Congratulations.
__label__2 Works with Corvette C6 Transparent top: I fail to see why people would not simply remove them at night. If its going to block out sunlight, don't you think it will obstruct your view at night? Takes 2 seconds to pop off and fold back up.That said, I bought it for my C6's targa top. Works great, and does not flap around with the windows down at least at 60mph and below. I fold it up and throw it behind the passenger seat when not in useSuction cups are not effected by the middle hump.Since it is oval it does not fit into the corners, so there is about a 1-2in rounded gap. But again its a best fit kinda thing. Length wise it fits exactly at the middle, width wise it is slightly bigger, but will conform around the rear latch.
__label__2 A Must for Beginner Bass Players: My 15-year old daughter has been taking guitar bass lessons. Her teacher suggested she obtain this book to assist the learning process. I believe this book is considered the Bible of learning the important principles of beginning guitar. Her teacher also said there are two more continuing editions of this book that he will ask her to get as her lessons progress.
__label__1 Does not play on PS3: The 1-star rating is because the disk did not work in my PS3, not that the film itself was sub-standard.This is the first blu-ray disk that I have purchased which did not work on my Sony PS3. I googled the error code and found that a lot of other people have had the same problem with this title. The end result is that the manufacturer said that they would send me a free replacement that would work in the PS3. The forum where other people said they had the same problem with this disk dates back to mid 2006 and I bought my copy in from Amazon April 27, 2007 so this is not a new problem. Sounds like the manufacturer is going to correct the problem, but I do not know when that will happen.
__label__1 Could have been alot better.: I got "Lone Rider" because the book looked interesting and the reviews were pretty good. Well never buy a book based on its cover. I was very dissapointted! "Lone Rider" was bad. It seem from page one that there was something different about a Dallas and it didn't take long to find out. And Tess seemed like a character without a clue. If you are for a great romance writer check out Lori Foster
__label__2 Virtuoso? YES!: As a "freak guitarisst" I really LOVE Yngwie J Malmsteen, and i belive that NO ONE ever will play like this guitar GOD (exepct me ;). On this movie he is in relly GOD SHAPE!!! I have 5 Live Videos with Malmsteen, and i blevie this one is "THE BEST ONE", he is so cool! Look when he plays "Riot In The Dungeons", when he have played the intro , he swing the guitar around NICE..If you wanna be impressed SEE THIS MOVIE DUDE!!!!Stay TUNEDDaniel Rneberg SWEDEN
__label__1 Hey, Publisher? READ THE BOOKS: It is clear that no one involved in this publishing company ever read these books. This brings publishing to a very low level indeed. Do not buy this edition of these classic and wonderful books - find something created in the spirit of the books. Anne is described as a red-haired ten year old. So who is this on the cover? The town teen floozy from down the road? It is bad enough that books today are spell-checked and not proof-read, but to not even have the details of the main character represented in the art work is sloppy publishing and should not be supported.
__label__2 A genuine clash of Kings no less: This is the second time I read this book since I want to catch up with the story before I read A Dance with Dragons. If you got hooked on Game of Thrones you will get by this book in a breeze. It's full of action and suspense. You keep trying to figure out what goes on in some of the characters minds jus to be surprised by their decisions. You don't get to know much about important characters as Rob Stark and Jaime Lannister, but you get to follow Arya's adventures up close as well as Sansa's tribulations. You get to see how Daenerys is transforming into an empowered and self assured woman and Queen. And the struggle for power and the Iron Throne just gets better by the minute. It is a genuine clash of kings.
__label__1 A little disappointed: I have been reading Debbie Macomber's books for about 2 months now. I read the Cedar Cove series and I'm waiting on book No. 8. I thought they were just fabulous. I also read one of the angel series. I thought it was excellent. "One Night" was so much like a corny Harlequin. There seemed to be "too much" excitement with sex and too much "in love" business going on. It was an ok read, but I much prefer books written like Cedar Cove.
__label__2 Perfect gift: We live in Texas and my cousin loves UK. So I ordered this outfit for his new baby boy! They loved it. Good price, shipped on time and made my cousin Happy. I would buy this again if needed.
__label__1 Don't bother: Great idea, but the bags are cheaply made and often just won't seal. Wasted money and lots of frustration.
__label__2 3 of the four: We have four dogs three of the dogs it works great on the fouth one figured out that if she barks long enough she runs it out and then she can keep barking.
__label__2 Stroboframe is the Standard for a quality 35mm flash bracket: Stroboframe is the standard in 35mm Flash Brackets. Good quality, easy to pack in a camera bag. Essential equipment for both professional and novice photographers. I have 2 now one on an older Nikon D40 (nice back-up) and one on a new Nikon D3100. They serve their purpose and work perfectly with the Nikon SB-600 and SB-900 Speedlight flashes. The "generic" iTTL off camera hot shoe supplies by Adorama Camera works fine with both Nikon cameras and Speedlight flash units. Excellent quality and a good price. They even include black Velcro cord keepers for the 3' coiled flash cord to secure it out of the point of view.
__label__2 Thousands of years of history packed into 1 book!: If you only had room for one book on Chinese history, this should be it. It amazingly covers history from China's early beginnings to more recent events.
__label__2 LOVE this car!: Found this car at a locally owned toy store and got it for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas. She LOVES this car! She has so much fun riding it around the house. It does not go on carpet and beware that it will leave tracks/scratches on your hardwood floor, but it is so much fun. On Christmas Day everyone took turns riding it (even Grandpa took a turn on it). My husband and I fight over who gets to ride when she goes to bed. I am sure we will be purchasing another one (or two) when it gets warmer outside.I don't regret this purchase for a second. My daughter has to show EVERYONE who comes to the door her "cool new car" (even the pizza delivery man) and everyone thinks it is the coolest thing!!!
__label__2 timeless: We are so lucky to be alive in an age of recorded sound. Artists such as the Beatles, Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, and Nick Drake will live forever and sing to each new generation. Do yourself a favor and pick up all of Nick's albums. He was an amazing songwriter, superb guitarist, and oh...what a golden voice. I cherish all his recorded work and you will too. I hope you're in a good place Brother Nick.
__label__2 Go Elmo!: My grandaughter loves this DVD. I have her nearly every day during the week and her request is always for bananas Elmo. She is two.
__label__2 Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special: I haven't seen it yet, but if it's like his others it will be great. He is a great puppet man
__label__1 Could've Been Better: Was expecting to hear some great Broadway selections by one of the greatest vocalists ever. I was pretty disappointed. All but one of these songs are slow and schmaltzy - the lone exception is "On the Street Where You Live" which, while catchy, didn't exactly live up to what it could've been. The best songs are the ones not actually on the album - go to YouTube and search for "Tell Me On a Sunday" and "Pinball Wizard". Much better selections. Still, "Someone to Watch Over Me", "Summertime" and "It's in Every One of Us" are decent cuts also. Just thought it would be a lot better.
__label__2 Outstanding!!!: I don't write a lot of reviews unless I am very impressed with a product and this one definately does that. It makes it so much more enjoyable to can for the simple fact that you don't have to babysit your canner. It really does maintain the pressure right where you need it. I love being able to do other things during this process. I still check it once in awhile out of habit but it is always right on. Highly recommend this product.
__label__2 speed problem fixed: I wrote in a previous message that I was going to return the PS12U print server because it printed large files (photos) very slowly (around 20 minutes instead of 4 minutes if I recall). Hawking just sent me firmware rev 6.09.17e and now that 4 minute print only takes 4:30. This is good enough for me given the convienience of a network printer.
__label__1 Wow! The Author repudiates his own book!: I've never laughed so hard in my whole life.It's pretty funny to see all these folks praising the book and telling us how full of "truth" it is, when the Author *himself* says that he was wrong, and that he has taken the book out of circulation, because it is historically false and full of untruths.He has written a _new_ book, called the "Babylon Connection", in which he retracts everything he wrote in this book ("Babylon Mystery Religion").Unbelievable!
__label__2 The Remaking of V: All I have to say is that I love it, love it, and totally love this re-imaging of the original series "V" that was brought out in the early 80s! The re-imaging is dark, scary, and the plot is strong, and the actor, and actresses are totally into their parts. I place this remake of the show right up there with the re-imaging of Battlestar Galactic. It's that good in my opinion.
__label__1 nothing to review: Got the video very fast and gave a good feedback, however the video was blank. Didn't bother bitching as it was cheap but I can't write a review for something I didn't see.
__label__1 Contrived and forced. How could you people recommend this?: Nice packaging. Not good pop music, however. Neither catchy nor melodic. Very contrived and very forced. If you were expecting Fountains of Wayne, don't look here.
__label__1 My first review eeeeeever: I have never written a review before....but after hearing this steaming pile of crap I purchased I felt the need to stop others from buying it as well.....I really expected LB to come out with their most killer CD to date to prove to the masses they are a band to be reckon with with or without their former guitar player/song writer.....instead we got this......Results May Vary?? I don't think so Fred......Results Do Suck!! I want my money back....and just a suggestion....I know rap-rock is "out" now....but you can't sing dude.....and pleeeeeease don't use these slams to your new CD as material for your next CD....none of us feel bad for you now that you wrote a complete CD about how "nobody likes me....everybody hates me....I'm gonna go eat worms".......Congrats Fred......you went from Nookie and Break Stuff to filling up used CD bins across the nation!!!
__label__1 stuck forever on mission 2: played mission where you have to blow up a whole bunch of boats and barges going down a river in a certian amount of time. I've tried aleast 75 to 100 times and can't get any further. When are they going to program in by-pass capability so when your stuck at least you can move on, finish the game and get your moneies worth of play from it.
__label__1 Great concept. Execution drags along.: "Hausu" seems to try combining two 70s trends (the zany live-action Saturday morning show and the Supernatural Horror movie) with some schoolgirls fetishism. You'd think that would be a winning lunatic combination, but the movie gets the pacing wrong and drags along much of the time.
__label__2 great for those dairy dishes!: I have been lactose intolerant for a long time. I finally started using Lactaid products when the stomach aches and bloat got bad with small amounts of dairy. I've used these caplets and they always work...sometimes I take 2 just in case. The only reason I won't buy these again is because I found that I don't necessarily always have a drink or liquid to take them with. So, I am going back to the chewable vanilla ones.
__label__1 boring book.: The basic storyline of The Bug has potential, but Ullman does not do a good job making the storyline interesting. Many connections are never quite made, and her character's connection to the story is kind of lame. From a litereary viewpoint the book just isnt very good.If you are interested in programming, all of the programming talk will probably be interesting, but the basic storyline is very lacking. the ending is also pretty lame. all in all, i wouldn't recommend this book unless you're interested in programmning, and even then its a little bit of a snore. sorry ms. ullman.
__label__2 I just had a close shave.: I am very pleased with my new Braun 5614 Flex XP electric razor.It gives me very close and clean shaves, but never irritates the skin. What more could you ask for?Did I geet my moneys worth? Yes, indeed.Paul Arvin
__label__1 Not Thrilled: I bought this toy thinking it would be good for my kids home schooling. The older kids thought it was childish and my 4 year old got tired of using her finger and having to keep a tight fist so her palm or other fingers would not get in the way and make the wrong word play. She also grew tired of having to point all the time. The 2 books that came with it are flemsy and short. I just found out there are only 7 more books available. Perhaps, if more books were available I would not be so disapointed.
__label__2 PS One is TIGHT!: I Just got my First Playstation today and I've only played on it (with GT2) for 3 hours and I love it. Ive owned a N64, an original Game Boy, Game Boy Color and an SNES and this already blows them out of the water. The Graphics are impressive for a small 32-Bit system and the case is small and convienient. The Vibration feature adds alot of life to the games and the system runs smooth and quiet, and is NOT made of cheap parts. The feel of the equipment is high tech and durable. I Have seen my friends play PS2 and the graphics are nearly identical to PS One. Like alot of PS One owners, I could not (and I still cant afford a PS2). So If you can do without a DVD player, go ahead and get PS One. The bottom line is, get this system if you are not willing to splurge $300 on a PS2, and get it soon.
__label__1 Two Defective DVD's in a Row: ZULU has always been a movie favorite of mine. When I saw it on Amazon, I immediately jumped at the chance to purchase it. Arriving in late March 2000, the DVD was defective - skipping from scene to scene. At such a bargain price, I didn't bother to write Amazon. Today (4-8-00) I purchased ZULU from a retail store. Once again, a defective DVD. All other DVD's work well. While the movie is one of the best action films made, it seems this DVD version was made too cheaply to be viewable. Hope others have better luck.
__label__2 Another outstanding entry in a fine series: This is a non-stop page turner from one of the best mystery writers around. I especially enjoyed the way Elizabeth George uses a major character's diary to show the process of psychoanalytically oriented therapy and the psychological changes he went through as his repressions began to unravel. If you like great writing and psychological insights, I highly recommend this book. This is a series with very interesting continuing characters, so if you enjoy this one, give yourself a real treat and read the series in order.
__label__1 Buyer Beware: I bought this item just because it was a Belkin cable. In the picture, you can see the Belkin logo under the clip on the end of the cable. This is not the cable that I received. It was a standard Patch cable made by a no name company with a white sticker on the package that said 'Belkin' on it. I am sure the cable will work, but this is not a Belkin Cable like the product says it is.
__label__1 Not to my taste: I bought this to help me through recovery from open heart surgery. It may have worked but I really didn't like the style of it at all, though I did use it consistently for a while.
__label__1 Everything you did not wanted to know about WAP...: This is the best way to get really confused before writing your first WAP application. Try Ben Forta. Application programmers need a simplified architecture showing what is relevant to their task. This book is not relevant to my task. I regret I bought it.
__label__2 Great Reading........Even if You Don't Cook: Great ideas, great food, tasty and healthy. Fun to read. Coffee Table Cookbook! Makes a great gift.
__label__1 I give up: Western Chief has really cute boots, but they fall apart in a matter of a month or two. My son loved to tromp around in the backyard in these camo boots, but the rubber has split apart in so many places already that they are not longer water proof.
__label__2 Good humidifier: I have been pleased with this purchase. It is quiet... not completely silent in the high setting, but not annoying... like a fan. If you google "How to clean a humidifier filter," you can get directions for cleaning your filter which will save you a lot of money (since replacements are pricey). This does put a lot of humidity in the air. It would be nice if the tank held more water, but that is my only complaint. I have tried NUMEROUS other humidifiers, and this is a good one. The ultrasonics (this humidifier is NOT an ultrasonic) are truly silent (and less expensive), but they really wet the floor around them when in use. I am buying another of these since we have a large house.
__label__1 It doesn't even get warm to the touch, much less heat a bottle!: We got this for on the go use and it doesn't even warm up to the touch. It's a heating pad you wrap around the bottle and how is it supposed to heat a bottle if your hands are warmer than the wrap? It took over 45 minutes to take a cold bottle to even room temp (we used Playtex Ventaires) and by then you might as well have just left it sit at room temp. Useless product. We now take a thermos of heated water and a jar and heat our bottles in the the jar. Cheaper, faster and even more portable. I wish I'd still had the receipt for this thing, I couldn't figure out any use for it so we tossed it. What a waste of money and landfill space :(
__label__1 Great bluesman -- bad DVD: Sorry, but this DVD is a waste of money unless you want grainy clips with bad sound from old concerts. Winter is still one of the best bluesmen alive and it would be great if he could muster a concert DVD with better production values. This isn't it.
__label__1 predatory marketing: I just bought an R260, then found that Epson has fixed it so it only works with Epson ink cartridges. DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER! If you do, you will be stuck with whatever price Epson demands for the cartridges FOREVER. I note that other reviewers say the printer is very ink-thirsty - I never got to the stage to find out, but the combination is truly frightening. No wonder they sell the printer with ink for little more than the ink alone. It is a con game.
__label__2 YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!: This is probably one of the best books on ahadith I have ever read. It's in an easy to read format and has guidance to live by in your daily life.It is the type of book you can use as a reference and something you can read as an inspirational hadith of the day.I just love it!
__label__2 Answers the tough questions: I found this book helpful in studying the bible. I especially liked how the author explained why God permits evil. This book really harmonizes the word of God. It is a must have for every Christian.
__label__2 One of My Favorite Japanese Cookbooks: A great introduction and "Go To" book for various aspects of Japanese cooking including some of the unique/foreign ingredients along with cookware and utensils you may come across or be interested in. A real asset. This section is followed with well described recipes that even the uncertain should feel confident in pulling off. The full color photos are very helpful and add to the value of this book. This is easily one of my favorite Japanese cookbooks. If you are interested in Japanese food, you should own this one. I *LOVE* it.

__label__1 Can't believe those weak guys: I won't mention about the quality of this product. But this standbag doesn't have enough weight to stand my punch. I filled this with water to the full, and when I throw a hook the front part goes up in the air and comes down. Am I supposed to fill this up with lead?I'm not bragging. I am below average young males' heights and weights, I don't work out, never had a boxing training, just sometimes visit the gym with sandbags and throw punches when I'm depressed.I can't believe those guys who wrote the reviews are so weak to be satisfied with this stuff. I'm returning this and get a real heavy bag, even if it will cost a lot.
__label__2 Delightful movie: Probably appeals to the older viewer rather than the young. No mayhem, no nudity, no blowing things up, just great acting
__label__2 Barbie A Fairy Secret: This was purchased for my granddaughters ages 2 and 6. They both love it and want it to play over and over. The colors, movements, and dialogue captivate them.
__label__1 Limited Usage: This charger only works for charging iPod Shuffle. It doesn't work for my 30G video iPod with USB iPod connecting cable. There are products out there that cost about the same or a little less but work with all iPods. I wonder why the engineers even bother to make a product with such limitations. :(Here's the message from tech support:Problem: I bought the AVB USB car charger to charge my 30Gig iPod Video by using the USB cable that came with the Video iPod that connects to the charger's USB port. Does it work this way for charging my video iPod? Or is this charger works only with iPod Shuffle?Answer: The AI-03 USB car charger is made for the iPod Shuffle, which has lower power requirements than the standard iPod. To be exact, it has an output of 5 volts, and 400mA.Sincerely,Marcos RoybalAVB Technical SupportTel:562-903-7002 Ext.107MSN Messenger: support@avbusa.com
__label__1 just a tad boring: song intros are drawn out and redundant. Vocal melodies are forgetable. Maybe i should have got a nickelback cd, or better yet, gone to sleep.
__label__1 Nice Idea, but didn't last: This holster was a love/hate relationship. I loved the way I could get at the buttons/screen w/o the holster getting in the way but I hated how it effected the unit. Specifically when I had the Treo 650 in the holster, I found that that it squeezed the screen in a way that prevented the digitizer from working right. when I tried to point at something on the screen it the "click" would be somewhere else. Try to click the appointment at 10am and get the one at noon instead, things like that.Took me a while to figure out that I had to take the treo out for it to work right.one of the sides that hold the treo in place broke off, I assume because i had to keep removing the treo to get it to work right.Total time of use, about 2 months
__label__1 Totally Boring!!!!: I am reading this book for high school summer reading. It is the most boring book ever written! There is no humor at all and the main character has no personality and talks about pointless stuff that we dont care about. God! i waisted one week of my life on this boring peice of crap. I recomend that the book should not be read by children because of explict language. Please ignore this book at all costs.
__label__2 Great family movie: This was a very good family movie with no cussing, nudity or crudeness. It is very rare to find a movie like this these days that the whole family of all ages can enjoy. We loved it!
__label__2 Perfect gift for the Vegan in your life: Purchased this basket as a birthday gift for my mother who recently had to switch to a vegan diet for her arthritis. She was delighted to be able to enjoy treats, which is a rarity.
__label__2 nifty ice cube tray: Overall, I like this ice cube tray. Yes, it can be difficult to fill because of the unique shape of the tray and its flexibility. But, its great to be able to add several of the cubes to water bottles before I go running. A quick word of advice for filling, find something that will help keep the tray flat as you move it to the freezer. I found that if you refill it right after emptying it, the new water will start to freeze right away. It won't completely solidify, but it will form a very small layer of ice on top, which makes the water less likely to swish around.
__label__1 NO BATTLE SONGS PRESENT: I bought this album with the full expectation that the battle songs would be on it. After all, the CORE of the ENTIRE movie is based on the battles. So, tell me then, how could it be that NOT ONE battle song is present on the CD? I felt completely misled, and ripped off. The songs on the CD have nothing to do with the movies core energy....DANCE BATTLES. So, your lucky to see even one star here, there should be negative 5 stars for the incredible 'bait and switch' that the studios have pulled on us moviegoers.
__label__1 ALL FALSE: THIS BOOK IS A DISGRACE 2 DA RELIGION OF ISLAM. I MUST SAY DAT WHOEVA DECIDES 2 BUY DIS BOOK MUST NOT HAVE ANY RESPECT FOR ANY MUSLIM. THIS BOOK MUST STOP FROM PUBLICATION N MUST BE BURNED WIT THOSE WHO HAVE MADE IT!!
__label__1 Horrible quality - frequent streaming interruptions: Rented the movie via instant viewing and the frequent streaming interruptions ruined the experience.Oh well, live and learn.
__label__2 Schwinn 130 Upright Bike: I had some concerns after reading the conditions of the shipped bike but everything was fine. Box was damaged a bit however all parts were in it. Bike was easy to put together and works great. One reason I picked this bike is its small footprint. My wife really likes it and uses it almost daily.
__label__2 Every American should see this: Thesis: The abysmal post-war failure of the U.S. in Iraq is primarily the fault of civilian leadership in D.C., epitomized by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. These leaders were totally ill-prepared for the aftermath of the war and consistently overruled the wisdom of military commanders and U.S. envoys on the ground who sought additional U.S. troops and a significant role for both the Iraqi military and the former leaders of Saddam Hussein's government -- men and women who could have helped stabilize the Iraqi nation followed the ouster of Saddam Hussein. Well researched.
__label__2 Quick Release Skewers: Had an older bike that I wanted to fix up, this went on great, and I haven't had any problems yet!
__label__1 it is the worst CD that you can buy: It is terrible.The Freshman is good but all of the other songs are unbeleivably terrible. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk it is like throwing money away.
__label__1 Not for Mac based developers: If you're a PC developer, this book is OK for you. If you are a Mac (or UNIX?) based developer, stay away from this book. About 1/2 of the book is dedicated to forms development packages that only work on a PC platform.
__label__2 Cool mold: These glasses are pretty cool, I have seen a lot of creative stuff done with them like freezing mint leaves or whatever. My only issue is that it takes some work to get the glasses out once they're done.
__label__1 Not so great!: I bought this hoping it would work as well as my Mr. Clean Autodry System because that too has been discontinued. It did not. I've washed my car 4 times with it and each time I end up with lots of spots. Oddly enough, when it rains on my car after a wash the spots go away. Weird! Unless, I'm using the product wrong it does not leave a spotless shine without wiping the car down with a chamois afterwards(which I haven't tried yet). I do like the way it soaps up the car. I will probably save the unit and refill it with car soap when I wash my car in the future.
__label__1 The Internets have spoken! Say NO to price gouging!: I really want these movie on Blu-Ray, but I want BOTH versions. In this day and age that is more than possible: It's expected. Go back from whence you came. Dark sales tactics will not avail you! YOU SHALL NOT PASS!
__label__2 Kudos Mr. Carter!: This book takes you nearly to the end of the world and scares the bejesus out of you. I personally hope that with all of the ancient myths and other anomalies in this book, it stays fiction.Mr. Carter has done a great job. As you follow Jacob, Marsha and Pappy through the book, you feel like you know them and you feel for them. You actually find yourself hoping they make it ok. I won't give away any more of the story, but I will say: I don't ever want to meet one of your dragons.Good Job Mr. Carter! I can't wait for more books from you. I hope you are busy writing.Recommendation: HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDLynn Young is the Managing Editor of The MWLA review, a Reviewer and Editor
__label__2 sanding discs: Love these sanding discs. so easy to install and they last quite a long time. Have mostly used the finishing ones.
__label__2 Hotter than Satan's Own Sauce Piquante!: This CD changed my life! Back in the late '80s, I was content to listen passively to jangly REM and mopey Smiths tunes... that is, until I bought myself a copy of BOILED ALIVE! This record resurrects the spirit of Hank Williams, Howlin'Wolf (he's dead, isn't he?), Johnny Ace, Jimi Hendrix and Sid Vicious all at once. From the opening "BUUUUURP" of the band on the live mic to the last kerrang of Bill Davis' mighty axe, this CD rocks you like a class 5 hurricane. You can't help but bang your head to the Williams classic "Jambalaya" --wait a minute-- bang your head? Sure. And what of the raunchy cover of the schmaltzy Helen Reddy tome "Delta Dawn"? Quite simply the definitive version, I say. So, if you're a young'un, a-listenin' to your Oasis and your Backstreet Boys, and you feel like you oughta pay homage to the rock and roll messiahs, flip this disc onto your digital doodad and get yourself BOILED ALIVE!
__label__1 Lid does not seal-not airtight: I use this cup in 2 cup size for making salad dressing. I make enough for a couple of nights and like to put the rest in the refrig. I had been covering my cup with saran, so I jumped at this cup with lid. Problem is, it does not seal. There is a big gap between the spout and the lid. So, the dressing dries out or the dressing (if garlic/onion/shallot) smell permeates through the refrig. It does not seal so liquids will leak out of the spout. It would be good for pouring off liquids from, say, micro'd veggies.The other irritating thing is, I have 2 other PYREX 2-cup measuring cups (I bought this 3rd cup bec of the lid), and the lid doesn't fit them.
__label__1 Expensive price for an advert !: If the technology is certainly interesting and full of promises, the book is not. It contains only basic information on ESRI's products and a CD with demos that you can find on the ESRI web pages. ESRI's white papers offer much more material for free. Last but not least, this emerging technology is changing constantly and the book is already outdated in many point of views. Don't bother buying it and spend more time reading online GIS magazine which will keep you informed every day about new web mapping sites. And yes, there are other GIS developers than ESRI...
__label__2 Great Great Great: I love this book. I was having a difficult time setting up "centers" in my classroom, and this pointed me in the right direction. It is a necessary addition to any teacher's library.
__label__2 Brutality at it's Best: Amazing... Simply amazing. These guys have taken the classic North American Death Metal style and absolutely BRUTALIZED it! The vocals are absolutely low, intermixed with gutteral screeches... Like the wind of death mixed with the screeching of the damned. The band is amazingly tight. The guitars keep a nice balance between high and low, and the drummer is right on with everyone else. The drummer can KILL with his bass drum. Amazing double bass work here, mixed with blazing blast beats. Everything comes around with a beautiful balance between band and vocals. And, a plus for this band: Tired of the regular gore lyrics? Well, these guys don't go with it... They write about other stuff... Way more interesting. Go for these guys... They own!!!! BUY!
__label__2 Coldplay one of the BEST BANDS EVER...: I loved this album! I love Chris Martin's voice I find it very soothing like a warm bath. Also, I loved the insturments! And I hate all of you who give Coldplay less than three stars because this is one of the most AMAZING BANDS EVER!
__label__2 Outstanding Read: I literally could not put Reflections down when I started. I thought it was going to be another book of war experiences..it is much, much more, Throughout I can see that Ryan was chosen to be God' herald in sharing how God was at work all around him in Ramadi Iraq. From the tragic loss of 18 Marines in a Copter Crash, the Battle of Fallujah and finally the elections that freed Iraq you can see God' fingerprints in every detail of these events.I recommend to not only troops serving In the Military but to all since we are all on the Battlefield and it brings reassurance that God is with us wherever we go in order for us to fulfill our purpose in HIS plan.
__label__1 Bad Narrator: The narrator keeps talking when the characters are talking, making two subtitles, and two verbal discussions that all compete with each other. The story itself is standard anime
__label__2 battery load tester: The Actron CP7612 battery load tester works well and gives reliable info regarding battery performance. The only caveat is to remember the unit gets quite hot and following the instructions specifically in terms of how long to leave the unit "on" is important to avoid overheating.
__label__1 Cheap Product: These "Farberware" cutting boards are nothing like the actual higher quality Farberware cutting board that I bought a few years back. The wood is not sanded, grooves are poor quality, and the boards are not oiled.
__label__2 HIGH ON MY LIST OF FAVORITES: Fiction First Aid, by Raymond Obstfeld, is packed with practical, no-nonsense tips for troubleshooting a manuscript that "needs something." It's organized simply, with chapters about plot, characterization, setting, style, theme, and the writer's life. Each chapter has sections describing symptoms, the ailment, diagnosis, and treatment. Because the author's approach assumes that the reader has already written a manuscript, I wouldn't recommend Fiction First Aid as the very first "how-to" book for a novice. But this one is high on my list of favorites.
__label__2 Perfection: WOW, what a nice product. Within the first hour of it's arrival, I had to see if I could screw it up somehow as I would either under cook or over cook my rice. The very first use of this cooker boasted a very nice texture of rice. I cannot wait to continue making rice in the future. For those of you that are as inept as I was at cooking rice, I would highly recommend this cooker if you enjoy rice as much as I do.FYI, the rice I am using is Mahatma Jasmine
__label__2 Drifting Away: Like most people here, I got this CD for Drift Away, which is a fantastic cover. The other songs on here aren't bad, either. Uncle Kracker is a much better singer than one would expect from his Kid Rock roots. i even ike his rap/rock combo style. That's a big compliment considering I am not a fan of most rap music. The only draeback is the hidden track. It was vulgar apparently just for the sake of being vulgar. It kept this thing from geting five stars. I don't see wh Uncle Kracker feels the need to put such tracks on his CDs to earn his stripes. His vocal talents are more than enough to sell CDs without a parental advisory sticker to attract attention.
__label__1 alright: I really don't know what to think of this foundation. The coverage is okay. But every time I wear this foundation it makes my skin look pink.
__label__2 Great Sharpener: Recommended by a friend who makes swords and knives. I love this sharpener!!! Can cut hairs with the edge I was able to achieve on my "unsharpenable" kitchen knives. Took it to my mother-in-laws and sharpened all her knives also :)
__label__2 An adult sim: I have enjoyed this game. It seems easy but you'll find yourself out of time or money before you have met your objectives. You don't feel cheated, it makes you want try again and again. Maybe no one will drown and perhaps you can even turn a profit. I'm looking forward to many hours of entertainment.
__label__2 Just the thing: Once you learn the right amount and how to apply it, it's great. It washes off nicely, too. And it has a pine kind of scent. But don't use too much or...blister city!
__label__1 Groin grabbingly weak: I gave this cd 2.5 stars Because i dont think this cd is that great. I wanna hear somthin that gonna get chu hyped up not no slow downed rap. Some of his songs in my opinion remind me of that rapper common but just not relaxing. The best rap on this cd is the one with nate dogg. now that song is crackin. Also when i hear this cd i hear a voice of the past. (can you say 2pac?)The best songs on the cd mostly have some one eles in it like Ja rule. In other words Fabulous does not show much originality The bottom line is this: dont buy this cd expecting to hear anything equal or greater than the track that was released on the radio.
__label__1 Granted, it's a fictional story...: While the acting and direction are good, the production is not. This movie looks like it was shot with a home video camera (although the soundtrack was OK). Worst is the script. My 8 year old loved it, but it got only scorn from those over 11 in my house. Implausible even if it did reflect reality in China, which it does not. There is a real danger that because it so blatantly mis-represents the reality of orphans, Christians, and the Chinese government, that some will conclude that the well-documented persecution of Christians is also a fairy tale. I cringe to think there are people who might believe this movie represents reality. (...)
__label__1 Not safe - Paint came off immedeately: We got these for our 6 month old to play with during bath time. I boiled them to sterilize (which you should be able to do with toys that will end up in your baby's mouth), but the paint started rubbing off from one toy onto the other. Don't see a need for extra paint on a toy that will be chewed on. Will not give these to my daughter as she would get toxic paint in her mouth.
__label__1 Negative and poorly organized.: I got this from my insurance company when I enrolled in future moms. I started reading, excited and quickly became confused with the layout, the way the information is organized and appalled that each page seems to have a pregnancy ending condition on it.So far my favorite example of why I hate this book is, "If you think you feel your baby move, you probably have gas or are further along than you think."It's a preachy example of telling a pregnant woman she can't possibly know what's going on with her own body and that there are pitfalls and booby traps around every corner. I loathe this book.The illustrations are abysmal as well.
__label__2 A REAL Motivator!: I do not own the Personal Power 2, Yet! But, when I first saw his Infomercial at 1 o clock in the morning I was hooked! Now, at night I wait for his infomercial to come on! And I am disappointed when it doesn't.My point is...he is the REAL Thing! Just watching his Infomercial made me motivated to go do what I set out to do!!!Attend his Seminars, Buy his Products, Visit his Website, and Watch his Infomercials!!! Soon you will be on your way to Great Successes!!!!
__label__2 Excellent Product: I recently purchased this product and I couldn't be more happy. As others have stated you can have the remote learn any button not just the 4 learning buttons. This allows it to control any device (that is IR controlled). I have a liteon DVD player (LVW-5100) that didn't have a code, it took me a bit to figure out how to program the remote but within 30 minutes it was running all my equipment including the DVD player.For this price the product is a steal, if your in the market for a universal remote this should be high on your list. Don't forget to add some AAA batteries to your order though.
__label__2 in a word "fantastic": dreamy voice that will capture your heart whether the song is fast or slow, just fantastic.
__label__1 Some more below average work from Cradle: So after midian came out, I pretty much lost all faith in cradle of filth. Gone are the days of music like in the cd "Principle of Evil Made Flesh". I remember when I first heard these guys and how much I enjoyed the uniqueness of the music. With this new release, it just shows the band going downhill even more. Don't get me wrong, this cd isn't horrible, but it's just not as good as the older stuff. There are a few songs on it that i like, but the songs that were redone, i feel that they just butchered them. I feel that this is a good cd for people, just getting into the black metal genre of music, but if you have been into it for a while, go for something else such as "dissection", "satyricon", "emperor", or maybe even some "dimmu borgir"....
__label__2 Very good. Nice and strong. Gets the job done.: I had one at work, but I wasn't sure I was going to find another one online. Opening cans without it, would bend and hurt my nails. It was great. It was very comfortable in my hand and didn't hurt me all. This came in very handy. No more painful memories.
__label__2 Oxford American Dictionary and Language Guide: I found this to be the most useful and comprehensive single volume dictionary of the many I own. Clear, easy to use, helpful with guidance on usage, it is a manageable-sized volume. I go to the New Shorter Oxford or Webster's Second (a classic) for hard to find definitions, but this answers most questions for me. It is much better than the Concise Oxford English Dictionary. I recommend it without reservation.
__label__1 Fire hazard! Do Not Buy: There are many reports that DeLonghi toaster-ovens (many models, including mine, model EO1260) become fire hazards because the timers fail and then do not shut off. The upper and lower heat elements remain at max heat indefinely. That is a clear fire hazard. Do Not Buy.
__label__2 Wonderful!: Spectacular! This one also I can't stop listening! The songs and the singer are fabulous; listening to him makes my moments very special!
__label__2 Unexpected Pleasure: What a story! From the beginning Mr. Richards was surprising me and it didn't stop when the book was done. My suggestion is to read this one without trying to figure it out ... and boy will you be surprised ... what a shocker! Please Mr. Richards I want more. I want to know what is going to happen to my new friends... Nancy, Michael, Drew, Susan and Ian. Thank you for an enjoyable and exciting adventure into the past and the future all at once. js
__label__1 Are You Serious?: Wow! I can't believe these people actually think this is a good movie. I am a proud owner of "Walk Like a Man." Not because I think it is a family friendly comedy, but because it is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen in my life. This movie is so bad I want to show it to all of my friends. I was so sad when this movie didn't show up on any of the top 100 worst movies ever...I just don't think enough people have seen it. So please, purchase this movie so that it can get the recognition it truly deserves.
__label__1 Very Disapointed!!: This would probably be a great toy if my son could hear it. You absolutely can not hear a single thing. I also thought the batteries were dead. It still did not help. I called FP and they said they have been getting tons of complaints on this - but that it is working properly. I will be returning it to the store. My son also has the laugh and learn house which he loves..
__label__1 atlanta journal-constitution: being a native of atlanta I looked forward to reading this newspaper. Unfortunately over the 4 days I had the subscription twice I did not receive the paper. No good explanation provided other than it was not provide. When the problem was resolved I still did not receive the missing issues. There were also gaps of data.
__label__1 Per company, not supposed to be your main vaccuum: Vaccuum runs for only 20 minutes maximum. Have no rugs, only tile. Called Eureka and the customer rep. said it was never intended to be a main vaccuum, that lightweight in the ads mean not a heavy duty vac - and that I can get a spare battery for $47.00. Told her I had paid that for the vac on Amazon.com - she said it was unfortunate that it doesn't say so in their ads.
__label__2 k.d. lang is a goddess: k.d.lang has a voice that just soars and is able to wrap itself around a song. I would call her a modern day Karen Carpenter. The depth of emotion in her singing and the songs on this album just show off that range. The theme of "drag" is carried throughout the album in the smokey sound of her voice and the literally smokey/airy titles of the songs. "The Air That I Breathe" is a perfect example of the floating vocals making a perfectly perfect ethereal atmosphere.This is an amazing album of songs sung by an amazing voice of our time. Haunting and moving. A definite must for any music lover and an absolute must for a k.d. fan.
__label__2 Better than I'd imagined!: It was with great anticipation that I first listened to Don't Stop the Carnival. Being a fan of Buffett's books and music alike, I was optimistic, but still wasn't sure how my idol would do with a musical. I was pleasantly surprised. The emotions of the women (Especially in "Sheila Says" and "Henny's Song") were clear and very real to me.The recording does make more sense if you have read the novel by Herman Wouk, however, I liked the characters better in the musical BEFORE I had read the novel.Parrotheads and Musical Fans alike should add this CD to their collection.
__label__2 Definitely a great book.: This book is soooooo helpful! Whenever I have a question about my past or want to understand how I feel I resort to this book! It has to be one of my favorite books about surviving. It's very cleary written and easy to read. I'm not one that likes to read a lot of "psychological talk," so this was a great read for me!
__label__2 I will show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes.: Daft Punk has BEEN playing at MY house, now I can sing about it.
__label__2 Get Comfy!: I really really like my snoogle! This is a great product for expectant mommies... I bought one when I was just 12 weeks pregnant. I have problems with my back and sciatic nerves and just couldn't find the right position to sleep in.... this helps! The snoogle promotes that great side-lying sleeping position our OBs all recommend, and it's comfortable no matter which side you have it facing. It can also be used for nursing, and for sitting up in bed when our noses get stuffy and we can't lay down! The only downfall is it doesn't come with a pillowcase, and I have already gotten makeup on its white cover while sleeping. Oh well. Definately recommend it. :)
__label__1 Would not recommend: The router was simple enough to set up and use, and the feature set is attractive. I purchased this for my parents' home, in which they have 2 PCs and a Playstation 2. Wireless features work very well around the two story house. The problem lies in attempting to one of the PS2 games. After almost exactly 20 minutes online, the PS2 is disconnected by the router. This is a very odd issue.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: Don't waste your money on this book. You might as well buy a textbook for the same price that you would be buying this book. Save your money and use 501 verbs instead. The main problem with 501 verbs (according to reviews) is that it is bad to study/learn with. Duh. It's meant to be a reference when you don't know how to conjugate a verb. And most of the verbs that are not in it are regular anyways, so why would you need the book...?
__label__1 Overpriced showpiece for your glass shelf: I was impressed by the pics and bought it for 30$. Its expensive, made in china stuff. Its not a toy. Its a small speaker with a fancy body but useless. I was under the impression that the idog will make some dancing moves with the rythm of music, so that my baby will love it. Its actually equivalent to flashing LEDs and thats why I feel its overpriced. So my dog is lying in the glass shelf. No use of it for me. It reminds me how stupid I can be in buying useless items.
__label__1 Total Rubbish.: The last reviwer is a bit daft. In some 70 years of reading History I have never read such lies, distortions, and incoherent gibberish. The author is CLEARLY appealing to ethnic sentiment over "EVIDENCE AND FACTS." I suggest readers read the dozen or so "Most Helpful Reviews." Those reviewers were very in depth and know their SUBJECT.
__label__2 I Like Water For Chocolate: I remembered watching this movie when I was just a teenager and being so moved by the love against all odds story. I recently bought the DVD and am very happy with it. If you can tolerate subtitles, look beyond the slightly less than perfect picture quality and accept the shorter cut the story is still as beautiful as I remember. The drama romance and tragedy of the story played out through Tita's cooking filled with the passions of her heart. Still one of my top ten favourite movies.
__label__1 Poor quality but it serves the purpose: I use this item when my wife is sleeping, so I don't disturb her.The distance from the TV (where the base is) to the couch (where I sit, wearing the headset) is about 10 ft. The reception is usually good, but sometimes I get a lot of static noise, buzzing, etc. Sometimes it goes away if I change my position, and some other times I need to change the frequency because the buzz becomes very annoying.The battery life is quite good, but I noticed that if I leave the headset off the cradle, even if powered off, the batteries still run empty in about two days.I wouldn't recommend this model.
__label__2 Excellent Web Editing Software: This software I believe is the best out their for 99% of websites. And when you factor in the price it is the best dollar for dollar without question.The software is simple and cheap enough for beginners, but it also has full database support, mysql, php interaction, so advanced users can benefit as well. I do a lot of script/database programming and I looked around and tried trial versions of a lot of editors and concluded that Namo is the best.
__label__1 Disappointed: Most of the songs on this CD are much different than her original released singles and radio cuts. It is a good CD but would rather have had her original recordings.
__label__1 not worth it: soooooooo not worth it.madea is 5% of the movie and 95% is some lame street drama.i was expecting madea funny stuff,i regret paying 4$ on demand
__label__1 Not on my recommended list...your choice: If you haven't read the works of Robert Stanek, you should pick those up before reading this book (and the rest of this series). Many contemporary writers seem to take crib notes from Stanek's works, but rarely give due where they should. Start with The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches books and go on to the Service of Dragons books. You'll note similar large casts of characters, similar structures to the story, and in some cases very similar plotting.
__label__2 A cheap way to haul drinking water around: Basic plastic 1qt GI canteen. The standard is that a person should drink 2L of water/day; I went with 1qt canteens just to make it easy to keep track of how much water or sports drink I consume when hiking (finish one before lunch, one for lunch/early afternoon, last one for rest of afternoon and evening). These are inexpensive and work. What more do you need? :-)
__label__2 The biggest and most a**-kicking sharkmovie of the decade: This movie made me jump in my seat. I've never been so pleased and scared at the same time! Everyone who loves scary movies need to see this one and they will never forget it!
__label__2 no nonsense dirty fighting: It's a book mainly focus on fighting techniques. It should have more information on how to prevent a violent situation and on verbal self-defense, but Kathy is a Martial Artist. It's great to learn phisical self defense specially dirty moves but you should be consider complementary reading after reading a more general book.About the moves, they are simple and very effective and many are design to work only against men. Yes, testicles are the number one target, and depicts many ways to exploit that weak spot even with pictures.So, highly recomended, specially for women who had a mother like mine who used to said that a lady never hits a man "down there", but really wants to learn how to beat a man.
__label__2 I adore this film: I purchased the 2005 version of Oliver Twist because I'd seen the trailer. This is one of those films that I have been watching again and again and again. Many times I will end up bored and wandering off because I feel fidgety with other films but this is in the category of ones that I'm not going anywhere when it's going.
__label__2 Best contemporary Christmas CD in years!: I found the songs to be extremely theologically sound and the music beautiful. This album is a great summary of what Christmas is really about-- God becoming man for the salvation of all people. Thank you, Kathy, for recording an album the entire family can enjoy.
__label__1 Another NO vote!: Tom Clancy's normal standard is "I cant put this book down", little else gets done while I'm reading a good Tom Clancy. But this one was "I cant keep awake". I fell asleep so easily reading this that I never got the thread.Tom Clancy may not have written this but his name is on the cover so he must get the credit for this book. Its a bad one!
__label__2 I got this copy of Hamlet with my Grade 12 English class.: It comes with the complete play, plus side-by-side definitions of the more obscure English words used and illustrations. Also included are essays on Shakespeare, his life, Elizabethan England and so forth to help put the play in perspective. Through high school, I had to study a total of three Shakespeare plays, the other two being Midsummer Night's Dream and Macbeth, and this was the best of the bunch. And that's considering at the end of Macbeth we watched Roman Polanski's blood-soaked movie version, and the 1935 Midsummer Night's Dream movie starring a very young (read: annoying) Mickey Rooney as puck. And if you're curious, we watched Mel Gibson's Hamlet movie. Kenneth Branagh's was still a few years away and it would've taken us a whole week to sit through that.
__label__2 Ranks among his best: I don't quite recall how I got introduced to Joe Satriani's music, but I do know that the music from this album was the first music I heard from him. If you want to introduce someone to the wizardry that is Joe Satriana, I think this is the album to start them off with. It's accessible, with nary a weak track of the bunch (except maybe Z.Z's Song, but I don't like that one because when I listen to this album, I wanna rock and not chill). My fave songs are Ceremony, Up in the Sky and the title track.
__label__2 squeeze-bulb Christmas gifts: All who received the bulbs were excited. None have used them yet that I am aware of. The shipping, etc., was good.
__label__2 Nice hair towels: I actually have these in the peach color. These towels remove a lot of water from my thick wavy hair in record time. They wash and dry in the machines like my other towels. I'm impressed with them.
__label__1 Rip Off - Isn't really an RF remote: This claims to be an RF remote. But buried in the manual is a note that you can't actually use it as an RF remote to directly control RF components. Instead, you have to buy the Powerblaster accessory, which costs more than the remote.Since this isn't really a RF remote, they shouldn't put "RF Capability" in its title. And they need to make it very clear in the description that you cannot use it to control RF components.If you don't care about RF, there are cheaper remotes than this. If you do care about RF, there are cheaper RF remotes than the price of this plus the powerblaster. So why buy this one?
__label__1 Vendor is Terrible: The product is OK. It's the vendor & Amazon.com I have a problem with. The product is extension poles for a roof rake. I ordered this through Amazon.com. The problem is the rake was being supplied by one vendor & the poles by another. This is the way Amazon does it. The rake was not in stock so I cancelled the order with the vendor. That was no problem. I tried cancelling the order with the pole vendor but they would not cancel the order even though it took them over a week to ship them. Now I have extension poles to a roof rake I do not have.I will not do business with Amazon.com again!
__label__1 Not that good....: Bought the book with higher expectations; it only does an introductory job into the field of WiFi, containing and gathering info you can readily find over the net, and does it half way. Would only recommend it to someone with no particular knowledge in the field, who knows what Wifi is, but has no clue after that. Could make a nice gift for a 12 yr old tecky
__label__1 Didn't Work on Our MAC: My son received this for a birthday gift. We own another I SPY computer game and it worked great. This one would not even launch. It was given as a gift purchased through Amazon but wrapped up and handed to my son, not given through the mail, so no packing slip. I tried to return this. First, I needed to know the giver's email address and home address to verify that this was indeed bought at Amazon. Fortunately, I had that information. The customer service person verified the game was bought at Amazon, but through a third party seller, so they were not obligated to honor a return. She did send me the third party information. They would not take opened software back. How do you know it doesn't work if you don't open it up and try it? I just spent eight dollars UPS shipping it back to Scholastic in hopes of an exchange. Other I SPY games do work on MACs, but this one did not. If you are going to try this, buy it from a store which will take it back if it doesn't work.
__label__1 It's ok: Breadmaker works great...does make a small loaf of bread in 45 minutes as advertized. However, all recipes seem to have the same texture...which isn't unpleasant, but not exciting. We use it in our RV with lots of success. It just doesn't make bread like our regular breadmaker that we have at home. It's also very difficult to adapt regular breadmaker recipes to this size...and, if they aren't exactly right, the bread isn't too good. So, it seems that you're limited to using only the recipes in the booklet that accompanies the breadmaker.
__label__1 I can sing to myself better than this........: I started off using the Belkin unit with 4 pre-set stations and no ability to tune it to other stations. All 4 stations were in use so off I went buying this unit. I found 2 spots in the frequency range with no other transmissions. The reception is extremely poor at both these spots. Stopping close to another car/wall makes matters worse.I think that the transmitter strength is not up to doing the job in an SUV. This was the bigest waste of time and money. Like somebody well known recently said: "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on you"
__label__1 Not that great: I agree with the man that said it was fun....when it worked. I too had a problem with getting the battery compartment open....and I DID use the correct screwdriver! You have to press down really hard as you are turning the screwdriver to get it open. My 6 year loved it and I think we played with it a total of 6 times and by the second day, it completely stopped working....could not get it to turn on. I went out to Target, bought a second one and it worked fine that night. The NEXT DAY, my son went to play with it with his friend and while it DID turn on, it would not "read" the colored bands on their hands! I am so frustrated because it really is a great concept, I just wished it worked!!
__label__2 WOW....: I really really love this book....Now waiting for Part 2 .Some loose ends that need to be complete....Thank you EJD!
__label__1 wrong product number: I ordered what my humidifier stated I needed to replace the filter,but what I recieved was not the right filter.
__label__2 Susan McKeown At Her Best!: This is, without a doubt, Susan's best album yet. Her voice has matured and her style is fully developed, leaving us with a delightful, refreshing taste of not-so-traditional Irish music. Every track is beautiful, even the somewhat-critized "Oró Mhíle Grá (A Thousand Times My Love)", though the sound is definitely one that takes some getting used to! "Sweet Liberty" and "Caledonia" are two lovely Celtic ballads that you'll listen to over and again.This album is also a must-have for fiddle-legend Johnny Cunningham fans. The last track, "When I Was on Horseback", a particularly haunting and poignant song, was recorded just one day before Johnny passed away, in December of 2003.If you're going to buy just one Susan McKeown album, make it this one!
__label__2 Good Things Come In Small Packages: I'm in high school and have read lots of magazines about Pilates. I tried a class at the gym, but I wanted to do some video 'research.' After reading a lot of reviews, I bought this one. This DVD is fairly low budget when it comes to the sets and atmosphere, but it's definitely traditional and I get a really good workout. Since I play basketball and swim on the team, I'm used to many hours of practice. This video is real and the people who made it are real. You can tell the demonstrators are professional athletes. They show Pilates and describe Pilates in a way that you can learn it right from the beginning, and do it right to the end.
__label__2 A loyal Tennessean: This is a nice historical video about agricultural development in the Tennessee valley and how control of regional flooding led to economic growth. Told in a story fashion as opposed to a completely informative documentary, so it can be shown to younger people as well.
__label__2 A Book Review: The subtitle of this book: "Eating all the calories and carbs you want to lose weight!" really caught my eye. I'm only 16 and I'm not too into losing weight but lately I have been really intrested in the science of nuitrition. So I thought I'd find out what this book had to say. It's a book in which author Roger Troy Wilson gives his weight loss testimony and then tells us, his eager readers, what he did. This is his meal plan:Breakfast: Eat fruit till your fullLunch: Big meal of the day. Eat lots of protien.Dinner: More fruit and some soupsI think he's got a point when he says that Lunch should be the big meal of the day because after lunch you are much more active than after dinner....thus burning more of the calories and carbs. This diet seems to have worked well for him and many others, so I say go for it if your willing to try! But as for me, I'll stick with my cereal for berakfast. ;)
__label__2 Awesome!!!: I have been using my Silpat mats for about a month now, they are the best thing ever. I used to use parchment paper which was cumbersome to use, the Silpat mats are as easy as 1-2-3 to use...they clean up very well and have not burned any of my cookies. It is true that you have to decrease your cooking time but if you bake enough that's not really that big a deal. I would recommend these to anyone!! No regrets with this purchase.
__label__2 ...But it's such a pain to clean!!!: No doubt about it, this is the perfect college dorm necessity (I graduated from college and I still use it). If you're sick of all that cafeteria food, just use this Forman grill. It's also the perfect size for 1-2 people. You can cook chicken, burgers, steak, etc. on here, but the hard part comes when you try to clean it. You're not supposed to "immerse" it in water, as the label says, so you have to clean it very carefully (one of the reviewers said to put two damp paper towels in between the grill after cooking; I have yet to try that). You shouldn't clean it with a steel wool pad because it'll take the coating off, so use a sponge or something better. If you make hamburgers on there, it'll take a while to clean, and even longer to dry if you should happen to get water in it. But those problems don't detract from the fact that this is a very useful appliance.*Also recommended for bachelor pads.
__label__2 Great bag!: i love the structure of the bag: the shoes compartment which has an internal sack that separates it from other articles inside the bag, the beverage pocket, the cd player pocket, and the cellphone pocket. the handle and strap are very sturdy. + the hard board lining on the bottom is an awesome touch.however, i gave only 4 stars because its shipping cost is too much for just a small bag and also because they used FedEx.FedEx... need i say more?ok, then; FedEx has lost, couldn't find my addressES, and had been late at delivery in every occasion. well, for me at least. i despise FedEx.that's why i appreciate Amazon using UPS.
__label__2 sadly: lo ascolto è pregiudicato in positivo dalla conoscenza della morte dell'autore, e dalle sue frequentazioni desert sessions.il disco è molto ispirato, malinconico, è quasi new age nel giungere nei pressi del non ritmo.
__label__2 LOVE IT!: This movie is just too cute for words. It has catchy tunes and you won't even mind watching it with your kids a million times each week. A definite "must have"!
__label__1 Are They Serious? "Let's Ride" Should Stick to Jumping!: This game is SUPER easy! I finished EVERY SINGLE COMPETITION IN 10 MINUTES!!! There is nothing hard about this game! And the so called "challenges" are so easy, I bet my dog could do them in 5 minutes! Save your $20 people. Go get "The Legacy of Rosemond Hill" or "Saddle Up: Time to Ride" games for real challenges and a lot of fun. It was sort of fun seeing the replays of the competition, but still, THIS GAME IS SOOOOO EASY!!!
__label__2 A book that provides great relief: the book is excellent. Can be wordy for some but it's a language book. Words are to be expected. It flows in a way that makes it almost natural to understand what is being said and taught. I recommend it for the student /teacher enviornment or even for the applied self learner. If your anywhere in between the two, think again,.....hooked on phonics'addition(if there is one?)might be better.wrc
__label__2 Not as funny: Dont get me wrong I think this is a great cd. Its just not as funny as you would expect from eminem. There is a lot of political stuff on the cd, and it seems more serious than the others. I guess you just cant do the same thing all the time. And I think that Halie song that he sings on and doest rap much is kinda [different]. But I dont have kids so I wouldnt know. Well, this is a great album so buy it, and make eminem more rich than he already is.
__label__1 The Least Coincidence: A playboy is murdered after committing a heinous act. If an innocent man hadn't confessed there would be no reason to solve the case. This is the most flawed of the Goldsborough Wolfe series I have read. Archie approaches a situation with no real plan and becomes a temporary red herring. Along with murder, which is the usual fare in these mysteries, another crime which sets the chain of events in motion seems out of place in a Wolfe mystery. Finally there is a murderer whose motive better fits a cop show on television. This book just does not match up well to the Nero Wolfe legacy and it really stands out as something that only gets published because Nero Wolfe is on the cover.
__label__2 Well thought out: Not finished just yet, but almost. This book is well written, well thought out. I started vegetarianism about a month ago and after reading and researching, have now moved to veganism. We don't realize how blind we are to what we put in our bodies or the impact we can make by being mindful of each bite, and in general each moment.Some parts are expected and I feel I have read in previous chapters, but perhaps just reiterating a necessary thought. Overall it is a great read and gives reason and solid sense to why you should really evaluate and actually think about the thing we most consistently do in our lives. Eat. Energy is important. Recommend the book fully.
__label__2 Great Insightful Book: This book was received in the requested time frame. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to get this book, read it, review it and tell others what I discovered.
__label__2 Good, but not great: I long for the days of Along Came a Spider and Kiss the Girls. Now THOSE were two great books. If this were any book other than an Alex Cross novel, I would only give it two or three stars, but because it fills some inner need of mine, I liked it. Not that any of the Cross books are deep, nor are they supposed to be, but this one was far more shallow. Patterson kind of jumped around and left us hanging more than he needed to. Because these books don't come out much more than once a year, I need some DAMN closure man! Work with me. Oh well, until the next one.
__label__1 Glad I Bought It: I really like this pole pruner. It looks well made, with a free edge trimming attachment, and the engine starts very easily. I have a lot of trees on my property, and it has made possible pruning jobs that I could not do before.The only problem I have is the engine occasionally stalling when you raise the pole to vertical. But if you rev to high speed before raising the pole, it works well.
__label__2 Windows 7: The book arrived in excellent condidtion and has been very helpful in trying to "unravel" some of the complexities of Windows 7. I found the accompanying cd less helpful and very simplistic.
__label__1 Deseves to be in the 50 cent Bin: Adore "The Music Man" and love Broderick (ever since "WarGames" in 1983) but he was the wrong choice for this show - despite whatever his chronological age was when he made this version, he looked way too young for the role - made me feel like I was watching a High School production of the play... and a BAD High School production at that.
__label__1 Looks like I won't finish it anytime soon: I found the reviews interesting, but I've been struggling with one page a night ... can't seem to get caught in the plot, the characters are confussing and the old English is giving me a headache. I hate not to finish a book, so I will, but it will be because I am headstrong, nothing else.
__label__1 Only made to be worn on belts: Why oh why would I be buying suspenders if I have a belt? One of my biggest pet peeves is when douchebags wear belts and suspenders at the same time; now I know those douchebags wear Perrys. I'm tall so my options were very limited, but had I known or had the description been clearer in saying "these suspenders can only be worn by douchebags also wearing belts", I'd have moved right along.
__label__2 definitely a buy: when i first started listenin i was like ok this is pretty good but then by the time the first track was halfway through i was considering it to be the best jazz ive heard in a long time u have to buy this one
__label__1 Difficult directions for a novice: I realize this is an more advanced project than the first book but the instructions are very confusing. I print in the beginning of the book is so blurred it is unreadable. I am going to give this my best shot but the very first steps are transferring the print to wood very precisly.
__label__1 Typical McRaven....: I've browsed and read thoroughly a few of McRavens books and I've noticed a pattern in regards to his work...That anyone can write a book, put a few pictures in and call themselves an author. This book is just another example of him taking just enough information and putting it between a set of covers, only to leave the reader frustrated for lack of good information. I wouldnt recommend this even to a beginner. Unless you covet disappointment. Not recommended...don't waste your money. For an informative book on the basics, projects and really good layouts, look for those by Lorelei Simms or Mark Aspery. Someone please go smash McRavens keyboard!!
__label__2 Revenge served cold: I have read a number of Jeffrey Archer's books but had never read this one, which was published back in the mid-1970s. It is the story of four men who are swindled out of a large sum of money who decide to get revenge on the swindler and hatch a plot to get their money back. The premise is great and the plot moves quickly. Surprisingly, even though it was published more than 30 years ago, the plot stands up to present day (although it clearly would involve more technology and probably larger sums of money today). It was a very quick, enjoyable read.
__label__2 Fantastic Show: OMG... This show is fantastic. I was 12 when it originally aired. I saw it then, but did not appreciate how good it was. Jane Wyman and cast are fantastic! Love this show.
__label__2 Achievement: I bought a copy of this book last month and this is what iachieved between then and now:A large Internet project, an medium scale ecommerce site and a site devoted to biotechnology articles and white papers.There is ample and valuable information in the book for programmers who have just basic HTML knowledge and C-like programming skills.I even found a chapter introducing Multi-tier programming:).Good job
__label__1 Boring: I first thought that the translation was awkward but soon realized that the characters and the story were so boring that the translation was probably appropriate. I read a lot of mysteries and prefer those that have less violence and no serial killers. In that genre I would recommend : Donna Leon, Ruth Rendell, Charles Todd and Ian Pears (the art series). A brief synopsis of this book- Kurt is frightened. He drinks coffee and worries. He drives someplace and talks to himself about his instincts. he goes to a meeting where nothing happens. I kept hoping there was a Swedish equivalent of General Patton who would slap him and suggest he "man up". I gave up on page 207
__label__1 Smells awful!: The smell of this product is not very nice at all - smells like a mixture of orange juice, milk and plastic. I haven't been able to use it much because it makes me nauseous. Consistency wise - it's fairly thick & I didn't find that it lathered very easily as a body wash. This product has been relegated to the 'use as a foot wash so we can get rid of it quickly' basket.
__label__1 I ordered a different one..: I ordered this product and ended up ordering a different one a few days later. This would not stick to it no matter what I did! It would stick for a few hours and then scare everyone when it hit the floor. I would definitely recommend anyone who wants one of these to go for a magnetic choice, as it will be much better quality!
__label__2 Good for family.: Great quality, but doesn't come with quick pull pin to fold up and it needs a a special lock to lock to hitch.
__label__2 heavy dvd: if you like your music hard and nasty this is for you! one of the best music dvd i have seen since pantera and ozzy.zakk is a fantastic guitar player and brings great players with him, this not wigger rap/rock, this is hard heavy in your face metal. if you like black sabbath, ozzy or pantera check it out.
__label__1 Terrible!: Every time I've tried to cook rice in this thing, it boils over several times, makes a huge mess on the counter, and makes poor rice. I've only tried this with standard white rice, but it's always a little crunchy, and the boiling over is ridiculous. I tried every troubleshooting suggestion in the instruction manual, but nothing worked. Now I'm saving up for a Zojirushi.
__label__1 Disappointing: This is my first purchase of a much heralded Ka-Bar, I was so excited to open the package. The knife is beautiful and feels great in my hand, the kydex sheath is also very nice. The blade came as dull as a butter knife. I had read reviews that had said that the blade may need a little sharpening out of the box, but this is ridiculous, the blade is unable to cut a sheet of paper. I am extremely disappointed Ka-Bar; the knife looks great and feels to be of high quality but a knife sold as a "fighting/utility knife" should come with a better edge than this. I was not only disappointed, but actually embarrassed in front of my friends when I opened up this very dull knife. I sincerely hope I just got a bad apple from the Ka-Bar bunch as the brand has an excellent reputation preceding it, unfortunately, I could never recommend this knife to anyone looking for a sharp blade out of the box.
__label__2 A delightful presentation of an important children's lesson.: Tailey Whaley will captivate a child's imagination. It is a colorful and interesting way to teach lessons which are vital to the healthy development their character. "Tailey" has the promise of becoming a true children's classic.
__label__2 Interesting: This movie is interesting for people who live in Princeton, MA. You get glimpses of your town, fire & police. The legend behind the movie is interesting as well. The movie is good, the ending a little dragged out. It lost me at the end, because it was so fictional. However, the parts where the true story was unfolded was interesting and well done. I live in Princeton myself and the person before who stated that this should be pulled of the shelf needs to calm down. I've only lived here a short time and I've noticed two sides to Princeton. One side- "high-class" (as they stated), snobby, rich. Other Side- Friendly, earthy, farm owners, very in tough with nature. I guess it just depends on what part of Princeton you're living in. As for the movie, well done. Making a movie must be tough & it's no one's right to make such rude comments about someone's passion and their projects. A lot of work probably went into this & I watch whenever it's aired on t.v.
__label__2 And I thought he was just a "wild and crazy guy": Bravo Steve Martin. Once he shows another side of his many talents by writing a wonderul book for light reading. This could have been written as a memoir if I was the fact that it was written in third person. The main character Mirabelle tries desperate to hold to her wits. She's trying to become a sucessful artist. Working in Neiman Marcus in the most slowest buying area in the store. She must deal with immature "maybe" boyfriends and deal with handsome, dashing men who aren't sure what they want out of life. I was really that Mirabelle didn't end it all. Instead like true independent woman of today; she survives and moves on. Hey Steve, have you started writing the screenplay to this yet.
__label__2 Good value: This rack was easy to put together, easy to move around, and held up well. Highly recommended.
__label__1 Wow just wow.: I bought this item a little bit ago. I tried cancelling my order and they shipped the order the next day. This was from AWORLDOFPUPS. I'm just saying bad service. Didn't try the item itself out yet, but the service.
__label__1 Worked great... for three months: We got one of these in late September, and were very happy with the drinks. I would usually make the brewed coffee, and my buddy became an expert at lattes that were better than anything we could get locally.Then one morning shortly after Christmas, nothing electrical on it worked - the front panel was dead. It had been fine the night before. I didn't want to fool around trying to get it fixed, so we took it back to the retailer and got something else.The instructions were definitely hard to follow, too. I never did figure out how to set the timer for brewing coffee.
__label__1 The "C" Planes: I was expecting a book on par with the work of Lloyd S. Jones' books on fighters and bombers. Unfortunately this book falls far short of that standard. While it's good to have a single source for basic information it offers little else. The photos are of poor quality in many cases and the layout makes it difficult to follow. It seems like this book was done with minimal research, many entries have nothing but basic information and the selection of photos is not very good. In short, this is not the definitive work on C planes.
__label__1 GARBAGE: First, i read Poppy in 5 grade, and i really liked it. So, i decided to read all of the books, and decided to read this book. It was so boring, and nothing realy happened that was rely intresting. To me, none of it was funny. It was boring, and it was a book that dragged on and on and on.Then, i did a book report on it, so I had to read it again, because it was a year later. WOW, was I bored. It was just realy stupid, boring, dumb, useless, and awful.So, i do not recomend this book!Read Poppy though, its amazing.
__label__1 Mondo Cane/Mondo Cane 2: The quality of the video is worse than poor. I have tried the tape in multiple machines and get poor tracking. The program is very interesting, but the poor quality over rides the benefits. I will be returning it.
__label__2 Great: Crystal clear viewing and intricate details very easy to see. I enjoy using it to look for labels, marks, and impurities in objects.
__label__1 This one really stunk: The idea of the Rex movie was a good concept but mismanaged all to hell and back. The acting was poor and I understand the actors were ashamed but my god they could have tried. The science was weak. If someone with imagination and talent had written the screenplay then actors could have let their talent soar.
__label__1 Fail: I can hear the external noises amplified through the ear piece. This product could not bite more. Do not purchase ilov products.
__label__1 Never ordered it: Never ordered itNever ordered it and I resent this way of trying to hook me into itGoodbyeSo long
__label__1 Arrived in unusable condition: Not only did the bar arrive in a tattered box, but it came missing the rubber pad for one end of the bar. This piece was necessary for use, and thus the bar was unusable and a complete waste of money.
__label__2 dougv: A useful book. The best chapters are: Tactics, Basic Endgames, and the lastchapter with sample games--excellent games to help you.One reviewer said the author's book entitled "How to Be a Winner at Chess" is aa better book. I disagree. That book has almost all general comments that anyonepast the beginner stage would already know.A book not worth buying.
__label__2 Great Time Piece: I bought this cd as a goft for my father and he loved it. Brought back memories of better days.
__label__2 Spiritual Meaning: I find Tournier's writing very agreeable. He goes into the task of seperating the personage from the person. Basing it on dialect with others and having communication with your own spiritual self Tournier provokes many interesting thoughts. A good read.
__label__2 Nice MP3 player: I like this player a lot. The video quality isn't the best available but it is good. I think this is a great bargain for the price compared to other mp3 players. I recommend.
__label__2 A very fun and funny game: When I got this it was so funny, a guy runs and makes a touchdown and he throws the ball down but it sticks to his hand. Isn't that cheating, putting glue on your hands to catch the ball,hmmm? Well not in NFL Blitz it isn't. They beat the heck out of eachother. Like Randy Moss or someone make a touchdown and dances and yells out "Whoooo I am the greatest whooo!", then out of nowhere a guy comes a tackles him, the Randy or someone would go "ooooh my ribs ah!" The game is fun too, but when you lose or your just about to make a touchdown a guy from the other team jumps up and intercepts the ball you just wan't to curse at them but remember it's ONLY a VIDEOGAME. Even though I gave it a 4, this is a must have, especially for people who like football!
__label__1 awful.....OVERWHELMED by symbolism: I too received the book for my first year writing seminar and I will describe it through the analogy of bread and butter. Consider the bread as the story and the butter as the symbolism and style that enhances the enjoyment and understanding of that story. Bread with some butter is good, the butter makes the bread taste even better. However butter with some bread is repulsive. It's hard to force the combination into your mouth and even harder to digest. The butter overwhelms the taste of the bread and you might as well not have a story at all. All that butter can clog your arteries and kill you as too much symbolism can kill a story and make it hard to read and undesirable to finish.
__label__2 caught 7 at one time!: Gross, I know, but had this trap out for about a week with PB and bread inside. Put it where I've seen the mice (kitchen). One day, came home from work, to find SEVEN baby mice inside. I let them go and put it back, only to catch another one (I think the mom) an hour later. This trap was awesome!
__label__2 Entertaining: Kick and play bouncey is very entertainting to my two youngest grandchildren. One is almost 4 months old and will smile when she sees it. Just last night we had a peaceful dinner because she was being entertained by the kick and play. My grandson is alsmost 6 months old and he has loved it for a few months now. There is a volume control for the music which is a great feature.
__label__1 Cheap Product: This product is not reliable. It definitely has problems with the 360, and moving from one selector to the other, feels as if the knob will break apart after 50 turns.
__label__2 Great Chairs - Great Price: We redecorated our home and when it came time to buy dining room chairs, our decorator wanted us to spend $800/each!!I was a bit nervous purchasing chairs based upon a picture but I have had such good luck with Amazon and there were many positive reviews I decided to go for it. I am so happy I did, chairs arrived on time, they look great, high quality and sturdy construction.I highly recommend these chairs.
__label__1 Disappointed: These dvd's are NOT well animated. They look like they were created in the early 80's. The company (Nest) is not run or owned by Christians. The company was started and is owned by a Mormon. Spend your money on Christian products. Do yourself a favor and bypass these poorly made DVDs.
__label__1 Looks good - terrible quality: I bought these to play with my son, who has just turned eight. There were two problems:1. In the picture it looks like the shuttles are different sizes, which I took as a good thing for you can then play in different humidity/wind conditions. However, all three shuttles were the same size.2. All three shuttles are now broken and we haven't played with each one for more than 30 minutes. And imagine the power of our hits - I was playing with an 8-year old. I remember playing with yonex shuttles in a club, where full-grown men would pound the shuttles for a couple of hours.Don't buy these!
__label__2 The anti-evolutionist Michael Denton becomes an Evolutionist: Michael Denton, the author of the anti-evolutionistic'Evolution: a theory in crisis' has become an Evolutionist in his newbook 'Nature's Destiny'. His new book is one long argument for the Fine Tuning Argument. But the Fine Tuning Argument inevitable implies biological evolution. And that is exactly what his previous book attacked in the most thorough scientific way. And biological evolution is exactly what he defends now, although a special sort: directed evolution. All creationists need to rethink their position now: continuing to fight against evolution or join the converted Denton with his Fine Tuning argument ? Impossible to ignore this book! gert korthof--gert.korthof@wxs.nl
__label__2 A Classic: Don't know how I worked so many years without a Sawzall.Rotating handle and flexible blades make for perfect tool control.Great for demo, remodels, and tree trimming!Takes longer to setup than to do the job!Highly recommended.
__label__1 Omega Man: I cannot use this item whatsoever. It's my fault, because I didn't notice that it was listed as HD-DVD. I cannot play this item. I will have to discardit. No one else has a HD-DVD player that I know of, either.
__label__1 Not impressed.: Was this "book" amusing? Sure. Was it a book? No. I'd call it a bound Powerpoit. And, was it helpful in the "to have or not to have children" debate? Not even in the slightest. If anything, this book just made me more confused because it drew such a definite line between breeders and non-breeders so while it's essential to be able to joke about it eventually, it's also important to actually take the debate seriously including all the ways to handle overbearing family members who may take a "sorry we've decided not to have children" not so funny. This is a serious debate and I was hoping for a little humor in an otherwise rather serious subject but what I got was a joke... making thorough fun of breeders and non-breeders alike so today I walk away more irritated from having purchased it than well informed on how to handle this decision.
__label__1 Not worth the cost: The first time I used this product it failed. I was able to add air to one vehicle tire, but the Black & Decker ASI300 stopped working when adding air to the second tire. The Black & Decker ASI300 has not worked since.
__label__2 Before buying read the title of the book: This is neither a stats 101 book for some liberal arts students not a book for advanced studies in mathematical studies.I have a degree in maths and engineering and had to learn some stats for a project I had to work on. This book was the best one I could find in the library. Easy to read with just right amount of mathematical detail.If you have a quantitative degree and you want/need to learn stats quickly this is your book.
__label__2 Never knew Oyster Farming could be so fun!: Great story of a man trying to find his place in the world. Alex O'loughlin is great as is the rest of the cast. If you are looking for action adventure this isn't the movie for you, but if you want a more love story line you will love this movie...The seen with the dog is hilarious ..
__label__1 I can't believe I was in this.: I was an extra in the movie because they filmed it at my high school, the same high school Karan graduated from. So, I bought it, of course, out of sheer excitement. Only to be left disappointed. Poor script. Poor acting. And none the less, poor movie. I couldn't even watch the whole film because of its ability to get under my skin. I'm sorry, but this is a miss.
__label__1 Destroyed my SanDisk Ultra II memory card: This card reader worked great for about year or so, then one day it corrupted all the files it transferred. Luckily, I was still able to transfer the pix directly from the memory card/camera to the computer. But THEN when I tried to use the card again, it would not work. So, it completely destroyed a SanDisk Ultra II 1GB memory card. Needless to say, I can't use this product any longer.Later, I found that it wasn't the card reader, but the Nikon D70s that was causing the corrupt files. I had to scrap the camera. I'm still using the Sandisk ImageMate, happily.
__label__2 Love my Orange Monster: I have had my orange monster for 3 yrs now. I love it. It is great. Only had one problem with it...but got it fixed. It will become a classic. I have the black monster and wish I had the red monster. Buy it while you can.
__label__2 Funny, but not quite as good as Punk in Drublic.: This is a great CD but it doesn't quit get 5 stars. This Cd has many of my favorite NOFX songs on it though. It includes my all time favorite,"Dinosaurs will die". It too has the hysterical song,"Thank god it's Monday". And who could forget that classic,"My V****a". This Cd is very good but Punk in Drublic is the best!
__label__2 this is soooooo cool: this CD is so cool! i luv every song on it! 'isreal's son' is just totally wicked, and so is 'suicidal dream', 'tomorrow' and every other fucking song on the album! you've got to get it! i listen to it all the time (like at least once a day!) and i just can't get sick of it. so buy the cd!
__label__2 ZBOARD LOTR the best ever: The keyboard is setup like the other RTS ZBOARDS. The only thing I would change would be moving the special commands from the right side to the left side, its kind of pointless to have both the mouse and keys on one side.But I just move my keyboard over, no fowl just a little bit of work:)
__label__2 Paramedic reference: Great book for interns and for any medic ... Good to use as a quick reference .. Use it all the time especially to hand to new interns
__label__2 Emilio Does His Vietnam Movie: Emilio Estevez does a fine job as both star and director of this overlooked film. His real father Martin Sheen plays his father, and watching the two together is remarkable. This movie really makes you think about what it must have been like for Vietnam vets coming home profoundly changed, to a world that didn't change along with them, and no one really understood post-traumatic stress syndrome at that time in history. And that is the legacy of Vietnam - making it home alive was not the end of the war for those who fought. If you're a vet, you'll want to see this, and you'll want your kids and parents to see it too.
__label__2 One of the best mysteries of the Fifth Season: "Detective Conan", as it is known in Japan, is one of the longest running and one of the most popular TV shows in Japan. However, it has not achieved the same level of popularity in the US by a long shot.These episodes, which have not yet been aired on US Television, are perhaps some of the best in the entire series. Taken from Volume 8 of the Manga, this 3-part mystery involves a mysterious tour at a seaside hotel, where the mysterious Knight Baron appears and attempts to assassinate Conan - but before Conan can figure out which tour member tried to kill him, the Knight Baron himself turns up dead - and Conan must again prove that what seems like accidental death is actually a murder.One of the best mysteries of the series by far - don't miss this DVD.
__label__1 Not worth the price: Not worth the price you ask? It's only $11.00. True. Don't waste your $11.00. Instead plug a shop vac into the exhaust port of the table saw. The small exhaust port gets jammed easily and if that happens, forget collecting any dust in the bag. If the exhaust port stays clear, then I'd say I collect about 10% of the dust produced. Especially with MDF. What a mess!! I built a moble stand for the saw and folding stand so I push the whole thing out into the drive way and use it out there because of the mess it makes inside the garage.The saw is great and I'm very happy with it. I gave it 4 or 5 five stars in my review of the saw itself. But this collection bag is pointless. Save your money and spend it elsewhere.Until I get my dust collector for all my tools, I use this bag on my DeWalt 2-speed planer where it works great. I empty it frequently, but that's a planer for you.
__label__2 the god part of the brain: Excellent book. I had read it years ago and listened to the author on Coast to Coast, long ago. Don't trade religion for science or science for religion. It all inter-mingles.
__label__1 Poorly transferred to CD: This is almost completely unlistenable because the quality of the CD is so poor. This is true of all the YES records. They weren't transfered to CD very well. Re-mastered versions have more recently come out. I haven't heard them, but this is not worth buying and, unlike the other single-star reviewers, I LOVED this record when I was in my early 20s.
__label__2 GORGEOUS!: Perhaps it is Phipps' virtues as a painter that invigorate these poems with so much lush color and gorgeous visual detail. Her poems are also full of music--her Caribbean lullabies and fierce stories. CROSSROADS AND UNHOLY WATER is an amazing and mature debut!
__label__1 Another Grateful Dead exploitation album: Once again, reggae musicians who are not familiar with the Dead are brought together to play their music. Considering their lack of knowledge, they do a so-so job. But the Dead's music was in the soul, man! The people who put this out are just capitalizing on the lingering longing for the Grateful Dead. Avoid this and buy Dick's Picks from the Dead themselves!
__label__1 meh: I purchased this version hoping to see some of the special features with English subs. I have not yet watched the dvd, but I was pretty unhappy when I found that the movie was just 117 minutes long, when the original was 141 minutes long. I don't see how they can take a pretty much perfect movie and mutilate it like that. Don't waste your money on this, find the original version and just live without the special features.
__label__1 Boring!: My kids and I are big fans of the original Bourne series. So naturally we were excited about this latest installment. Nope. Very boring. I understand you have to set up the back drop but boring. I will not buy this to put in our collection. Hopefully, the next one will be better.
__label__2 The best: This is a chance to evaluate Callas, Nilsson, Price, and Sutherland. Where else can you get that.I'll buy this for the 1962 Lucia mad scene with Dame Joan alone.And if you think that Dame Joan is great in that mad scene, get her DVD "The Complete Bell Telephone Hour Performances 1961-1968" and the VHS "The Age of Bel Canto". Those are Sutherland's most amazing videos.
__label__2 Awesome Camera!: I just recently bought a Canon S200 and i have to say, It's ALOT better than most cameras, even some cameras of higher MP. This is because it has a movie recording feature (yes other cameras have this too) but it records with sound! It records about 20fps and maybe lower if u record at max. resolution (640x480). The quality is great(resolution goes up to 1600x1200), it features auto focus, and for experts, you can control the ISO (theres an auto option for newbies). And the reason why I didn't give it 4 stars is becuase in movie mode, the lcd kinda blurs and gains static which is annoying and the quality on movies arn't that great. But, digital cameras arn't suppose to have superior movie qualities, that's what camcorders are for.
__label__2 Amazing movie, had to own it!: I had rented this one last year and loved it. I decided it was one that needed to be on hand. What a beautiful movie.
__label__1 Breezy and banal: 2 1/2Another set of loopy, eccentric pop becomes even more forgettable and disposable then previous outings. Worth a sampling for many of the fragmented ideas the band incorporates when playing off of different styles of music, but lacking a solid backbone to distinguish these ditties above lighthearted experimental fluff.
__label__2 Great performance: Mr Witt supplies us with some great music with a positive message. Very refreshing.
__label__1 I Didn't recieve the item: Computer Brain is the worst seller in whole world, they never shipped the product, but of course, they billed me.I'll never buy again with Computer BrainComputer Brain es el peor seller de Amazon, Amazon no deberia trabajar con personas tan irresponsables como ellos.Computer Brain nunca envio el producto, aunque si me cobro el item.Nunca compren por Computer Brain.
__label__2 Still missing a few...............: Great collection. But still does not include at least 6 titles. Rio Rita, Abbott & Costello Meet Captain Kidd, Jack & the Beanstalk, Africa Screams, Abbott & Costello in Hollywood, and Dance with me Henry. Maybe one day they will release the ENTIRE A&C movie collection.
__label__1 Junk: The one I received is not exactly as pictured ( has large seal ring ). It does not work at all and won't filter water condensate. Waste of money.
__label__1 Broken Out of the Box: Opened it up, set it up -- no sound. Sent it back. Don't waste your time on this thing; you'll only get what you pay for.
__label__2 Original and well constructed: Game is a great strategy mixed with defense. Different scenarios and strategic evaluation make it very entertaining and a lot of fun. Graphics and movies are pretty poor, but you don't even really notice.
__label__1 waste of my time: Got this book because I'd used Kaplan to study for the MCAT, and that prep program was decent. The book is riddled with mistakes; content is duplicated, some questions are wrong (greatly confusing). Expected the CD to work on Macs which it didn't. Tried using it on Windows and it would crash after every few questions! Sort of hard to gauage where you're at at all when you can't get around to the estimated score or answers!Some of the problem sections in the book seem useful, but many of the explanations for the more difficult problems are poor and, as stated, some of questions are outright wrong. If Kaplan has any errata on their website I couldn't find them.If I could go back in time I would go purchase any other GMAT prep book over this one.
__label__2 Good idea, but...: They look good. They do what they're supposed to.But it is a little difficult to get to the allen screw that holds the speaker position solid. Which is important with 15 pound speakers that you don't want just leaning into the wall.Also a hex type wall mount screw would be better for mounting to it to the wall, (I happened to have some around) as the big phillips heads supplied are tough to get into a stud without stripping the head. Even with a good predrill.These items aside they do work well and fit our needs perfectly as they are slick looking and very easy to hide.
__label__1 What a P.O.S.!: Terrible user interface - you must page through tons of cryptic menus to set basic features. Pulls multiple papers through, so you must start again. Is a G3, which you would think would be compatible with earlier non-G3 fax machines - WRONG - so you can't fax to 75% of the community that has a non G3 unit! I thought I was buying quality from Canon when I paid $250 for this hunk of junk! The cheap Brother and HP's at my work never have these problems and are easier to use, and much less expensive. Save your money and save the headaches! Sorry Canon, this product was a disaster!
__label__1 I wear a sm/med and the m/l was TOO small: runs WAY small! i ordered a size up and it was still too small for me. bust runs even smaller
__label__2 Great Movie! Highly recommend if you like this genre.: Have wanted to purchase this movie for years and finally downloaded to Kindle Fire HD. Love every aspect of this production - color, music, storyline, etc. Only wish my Kindle screen were bigger.
__label__1 UnSTINKable: As much as I admire the actors in this movie, this was a terrible production. It would have been more interesting as a book.What makes this a poor production is partly due to a significant portion of the movie being spent in a particular scene (I won't spoil it) -- at the end, the action begins, and then it's over. It was mildly interesting at best.
__label__2 Great Stretch: I love this DVD I got it out of the local library and I'm just about to order it. I've got nerve damnage in my neck and shoulder and I was looking for something to loosen me up in the morning. Wow, this is so effective. I have improved my flexibility but I've also had fun. Its very relaxing. The routines are about 25 minutes long and calming. The music is great and fits with the theme for the work out. I highly recommend this. There is alot of stretching but also some yoga poses through out the routines too. Over all its just a great DVD. Well worth the money and time. Good job Gaiam, and Madeleine Lewis! I like it.
__label__1 Shant Be Watching This One Again: Interesting footnote: My good friend Terry was the neighbor of a starving young actress a couple of decades ago who was hired to be the model whose backside you see as she's holding a knife on the poster for this film. Her name: Demi Moore.
__label__2 Perfect Satire: Ted Rall parodies Orwell's 1984 while satirizing the consumer-oriented lifestyle of the 1990s/2000s and he hits the nail on the head. Funnier than anything else I've read this year, you'll probably wince a few times, recognizing yourself or someone you know. Plotline: A Gen-X consumer in the year 2024 spends all day playing video games and buying crap online. When the chance is presented to have an affair with a higher class worker, he goes for it, until both are arrested by one of the large corporations for being selfish and hurting profits. Unlike Orwell's Winston, we never see a change in any of the characters... they're happily stupid and want to stay that way... but there's still an uncomfortable feeling when we see how close society's heading down this path.
__label__1 Do not buy this: Do not buy this junk. After just a few uses, the blender failed and would not turn on. The manufacturer customer support is horrible. They acknowledged that the unit failed, but would only replace the 4 week old blender if I paid the shipping. They do not stand by their products; if they had, I would have accepted the replacement and assumed this failure was an exception.On a positive note, Amazon return was hassle-free, and they accepted responsibility and paid the return shipping. Amazon, keep your great reputation and do not sell H.B. products.
__label__1 Terrible Product: I have had this product for almost a year and had nothing but problems with it. First of all, any time the power goes out, it takws an act of god to get it back on. I have to unplug it from the wall, pull the flash card and hold the power button for about a minute. The last time the power went out it took me about a week to get the thing started again.The slot to hold the flash card is a joke. If you don't put it in perfectly the card will easily fall down inside.The menu's are hard to navigate and the buttons you have to push to get into the menu's are not intuitive. I will never purchase another Westinghouse product.
__label__2 not as bad as people say it is: well i am not one of those who follows people blindly i hear the stuff for myself, people visualise kane as a hard spitting battle mc so he didnot cut it with this album but just listen he has made a smooth album, it just shows the mans flexibiltyif you do like BDK i suggest you add this to your collection and finish and respect the great big daddy kanePeace out...
__label__1 Ink Succubus: While it never broke, it has been retired. I was sick of its appetite for ink.It has never printed a pic worth a damn. Slower than Moses.I ran out the last ink carts on DVDs, but i always, always had to prime the old ink pump or else some color cart would be clogged and ruin the print job.I suppose if it were used every_single_day, it would be someone's cup of tea, just not mine.
__label__1 He Repeats Himself: This book was disappointing. Not a lot of new information about the DM, Zero-Point field, God, whatever. But what really felt like a gyp was that the personal stories are the same stories he keeps telling over and over again. I already read them in other books of his, and since he spends so much time telling them again, I feel like the price of the book was too much. When I buy a new book by someone, I expect new information. And he does takes way too long to make a point and relate an experience. I feel like he's got a page count he needs to reach and he'll through in any old fodder to get there. Very disappointing, Greg. You can do better.
__label__1 Meh: The ending is strange, it just sort of stops for me it left a lot of questions unanswered. ok story line
__label__1 Avoid. High frequency is terrible: I purchased 2 pair of these Motorola S805 DJ headphones. I can't believe how lousy these headphones sound. I am not new to stereo bluetooth as I have 2 Jabra sets, the 810 and 620S which are significantly better even though much older. The high notes rattle at any volume. Motorola has no firmware updates available for these.Motorola, you let me down again. When will I learn?
__label__2 Surprisingly good legal thriller!: Marty Kalish is on trial for murder, and the story is told from his perspective. In love with a married woman, Marty is the principal suspect when her husband is murdered. At first the book dragged a bit. Then once the trial started, it was hard to put down. Not the best written thriller, but oh what a ride! Very clever plot from beginning to end. I like Marty Kalish!
__label__2 Touched me in a chilling way and left me wanting more!: Drowntide is a really great adventure novel with a lot of imagination put into it. It inspired me to work on my own fantasy material! If you love the ocean and it's dark secrets, you'll be enchanted by this book. The strange beings in this novel aren't exactly mermaids, but just as mysterious and fascinating! VERY WELL WRITTEN. I'll never forget it.
__label__2 unbelievable!................: .as the owner of plush light silver carpeting and a cat that became ill with nonstop vomting for four days, I read reviews and took the shot.....with the first pass, I knew it was a great machine!.......heeding the advice of other owners, water was heated first and a scoop of Oxiclean was added to the supplied cleaner. Wow!.......My carpet was only spot cleaned for the eighteen years down in my living room; it looked almost new!........very little effort involved, go nice and slowly with it ad you too will be delighted!......easily handled, easily cleaned, easily stored.......what are you waiting for?
__label__2 Great Product!: We've given our dog Zuke's Hip Action for about two years. She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term. The Hip Action product is working for her to keep her free from pain and very mobile. It has made a great difference in her quality of life - plus she loves getting her 'treat' every day!
__label__1 Inspired writing, stupid story: I have to say that I found the imagery very refreshing, as well as the choice of words. Many times it was very nice reading. However, the story makes you wonder "so what?". This is not a thriller. This is not a ghost story. It's not fantasy. It is a stupid story told with nicely chosen words. I think that the cover is worth more than the words inside.
__label__2 Legend Of Zelda the Wind Waker Review: It Is a good game but not as challenging as the other 2 games 4 n64. But in overall I will give it a 4. But it is stilla good game.
__label__2 Just what I needed: Crazy to write a review about a toilet brush, I know... but I'd been looking for an angled bowl brush for quite some time. All the brushes on the market seem to come housed in a container that makes them look nice in your bathroom, but those brushes all seem to be the same and not all that practical. This brush is large, more industrial that your current one probably is, and got to everyplace in my bowl that the other brushes I've tried could not get to easily.
__label__2 The pest is 1 of the best movies i have ever watched: The pest is funny from the begining 2 the end. I have only watched it 2 times but i love the movie :)
__label__1 This is the worst: I bought this CD, expecting it to be in the same league as Wanda Jackson. Unfotunately, this is not the case. Comparing Janis to Elvis is a slap in Elvis's face as there is no comparison in the style or quality of the songs - maybe its irony that the one track on the CD you can listen to is "My Boy Elvis."If you want music you can listen to and enjoy get any of the Wanda Jackson offering - if you want to sit through an hour of the same miserable singing style then Janis is for you.
__label__2 Through the eyes of a child.: My 10 year old daughter read "Being A Better Me" after a socially difficult school year. I didn't ask her to read it. I just gave it to her and let her explore on her own. She never came up for air. When she finished reading the book, in one evening, she had tears in her eyes as she hugged me. She said how sorry she was for the kids who were bullying her. The book helped her to understand that the kids who were being mean have problems and hurt feelings too. Yelencsics uses easy to read dialog and situations demonstrating problem solving and conflict resolution through empathy and communication. My child has experienced an increase in self esteam just by knowing her feelings are normal and not at all uncommon. We look forward to future volumes........hurry please!
__label__2 OH MY GOSH! TATYANA ALI!: This is an excellent movie! That's probbaly why it cost so much...20 whole dollars for a vhs tape? This movie shows good acting! and it shows Tatyana Ali kissing an asian guy. So if you're asian or philipino and u like Tatyana Ali, you'll like this movie too. AND... it's also FUNNY! But about the plot... the main character,asian guy..Julian, beats up the workers at the restaurant. The script writer could have added HOW he learned how to fight like that. Julian's lucky for kissing Tatyana Ali, aint he!
__label__1 Don't waste your time!: Thanks to Hurricane Frances I was marooned in the house for four days without anything else to read, else I would never have made it to the end. Forget the editing problems, the story itself is unoriginal but if the writing was fresher it could still have been interesting. This book is basically a black version of the movie "Fatal Attraction" minus the rabbit boiling on the stove. The most promising thing about it was the first chapter, which opens with Julian being shot. Too bad it goes downhill from there. The more I read, the more I disliked him and hoped he would get his comeuppance.
__label__2 Sturdy and handy to have: This is a sturdy tool and handy to have in the tool bag. I had borrowed one from another tech on a job where we had to drill several holes in each of multiple units. The holes were three different sizes and this tool helped make short work of the task. I would recommend anyone working in the field who uses drill bits or powered screwdrivers to get one of these.
__label__1 What drivel.: As if the liberals lie more than the GOP. It's superficial, lacks any real substance, and is laughable in it's 'comebacks'. Not worth your time checking out of the library let alone $14.56 (price as of this review).I think you can tell the true value of a book is its USED sale price, there are 45 used for sale starting at eighty-eight cents. 'Nuff said.
__label__1 twice as expensive as regular coffee: I bought the toddy and am now going to return it.The coffee tastes good but the amount produced per pound of beans is so small the cost becomes very high: following directions exactly I produce 4 cups of concentrate from 7 cups of water, per 3/4 pounds of ground coffee beans. after diluting these 4 cups of concentrate 3:1 with water as instructed, the final yield is 16 cups of coffee per 3/4 pounds, or 20 cups per pound. Based on Googling the question, hot brewed coffee yields approximately 40 cups per pound. Thus, it is exactly twice as expensive to use the toddy as to make hot coffee and cool it. To me that's too much of a premium.Also, the time/energy required brewing Toddy coffee versus traditional coffee is at least 2 to 1. Here again, it's just not worth it.Finally, the cleanup is a pain.While I appreciate the product I'm returning mine
__label__2 The Second one is Even Better!!!!!: If you have not read this book, and love the edgy british "chic lit" movement, you will love this book. The next book, Something Blue is even better, and you will want to read this one first. A great new author!!!
__label__1 DON'T BE FOOLED !: Do not be fooled! This book WAS NOT written by former President Richard Nixon. It is a collection of outdated essays compiled by someone named Richard Milhouse Pfiffer. I was exceedingly disappointed...
__label__1 NO DVD: I NEVER GOT THE DVD FROM YOU I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WERE ITS AT PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPEN TO ITCwildman83@aol.comThank YouSincerly Charles
__label__1 not very impressed: After reading all of the reviews on Amazon regarding this product. Even though there were more than a few very negative ones I decided to purchase the product for my daughter. Since there were some very good reviews as well. Unfortunately I wish I would have taken the negative reviews more seriously. I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the product. My daughter didn't take to it at all. It just seemed to wind her up and then she lost interest. I think the music may be a little too much. It's pretty fast paced, and just keeps going and going and going. I like to keep an open mind with these things, but this really didn't do it for us. I'm sure we'll find something or maybe she'll be potty trained while we look for something better!
__label__2 Fine camping knife.: I bought 3 of these for grandkids and myself to use on our big adventures in the back yard and campgrounds. The Hobo is well made and opens and closes nicely. All the utensils on it are useful and the kids had to practice opening cans with the can opener. Does you kids know how to open a can without electricity?
__label__1 A Joke: I am amazed at all the reviewers who loved this rendition of the life of Elizabeth I, yet decry every other film version of her life (save Glenda Jackson's). True, Helen Mirren is a great actress and does a fine job with the material. But the interpretation of her relationship with the Earl of Essex (among other things) is ludicrous. Cavorting around with him like he is her lover? True, he was her 'favorite' after his step-father, the Earl of Leicester, but their relationship was more mother-son. I'd take Ann-Marie Duff's The Virgin Queen anyday - even with its modern touches, it is a much more accurate portrayal.
__label__1 NOT a comedy: I like Katie Holmes, and was in the mood for a romantic comedy, so I thought I'd check this out. I'm not sure why this is listed as "comedy" at all. There's nothing funny in it . . . unless you find misery, betrayal and tragedy to be funny.
__label__2 INCREDIBLE READ - just can't get enough!!: This book hands down CHANGED MY LIFE. I enjoy so many more beautiful sexy women in my life and have a deep compassionate love for all of humanity. I also never get jealous anymore in my relationships. RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE, buy this immediately before you do anything else!!!
__label__2 I love these bags can not get them in store: I love the bags they are extra big and had me feeling I could get all the junk out if you are considering these bags you must have them.
__label__2 Great book about the Fayette county area and coal miners!: Enjoyed the book so much since I was born and raised in this area!! Found out things I never knew about the valley and it's people.....
__label__1 Slightly good film from the makers of "The Toxic Avenger": Troma's previous film, 'The Toxic Avenger', was a cult hit worldwide. Troma has tried but failed to acheive cult statutas again with 'Class of Nuke 'Em High', an overlong horror/sci-fi/comedy about teens at a local high school who are contaminated by toxic waste from a nearby nuclear power planet. Some good scenes, but fails to deliver the same graphic violence as 'The Toxic Avenger' and 'Surf Nazi's Must Die'. As in all Troma films, this film is extremely long and dosn't know when to quit.
__label__1 Heavy and broke too soon: I loved the power of this dryer - however it gets VERY hot and can burn your hand if you touch the metal. Also - it is quite heavy to hold.Mine started to smell like smoke so I had to throw it out- it didnt last too long. But the power was great.
__label__1 NOT VERY STURDY: EVERYTIME WE SHOT A BASKET THE RIM FALLS OFF! I AM PLANNING TO TAKE IT BACK TOMORROW!!!!!! HOW DISAPPOINTED MY CHILD WAS. IT ALSO TOOK WELL OVER AN HOUR TO PUT TOGETHER.
__label__1 Good read but lacks references: While the book is quite interesting from a pilot's point of view it does lack proper sourcing when referring to FAA policies and/or airline policies and more. It reads like an essay from a university student who failed to grasp the notion of references.
__label__1 In the words of Dr. Johnny Fever.....: "Booger"!! I guess I'll write this DVD off. It doesn't sound worth while at all. What a shame.
__label__1 Pointless Toy: I bought this for my nine-month old because he was entertained by it in its box in the toy aisle. Upon bringing it home, I unwrapped it and found it a huge disappointment. 1) It doesn't activate very easily; you practically have to beat it with the bat to get it to wake up 2) It's pretty lame when the ball is firmly attached to the base; basically, it just teaches my son that it's OK to pound on his toys and 3) Even when it lights up on cue, it's pretty boring.We're taking it back.
__label__1 Casino Royale: I found it absolutely outragous the following:1) I pre-ordered this item mid-February and with shipping I paid approx. 10.2) It will arrive to my adress some time in April according to the most recent mail.3) Today (March 19th), I could walk into any stores in the U.K. and buy it for 9.99 - AND WATCH IT IN MY LIVING ROOM.I FEEL ABSOLUTELY CHEATED BY AMAZON - IT HAPPENED BEFORE AND I WILL NOT BUY ANY NEW RELASES THROUGH YOU IN THE FUTURE!TR
__label__2 Incredibly simple to use: I've found this GPS much simpler to use than the TomTom model I have used. My tech-challenged mom had no trouble figuring out how to use it either.It's missing some extra features, like computer connectivity and the ability to have your route played out for you before you begin your trip. Also, the search function for points of interest is very slow.But you can't beat the price!
__label__1 Pfaltzgraff Salad Plates Made in China: I like the size of the plates. I am concerned about the one I received as a replacement. It's made in China -- should I worry about lead paint? And it's much heavier than other plates. I'm not impressed!
__label__2 Celine's best yet!!!: Awesome CD!!! I love everyone of the songs. It's definitely her best ever. From I Surrender or Have You Ever Been in Love to When the Wrong One Loves You Right, I think Celine has done a superb job. No wonder she's number 1!
__label__1 Died will not hold charge: Used a few times with the SimplyVibe SV-X6U1-Black Rechargeable FM, MP3 Player and Portable and was allways dead No recommand
__label__2 Awesome!!!!: Fantastic movie!!!!! Bondurant Boys were a force to be reckoned with!!!!! Forrest was one tough S.O.B. Jack was restless and Howard just didnt give a damn!!!!! AWESOME ASS MOVIE!!!!
__label__1 Junk: First DVD I tried, "Starwars IV" doesn't work with this player (but works OK with my old player). Can't navigate submenus, and only plays in Spanish even though set for English. A second DVD I tested seemed to work OK, but the player seems to have major firmware problems, so I'm returning it.
__label__1 insane price: $20 for 12 taco shells? you can buy 20 tacos at taco bell for that price (including tax in most locales)
__label__2 Great Practical Application of Service: This book cuts through all the theory and gives a real life view of someone who is passionately dedicated to service and shows how service drives superior business. All the business theories come to life through real life examples from Carl Sewell's business experience. It is a down to earth book of how to see the true value of service to a business and how to think like a customer to deliver world-class service.Since he is the boss over his firm, there are a few things that need to be modified or adapted to fit in the corporate world to be practical.Overall, a good read. It will energize you in thinking about service as a strong business tool.
__label__2 Love the Bourne Trilogy: I really love the Bourne movies and especially the Bourne Ultimatum, so I had to order the CD. If you love these movies as I do then you'll love the CD.
__label__1 Horrible interpretation...: I'm not an avid viewer of the animated version but I saw just enough to get some context. The obvious complaint as most of you have already heard is why the change in the character's race? Usually Hollywood does this to include A-list actors in their films. Puzzling. The script was predictably campy and childish just like the show. I've yet to see a decent movie from M.Night since Six Sense.
__label__2 Ronnie Lane Fans Will Want This In Their Collection: Ronnie Lane was always my favorite member of The (Small) Faces. His most endearing work, however, was on the handful of solo albums he recorded after leaving the band and forming his own group Slim Chance. While the material on MAJIK MIJITS is not of that same high calliber, there is much to enjoy here. While Lane's MS had made it impossible for him to play bass on these sessions, Lane is in fine voice on standout tracks like "Bombers Moon," "That's the Way it Goes," "Ruby Jack" and my favorite track, "Son of Stanley Lane." Those four tracks alone are worth the price of admission. Marriott shines on the opener "Lonely No More" and does a wonderful Cockney vocal on "Toe Rag" along with some terrific guitar playing. The album closes with a rousing live version of the Small Faces' classic, "All or Nothing." RECOMMENDED
__label__1 Thank God, someone else with good taste: Glad to fine out some other discriminating viewers found this movie to be embarrassing for everyone involved, the actors, i.e, Mitchum and Winters as well as the script writer, Mr. Agee.
__label__2 Shotgun Bride: From the back cover:BACKWOODS BEAUTYHallie Benteen would never have guessed that the man who lay beside her was Ritter Sloane -- Wyoming's most notorioius gunslinger...HANDSOME HELLIONHe'd come to throw the Benteen family off their land, Instead, he saved Hallie's life...SHOTGUN BRIDECarrying her from an icy snowdrift to the warmth of her bed, he revived her the only practical way: body heat. And for that he awoke to the cold metal of a shotgun and an ultimatum by Hallie's three strapping brothers: marry her or else! Now a marriage hardly made in heaven took off in a blaze of clashing desires ... where the simple words "I do" sparked a tumultuous passion -- an untamed love as wild and hungry as their own tempestuous hearts!My Review:I loved this book. It was very fast paced and entertaining. The Benteen family was a hoot! I'm gonna have to look for the sequel Runaway Bride now.
__label__1 What Flawed Logic?? Is this same book?: I don't know where or what Paul is referring to in his review of Deere's so-called "Flawed Logic." There is NO mention of failed or incomplete healings. Jack Deere was on the phone with Dr. White giving him reasons why he did not believe in healings. And during the coversation Dr. White asked him if he believed that the Bible listed every healing that took place by Jesus or if Jesus healed everyone He came in to contact with. The answer was no. And Bible scripture is listed where if you look it up it clearly shows that Jesus healed a man while others were there that also needed healing and they were not. There are many thought provoking truths realized when reading this book. I'm sure that as a graduate of Dallas seminary those associated with the school have a hard time with this since they teach their students that Tongues ceased and so did healings and what not.
__label__2 This is possibly Elvis Costello's best work.: The songs are lovely and poignant, the music is beautifully arranged, and his voice is in top shape. This is a MUST HAVE for any Elvis fan. "Distorted Angel," and the title track are brilliant.
__label__1 Cheap coupon holder.: I hate it, the coupon separators are paper, not cardboard. It is not what I expected, I paid waaaaay too much money for something I could have gotten at the dollar store.
__label__2 Best sports game of 2003!: This game is awesome! The graphics are great and the gameplay is the best i've ever seen from a football game. There is a great dynasty mode which allows you to recruit at colleges, play you schools games, and even pick the teams you want to face on your schedule. There is also many other modes such as rivalry game, college classics, create a school, and much more. If you are looking for a good football game, choose NCAA over any other NFL game. It's well worth the money!
__label__1 This dinnerware is NOT made in England.: When I received this set from Amazon, I was extremely disappointed to find that it is made in Malaysia, NOT England. I looked at numerous pieces in the Spode Christmas Tree line at Macy's, and discovered that almost all of them are made in Malaysia or China. I believe that Amazon has incorrectly listed the country of origin as England for a number of these pieces.At Macy's I compared the coloring of plates made in England with pieces from Malaysia and China. There are subtle differences, particularly in the color red.
__label__1 Is he spinning in his grave yet?: Andromeda is just another mind-numbingly meaningless show from the posthumus Roddenberry Empire of mediocrity. I can't believe he would enjoy watching the shows that have been created in his name other than the various Star Trek series where all the money and writing talent go. I can't imagine anyone having endured Earth: Final Conflict all the way through.
__label__2 Excellent on Madison's Circle-not as great on Little Jimmy himself: Drew McCoy offers an interesting account of the last years of James Madison and his take on the politics of the 1820s and 1830s. With an intense focus on Madison's proteges, McCoy seems to lose sight of Madison and seems to see that statesman solely in the light of the coming storm over slavery and the power of the federal government. This is somewhat troubling though it must be said that McCoy's excellent sketches of Edward Coles, Nicholas Trist (if the name means anything, Trist was a diplomat who helped negotiate the end of the War with Mexico) and, best of all, William C. Rives (who really needs a modern biography) makes up for the problems. If you want a solid take on Madison's influence after his passing, "The Last of the Fathers" does well though it highlights some issues (slavery, federalism) while ignoring others (democracy, modern industrial capitalism vs. agrarianism, foreign policy).
__label__1 Akai DVDRW120: This unit records great until it finalizes the disk, at this point you can get really bad artificks and blocking with dvd stopping and hard to read.I find from the menu it is a Liteon clone for parts, so don't waste your money on this unit.
__label__2 amarte es mi pecado-/ pasion: This dvds are in good condition, I will buy again more dvds in the future. thank you, maria
__label__2 She's a real life living doll, a pinup queen & a rockabilly: diva. She really is somethin' special. I thought I was hillucinating when I saw the cover of the album. she's georgous in her bathing suit, so 50's pinup looking, and she sings like a Janis Martin style singer, and her band plays in the matter of bill Haley's comets. Really cool
__label__1 To churchy for my taste: I was hoping that this book was more nondenominational from the summary and reviews I read, but what I got seems very "evangelist preacher" to me. There are some good suggestions that I'll keep for my journey, but I was looking for somethign less prescribed. I guess I'll keep searching for a non-denominational guide to a relationship with God.
__label__1 A Total Waste!: I have a problem - once I start a book, I'm compelled to finish it. I always hope that maybe with a turn-of-the-page, it'll get better. This one didn't. Robert Slater must be Ovitz's fraternal twin. Ovitz can do no wrong. Maybe someday someone will write an unbiased account.
__label__1 Too expensive for it, misleading ads.: The ads is kind of misleading, the price could include the water bottle. I have bought two nicer stainless water bottle from ROSS for $6.49.This company wants too much profit. They probably pay these shoulder sling for $0.50. I know that, because I was a wholeseller.
__label__2 Personality Plus: I recommend this book to anyone who deals with people. In other words, everyone should read this book. I have learned so much about myself and others. This book has taught me about why people act and think the way they do. I'm only 16 and I found this book to be incredibly helpful. I think your really missing something special if you don't read it.
__label__1 Do not buy this CD: Don't get me wrong, the music is - okay. In a time when everything has become political, the Beastie Boys are no different. I was looking for a piece of entertainment, perhaps even a throwback to some good 1990's times, but instead I got political CD. If I want a political message, I'll read the paper or watch CNN.That's isn't even what pissed me off the most. I attempted to play the CD in my computer, only to find that Capitol records has placed a block that disallows this CD to be played in any Desktop or Laptop. You may read more here:http://www.gnutellanews.com/article/12729I don't have (and can't afford) a fancy home theater, so I have to play my CD's in my computer for some good sound. This is my first CD purchase in awhile - and I regret it.
__label__1 I loved Cold Mountain, but this book was a crashing bore: Every negative thing you've heard about this book is true - unfortunately. While Cold Mountain easily ranks among my Top 10 Favorite novels, this definitely ranks among my least favorite. What a disappointment. Yes, the book has it moments where the writing genius prevalent throughout Cold Mountain shines through, but those moments are few and far between. Call it the sophomore jinx, or attribute it to the fact that the $8 million Frazer received as advance quenched his creative fire. Call it what you want. This book just doesn't add up and is a waste of your time. The story line and Native American history is fascinating, but the novel meanders and plods, and just never gains any sense of rhythm or momentum. There is little evidence of the writing chops that earned Frazier the critical acclaim he so richly deserved for Cold Mountain. A shame.
__label__1 not that great...: I've owned 2 pairs of these, and they do provide o.k. sound quality for the price. However, I've since switched to another brand of in-ear headphones (JVC Marshmallow--love 'em) due to several shortcomings of this product:- difficulty in acheiving optimum sound: you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get well-balanced sound- cheap cord: it's too thin and flimsy, tangles too easily- cranial reverb: every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on- sound quality isn't really that great compared to the JVCsThere are better value choices out there; I'd recommend skipping these.
__label__2 Great for intermediate level!: After two years of consistently working out, I was starting to get bored with my usual handful of pilates and yoga DVDs. I received "Maintenance Pilates for Weight Loss" this past Christmas, and look out! This is a pretty tough 30 minute routine. Ana is great at cue-ing, but does move quickly (so beware!). Even though I like to consider myself pretty fit, my muscles were shaking during some of the moves so I knew I was really working. It's tough, but I'm looking forward to working at it until I can look as smooth and fluid as Ana does when she performs the exercises.As a side note, my mom (who has never done pilates before) tried doing this DVD with me and it was way too advanced for her. I loaned her my beginner DVDs to work with until she tries this one again.
__label__1 Misnomer: This may be entitled "Warner Bros. Classic Holiday Collection," but Warner Bros. had nothing to do with the production or distribution of Boys Town, Men of Boys Town, or the 1938 Christmas Carol. Louis B. Mayer may return to haunt the Christmases of those heretics against the one, true religion of MGM, who purloined Spencer Tracey, Mickey Rooney, and Ann Rutherford to enrich the reputations of Harry, Jack, Abe, and Ted.
__label__2 Navratilova and Nickles serve up an ace of a mystery!: Ex-Tennis pro Jordan Myles is looking for answers. She travels to south Florida, Wimbeldon, and Flushing Meadows to find out just what has happened to Audrey Armat, the best female tennis players in the world. When Audrey turns up dead, Jordan is determined to expose the killer, or die trying.A suspense-filled whodunnit that will keep you guessing up until the very end. Navratilova's extensive knowledge of tennis and tournaments make this an interesting read for enthusiasts and non-enthusiasts alike. Very similar to the "Brad Smith" tennis novels authored by Jack M. Bickham and just as enjoyable.Looking forward to more courtside suspense from Nickles and Navratilova!
__label__2 one of my fartotive sean connery movies: entrapment was one of sean connery best movies he is a master art theif and cathrine zetra jones plays gin the fbi agents when a rembrants was stolen before the new minelliuam the evdients points to sean connerychasrteters so sit back whan watch this fast placed movies it is worth the rented especially the parts about theifs and bllackmail
__label__2 No If's And's Or Butts....: Beavis and Butt-head bring classic moronity to the extreme in this 7 episode collection, which is now out of print and a must-have for any Butt Burglar enthusiast. Mike Judge is the master of stereotypes, and exhibits this skill throughout the BNB days. The "No Laughing" segment is hilarious with the in-your-face teaching style of Mr. Buzzcut, and "Manners Suck" is phenomenal when the always mellow hippy Mr. Van Driessen attacks classroom guest Mr. Manners when Beavis accuses him of abuse. "You touch my students and I'll touch you!" The fun continues when the boys go to prison to be "Scared Straight" and have a blast rocking out Iron Maiden with two thugs they think are cool. And of course the potential for moronity is boundless when Beavis assumes his Cornholio persona and disrupts the school day at Highland High. Buy this now or you have no bunghole!
__label__2 Everything and more: The Matrix has me! I have followed this trilogy since it's start and I have completely understood the meanings behind this movie. To follow it correctly you need to have seen every aspect of the story in the Animatrix, The Matrix, Reloaded, Enter the Matrix(Game), Revolutions. What a finish! The story is extremely deep and the action is awesome. This final movie left me feeling fulfilled and amazed. This story is about love, trust and belief in the greater good. This has been the best ride of my life since Star Wars! ***** Five Stars!
__label__2 Spirit of Adventure: This is an incredible album. Kim's violin technique is nothing short of phenomenal and the music is grand. Sadly you don't get to hear the Suite Sierra. Last Waltz in Bodie is simply chilling. There's a broad range of music here and it will move and shake you.
__label__2 Everclear rocks the boat: How on earth do you correctly say Art's last name? The CD is great. THe videos are even better. I'm coming out of the closet
__label__2 Typical Tamiya quality: I find this does the best job of cleaning brushes when using acrylic paints. From Testors to Tamiya paints. I highly recommend it. The bottle is a convenient size, and is easy to open.
__label__2 the eye: I really want to thank Amazon for the privledge to be able to order movies already seen by others. I really appreciate that.
__label__2 Every Barbecue Lover Should Have This Book: Cornbread Nation 2 should have been printed using waterproof paper! Reading the varied writings contained between its covers will have anyone who appreciates barbecue drooling like Pavlov's dogs.Elie has done a masterful job of assembling some of the most vivid food writing-on barbecue-imaginable. The depth of subject matter is both stunning and satisfying in what it brings to the table.It is my opinion that including Smith's Rhetoric of Barbecue treatise is alone worth the investment in this book. Often quoted as snippets in other books,here it is in it's entirety for the very first time.Quite simply, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who loves barbecue, southern culture or U.S. history. I can safely bet that once you begin reading Cornbread Nation 2, you'll find yourself becoming ravenous for some good slow cooked barbecue!
__label__2 satisfied: The "No Crank Outdoor Sink" performs as advertised. It was easy to assemble and snapped together in just a few minutes. I would recommend taking it apart and "snugging-up" all of the internal connections prior to assembly and installation to insure no unwanted leaks. The Water Powered Retractable Garden Hose Reel is a "Godsend" for a 70-plus year-old who has difficulty cranking in a bent-over position. I am satisfied with it's performance and would recommend the "No Crank Outdoor Sink Station" as a useful and convenient addition to any backyard.
__label__1 Sew Baby Doll Clothes: I was very dissappointed when I received the book. There were no patterns included and that was the reason for purchasing the book.
__label__1 Not one for the ages...: I have a vague memory of having seen this film in the theater after it came out and having left it feeling like Kevin Smith had touched my soul. Perhaps it was because I too had been "Involved" with a couple of "Lesbians" in my college years and felt the film somehow spoke to me. Some years later I rented this one again, having just seen Clerks again recently. Let it be known that I belive Clerks is pure genius. Chasing Amy was painfull to watch. The dialogue comes off as though it were written by a high-school sophomore and made me wince on at least one occasion: during the Coming Out seen when Amy is sitting on the tire swing and describing how her friends pleasure each other. It has a few moments, but Chasing Amy will not make it in to my DVD collection next tomy copy of Clerks. I find it somehow fitting then that I have found out that the "Lesbians" I knew in college are now married (to Men) and having kids and going to being wifey.
__label__2 Powerful: This cd helps evoke the importance of music in the fight for civil rights in the South. I would suggest this work to anyone who desires to understand the unspoken history of the South and the full push toward equality with folk's special place in history.
__label__2 Not just YA!: The Sisterhood was one of the best books I read last year, and the sequel is no disappointment. I've recommended these two (and given them as gifts) to people who are way past their teen years, and they love them as much as I did. Definitely read the first one first.
__label__2 always love Dickens: he has such a way of describing. one of my favorites authors of all time. great to have access to classics
__label__2 Very useful: I used this tape to keep a futon mattress from slouching when it's upright. I also considered using to stick kids to the ceiling.
__label__2 Broad View of Communications Changes: Williams says the communications revolution is ultimate a social one. He identifies it as an "explosion" in technologies. We are in the process of adapting to changes in the environment brought about by these technological advances he argues. He accurately tells us life will never be the same again. Distance is becoming a factor that no longer matters as technology brings people closer together. He writes "Where you dwell will be irrelevant to everything except your direct physical needs which, of course, include access to communications networks" (p. 18). He emphasizes the importance the "knowledge worker" will play in the unfolding generation. These changes are rapid, he says "We are on a social acceleration curve" (p. 35). While some of the technologies he describes are already passe, the general argument he makes is still worth consideration.
__label__2 Please Read the Book Before Criticizing: Mr. Phillips book is well-researched and carefully written. And whether one agrees with him or not, a customer-reviewer at least owes him the effort to actually read the book before criticizing it. Careful scrutiny of most of the one- and two-star reviews posted on here strongly suggest that his worst critics have not got past the dust jacket. A one-star review begins: "I didn't buy this book, but browsed it at our local Borders, so perhaps I missed a few points." Another reviewer worries about the influence of Carl (sic) Marx. Mr. Phillips is also subject to ad hominem attacks for being associated with Richard Nixon 30 years ago or for having written another book 12 years ago that some reviewers didn't like. Wealth & Democracy should be thoroughly read and then carefully critiqued, not blasted with emotional invective that adds nothing to a genuine debate about the book's ideas.
__label__2 Metal Forever!: This documentary is one of the best I have seen on the genre of metal. Definitely worth the money. The only problem I had with it is that for being brand new DVD's, some of them skipped even though there were no scratches whatsoever.
__label__2 We Want Hooks!: Why is it that out of all the songs they play on the radio NONE have any decent hooks?The whole POINT of Top 40 radio is that it's supposed to be accessible. And yet so much of it is dreary and boring.Fountains of Wayne makes music that is ripping up the Top 40 charts in some more fortunate alternate dimension. The mainstream radio channels in that universe play songs that you actually want to sing along with in your car, and Matchbox 20 is but a dream. Fortunately the lyrics are as good as the tunes. Most deal with the day to day struggle to find love and meaning while working at a job you hate in a world that makes no sense. Sort of like Radiohead after prozac.
__label__1 Slow, cumbersomes and boring presentation: Frankly, I was very disappointed. The book was difficult to read and hard to follow. Several times throughout I felt that information was restated over and over, not for clarity, but to fill pages. Much of the book was too boring to read through completely. This book was written so poorly as to cast a doubt on the validity of the potential problem it is trying to report on? I wish I had not purchased this book and could get my money back. There are probably better books out there which explain the Y2K problem.
__label__1 Good book: Dont waste your time or money if you have'nt read the other books, book realy did not tell me anything that was helpful in the use of the calculator.
__label__2 This is the best software book I've ever read.: And I've read a lot. I've been using Photoshop for 12 years or so, and I only with I'd read this book years ago. This is an extremely practical book with "Pearls of Wisdom" that are just that. The book is filled with little tips that will change the way I work with Photoshop. Thank you, Deke!Scott See
__label__1 No customer service: The speakers stopped working after 4 months and then the customer service was terrible. I couldn't get a hold of anyone. Don't buy unless you want your speakers to break and then not have anyone help you!
__label__1 One of the all-time worst movies!!: A root canal would have been less painfull. I immediately went back to my video store and requested a refund. 1 star is way too generous.
__label__2 The Best!!!: I own this DVD thanks to my son who had imported to me as a gift in 2007. I have seen them in concert twice. The first time they came to USA was in 2007 very near to my home in Ky. The 2nd Time we saw them we drove over 700 miles to see them in NYC in Sept 2011. It was the best ever!!!! Sharon and Robert were seen on the streets of Manhattan just hours away from the concert time and my son was lucky enough to get his pic taken with them.
__label__2 Lovely stuff...: Spokane's 'Measurement' is a beautiful and subdued album. Their sound is built around restrained and somber boy/girl vocals, subtle string parts and gentle shades of piano and guitar. Labradford's Robert Donne also contributes bass guitar on this their third album giving it a warm and steady foundation. Definitely worth investigating if you are a fan of Low, Kepler, Codeine, Windy and Carl or even shoegazer bands like Slowdive.
__label__1 So bad its unreadable: This book is so bad it absolutely unreadable. Anyone failiar with The Foundation series would not recognize this book.An utter waste of money and time spend grinding through each page of innane dialog.thats all I have stength for this book is a POS.(if I could give it a lower rating I would)
__label__1 It's unknown to me why this terrible cliche of a film was ever made: Totally retarded, "I've got amnesia, people are out to kill me, who am I and how can I stop this insidious plot that I'm starting to unravel" type of a film. Incorporates elements of the Bourne trilogy, Memento, Salt, some of those stupid Tom Cruise movies, etc. Dumb dumb dumb.
__label__1 This video is for Beginners: The video was informative but a little cheesey. A good thing about it is that the video gives some useful web sites. The length of it was a little too long. The opening idea of holding hands was a little childish and overall it was boring. The graphics on this video are weak, the pictures too small and the same for the text. In my opinion it was too basic. I would not recommend this video for the adult level audience.
__label__1 Too Tedious of a read: Couldn't wait for it to end....it was pure drudgery for me...but it was Tolstoy, right? :)All the Russian names were confusing, and they changed what they called each other....my goodness.The love story was good, but all the detail about Russian life in the wheat fields and such was just too much for me.I made my way through it, but it wasn't a pleasurable read...well a few parts weren't bad, but for the most part, I didn't like it.
__label__1 Takes itself too seriously: Roofworld is very frustrating, in part because it could have been so much more. The protagonists are poorly constructed and the concepts, while great, do not take flight. The secondary characters in Roofworld form a freak show and the Roofworld's `Ambassador' is not introduced for some time - and then only as a shrivelling, pitiful character as the street world's main character. A few action sequences where we never get to fixate on one particular person makes this a very limp narrative.
__label__2 Hairspray: The best movie I saw in 2007. John Trovolta added alot to his character.Much softer than the original. My grand children loved the DVD, they rangein age from four years to 22.
__label__1 Worked for 4 years and then loud buzzing sound and blown my speaker fuse: Loved this product for 4 years until it suddenly started buzzing (really loud!) and it also blows the fuse of my speakers too. I thought power strips lasts forever. Had to switch back to a regular power surge strip -- painful to turn off my PC, speakers, monitors one by one but had this older strip for much longer than the SCG3. It was also cheaper too.
__label__2 The best sounding CD in years: Having followed Nils Lofgren's career since my college days in 1972 I have always found him to be innovative, talented, & funny. I never could understand why someone who put out an album as good as All Out never really made it on his own. This new album showcases his talent as a guitar player and songwriter. In addition the production on the recording is flawless I have listened to this album many times and have bought 6 copies to distribute to my friends everyone I have given it to has been blown away. Buy more than one copy and give it to someone you love.
__label__2 Great service and product for the money: I've used this vendor twice for Waterman pens. I'm very pleased all the way around.
__label__2 Price was right: This works just fine to connect printer to desktop. The price was right at about $5, cheaper than anywhere else.
__label__2 Unibrain 1394 Firewire 10M Cable: Works as advertised. Do not add any more nodes on the run. 10 meters is really MAX.
__label__1 Rather disappointing: After a great start, this 2nd book is a major disappointment. Most of the interesting parts are given past tense, and basically dont hold any interest.... Sorry Dave, you didnt reach your usual standards on this one...
__label__2 Dry bag is Great: I purchased this item and another of a different size for my daughter and son-in-law who go canoeing regularly. They love these bags. The larger size is great for the stuff they need for the day; the smaller size is perfect for her camera. They especially like that they can see what's inside the bags. Highly recommend these products.
__label__2 A great father's day gift!: I bought this watch for my husband for Father's Day this year and he loved it! Great price for a great watch.
__label__1 Price makes it unaffordable: For a 200+ pages book, the price is exhorbitantly high which will make it unaffordable to the many millions who want to read it, I for one have heard a lot of praise but unable to buy it. There must be somebody out there, who is either very greedy to make money or believes its counter-productive to his interests and therefore deliberately prohibits it's reach to the masses.
__label__2 Valuable Study Resource: This book is the perfect companion for one's studies of the Book of Daniel in Scripture. Clarifying gray areas which can be difficult to grasp, I consider this book a definite assest for anyone truly interested in a thorough study of Daniel, and definitely would recommend it as a valuable resource.
__label__1 Makes a Toddler Want to ...: Do you parents really want a good game that is "edutational" for your children? This is NOT the one. I did not try this game, but I know that ....How, you ask? I read a review. You can take one look at the graphics, and tell. Listen to me, because this will help in the long run.Bottom Line: this game is so bad, a toddler might stop watching Dragon Tales because of it. You'd better get Sesame Street.
__label__1 Frustrating Beyond Belief: This game was extremely frustrating. As one reviewer pointed out, you must switch between Quick Time 4 and 3 to be able to begin to use the game. Furthermore, even after doing that, I had additional problems with DirectX. After hours of communication with The Learning Company to resolve these problems (unless everything is set up perfectly, there is no way to find companions to start the game), TLC simply refered me to the manufacturer of my computer. Extraordinarily poor design and follow-through. My computer is a relatively new HP 4445 that far exceeds the recommended needs to run this game, yet nothing works.Simply put, do not buy this game unless your idea of family fun and education consists of repeated and futile exchanges with the consumer service division of The Learning Company.
__label__2 Wonderful edition to my hello kitty collection!It's so cute an: It's so cute and adorable. I can't speak to how durable it is, since I don't plan on playing with it or sleeping with it, I am keeping this item in pristine mint condition. But it's wonderful to look at and have in my collection.
__label__1 Worthless: I bought 4 of these plus 2 of the ones for the TV. Waste of money they are, especially if you have a TV that curves, where they can get their fingers in the sides. For the vcr, my 2 year old son just pulls the top and reach in. If anything it's a pinching hazard. Toys r Us use to carry a VCR guard that fit into the opening of the vcr. I used that one when my daughter was younger, she's now 4, and even now they can't open that kind because it requires sliding a button while holding an alternate side, something she can't do even at 4 going on 5. That one is made by Safety 1st and you can find it on the internet. Don't waste your money on this!!!
__label__1 From Potential to Bad: I have never written a review of a book, game or movie but I feel compelled to write this. I must loudly echo the majority of reviews of this book. The Last Templar had a great deal of potential at the beginning of the book. It was exciting, good premise and potentially strong characters. However, after the first strong 74 pages or so, it progressively began its downward spiral into c*&p. Please, be careful when deciding what book to read next as I do not recommend this book. P.S. - the 2 stars are for the beginning of the book.
__label__1 poor quality / workmanship: i ordered 4 sets...when we got them in we washed them and they unravelled around the edges - so i sent them back and the second set did the same thing..so i am returning them for a credit to my card...sorry for the bad news...
__label__1 get what you pay for: Totally agree with the first review here. With only one heating element on the top and bottom, it's really impossible to get things toasted evenly. Things come out with a toasted line right above/below the element, and the rest is untoasted. Or if you leave it in longer, you get toasted on the edges and burned in the middle. Would much rather spend twice the money to get something that toasts better.
__label__1 HP Support is BAD//This printer won't work with my msworks!: When I went to use this printer with MS Works, it shut down that application with the message "out of memory." So, I tried HP chat...took her about 30 minutes to warm up to trying anything. So, she is so slow (I mean minutes between sentences), after about forty minutes, I called HP while I'm waiting on chat. They first try to tell me it's a Microsoft problem. I say no. The only problem is that your printer doesn't work w/Works. (Works prints with other printers.) I told her what the error message was. She forgot. Meanwhile, I'm almost an hour and a half on chat w/NO results. This printer does not work w/MS WORKS! And - HP tech assistance is DEPLORABLE. Truly. Bad.
__label__2 Ugly vampires: At first I was so caught up with the characters in the beginning that I even forgot that it was a vampire movie. But boy was it ever a vampire movie, expect for the ladies dancing before they turned, and even them after they turned, it had to be the ugliest vampires I have ever seen! My favorite part is when Salma Hayek came out and was dancing, and then what a scary monster she turned into!
__label__2 Excellent Speakers!: These speakers are expensive, but the sound quality is indeed exceptional and makes them worthwhile in my opinion. The 5 series speakers can put out a tremendous amount of sound, I currently have them set at about 8% volume, and turn them up to about 20% of their capacity if I want to hear them throughout my entire apartment. Highly satisfied with Bose sound quality. As an additional note, I bought the Bose Companion 3's and they are OK for a small room, have excellent style and very form factor, but put out just over 1/3 the breadth of sound as the Companion 5's. My suggestion would be to skip the 3's and go with the 5's.
__label__1 Large amount of space, but might not always work: This Gamecube Memory Card appears to have everything: Decent price, huge storage space, Nintendo branded. However, many people are having issues with the Nintendo Wii correctly reading it. That's not to say it doesn't work for everyone, I'm sure there are cases out there where it does. The internet seems filled with cases like mine, however. When you go to save a game on it, Gamecube games on the Wii do not recognize the card.
__label__1 As the old saying goes: I'm getting too old for this...record. Would have loved it as an attention starved teen. Download "Novocaine For The Soul" and move on.
__label__1 Doesn't last very long: I bought one of these about six months ago, because it looked like a reasonably-priced digital scale without any unnecessary bells and whistles.About two months later, the scale simply stopped working. If I stepped on it, it acted like it was working but after five cycles through the display, it just displayed an error. This happened over and over, and I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash.Being a naive and ever-optimistic soul, I bought another one. Now, after a few months, it takes me between three and ten tries before I can get a reading out of it; mostly it cycles through its "working" display before giving up and giving me an error. Some days I just can't get it to work at all.When it works, this is a nice scale... it seems to be accurate, the display is easy to read, and it just generally does what it's supposed to. Based on my experiences with its reliability, however, I would not recommend this scale to anyone.
__label__2 Excellent: I bought 3 music blu-rays, I thought this one was the best of the three.It feels as if you are at the concert itself. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Fairly Lame Attempt to compete with Garmin Nuvi: Just the same device with a couple of new tricks. The internal battery is a nice feature. If your looking for a multimedia gps, you must check out the Garmin Nuvi. It is half the size of the 800 and weighs half as much, about the size of a deck of playing cards. Garmin's mp3 is integrated with the gps so it mutes the mp3 when giving a voice comand, just like a built in system. The Garmin unit is $150 less expensive than the bulky roadmate. Also, you can add real time traffic updates to the Garmin unit with an antenna and a subscription.The Garmin Nuvi is also a multi language translator that can help you travel in strange lands. With their guidebook feature, you will know all the sights to see and places to stay. All in a package about the size of a deck of playing cards. Don't waste your money on the Magellan. Its already obsolete.
__label__2 Actully I've never seen it: Ok so I've never seen the video but ya know what I don't care. I've been a SUBLIME fan for about 2 years now, I have all their albums and am planning on prdering the video today but I can safely say that EVREYTHING Sublime dose is wonderful. They are probly (at least in my opinion) the best band this world ever had the pleasure of listing to even in the short time they were around. Anyway if you decided to read all of my little rant i say to you- If you are a true SUBLIME fan you MUST get this video I've heard from my friends that it is one of the coolests things have in their Sublime collection so d yourself a favor and just GET IT!
__label__1 uncomfortable, heavy, feels bulky & doesn't hold much: I use a lightweight laptop for portability & so I like backpacks to be comfortable and light. Somehow it feels like quite a load when carrying it & people have commented to me that it even "looks heavy". It also feels rigid and bulky and it barely holds more than a laptop and power cord. On the other hand with all that bulk, there's no doubt it will protect your laptop.
__label__1 Stay away from savage harvest!: The only part of this movie that was even worth watching was the shotgun blast to the head scene.The meltdown part was only alright.If you want to see the only true gore film,in my book it's Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.Savage Harvest looks just plain pittiful next to that.Or even Bad Taste(also by Peter Jackson.)Besides the gore this movie had extra terrible acting.Not cheesy.Cheesy can actually be fun.(Note,Dead Alive.)And also I say they should've saved up some more money for a better camera,and lighting,and ACTING CLASSES! With only a slightly below average story,all it really lacked was some originality and creativity.Duh look over there behind those boxes.Oh dear,look,it's a scary demon.Oh look a screwdriver.I'll jam it in it's forehead.Oh look i did.If your gonna do something do it well WATCH PETER JACKSON MOVIES.GET CREATIVE!The real score is zero stars.
__label__2 A Book For Everyday!: ...Once again Scott compiled a fine work that covered all areas. Covers things such as: Ritual of Eating, Food Magic, & Festival Foods. Covers food then in catagories: Breads/grains, Cakes, veggies, fruits, herbs/spices, dairy, etc...etc...in these sections each item is descibed, the lore is given, magical uses, ruling planet and element, and the energies (eg. peace, healing, love etc...) Then there is over 60 pages of magickal diets. (love, protection, money, sex, etc..) Wonderful useful tables and mail order sources lastly. This book couldn't get anymore useful! I keep mine right with my cookbooks in my kitchen, like a good kitchen witch!
__label__2 Memorial Day is great.: Vince Flynn makes you feel as if you are right along for the ride when Mitch Rapp takes on a terrorist. Great book.
__label__2 Part Two of a very easy order: Everything from setting up an account, to ordering, purchase, and delivery was so easy. Was very surprised at the quality of sound on both Jim Reeves and the Webb Pierce CD's. Have ordered two more "older" CD's for Fathers Day. Now I will have to start looking at and ordering CD's from "my era" - the 70's.
__label__1 Broken upon receipt, but fast easy return: Upon reciept of this unit, I had a hard time setting the clock as the buttons would not seem to work quite right. I replaced the batteries, and still had issues. When trying to set the alarm time, I realized if I squeezed the plastic on the exterior with slight pressure, the times would change without pressing buttons. I returned the product immediately
__label__1 DO NOT BUY!!!: The previous review is obviously from the seller. This thing is a piece of garbage. There is nothing commercial about the quality of this. My clothes are bending the pole and the extensions can't hold more than 5 or 6 lightweight shirts. I wouldn't have paid half the price if I had seen it first. One more thing- the wheels in the photos are not what you get. You get cheap plastic wheels that do not roll well and will break. Save your money. (I don't know if the seller would take it back or not so I can't comment on their reurn policy. I'm too lazy and don't have the time to mess with the aggrivation.)
__label__2 works well...: I received the item quickly, and was extremely pleased. The item is as good as anything you would pay more for at a chain pet store. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this seller again.
__label__2 Easy decorating for beginners: This book is full of great ideas for kid birthdays. I am a novice cake decorator and these recipes made it very easy to create a homemade cake that looks great. My 3 year old loved the racetrack cake. I highly recommend this book for beginners like me.
__label__2 This is "Happiness".: I'd imagine the majority of fans would have been happy with just a single disc hits album, but everything here is wonderful, and more is better right. Of course the first disc here is all the best, minus a song or three. It includes "Fuzzy", "Homespun", "Truly Truly", and probably their most popular song "Mockingbirds". I'm also glad it has "Honey Don't Think". The second disc is all b-sides and extras, and for the most part, nearly as good as the first disc. None of it really stands out to me yet, but it's all far from filler. As with any "Best Of" album, this is a great collection for the newcomer, and also should appeal to fans of the alt-country scene, etc.
__label__2 i still Jam to this Tape: I have had this tape for years. got it from a Fellow Funkateer Buddy who was also a big Cameo Fan. the title track was my jam. the Synth New Wave groove was banging. Your Big Behind Makes Me Blind,your the most. that chorus was crazy and wild. Flirt was Funky with the Guitar in the background and the trademark cameo funky Punchy Bass Groove. but my main cut on this Album was "be Yourself" with the Bass Leading Groove and the Vocals were on point,but the Lyrics were strong and felt in my hood as well.always be yourself and do your thing. the Message was loud clear and Funky. the vocals were Funky as well.
__label__1 When the basics are wrong, what _can_ you trust?: After looking carefully at specific aspects of this book, I'm not only able to agree with the other reviewers about the problems they found but also can identify two very fundamental flaws: 1) Hensperger gets the "order of adding ingredients" backwards for the Zojirushi. Did she get the others right? 2) In many recipes she says "unplug the machine" at one point or other in the process, making it very clear that she's not familiar with how machines work....or the simple expedient of pressing the reset/cancel button to achieve the desired effect. When an author is so far off on basics like this, there's no point in wasting time finding out about the other mistakes, or in wasting money on the book. There are number of bread machine books out there that give the diversity of recipes Hensperger attempts, and do a far better job.
__label__1 Learn in your car Spanish: Very boring, listen to spanish words and repeat. If it wasn't for environmental concerns I'd sail this CD out the car window.Mike
__label__1 Man, that is jacked up!: This movie is HORRIBLE (the shows were horrible). It was a bad attempt to resurrect Ninja Turtles. First off, the Ninja Turtles had only 4 turtles, and the idea of a girl turtle is just stupid (not that females are bad, it just ruins the Ninja Turtles). I am a teenager and I was an avid Ninja Turtle viewer and I love the Ninja Turtles, but when they remade it, that changed everything and it made it dumb. It insults my intelligence and everyone who watches it becomes dumber.
__label__1 Uncomfortable with lacking sound quality: I was given these for Christmas, so I can't complain too much, but I wanted to post a review so people won't spend their own money on these things.The clip-on mechanism is uncomfortable no matter where the telescoping arm is set on my ears, and after about a half-hour of wear, they begin to hurt to the point of me not wanting to wear them. The idea of clip-ons makes sense I guess, but the cord is constantly tangled and it's not a very secure fit.As far as sound quality, these are somewhat "muddy" sounding headphones. While I'm no audiophile, I am not impressed *at all* with quality.I already ordered a set of Koss Portapros to replace these. It seems that a little bulkiness is worth it over these things. Even Grados SR-60s would be a better buy.
__label__2 Don't Mess With The Dragon: "Don't Mess With The Dragon" is Ozo's latest full-length studio album. I hesitate to call it "full-length" though, since it clocks in a just over a half-hour long. But I'd rather have a compact, tighter album than an overly long, drawn-out, watered-down 75-minute affair.I would agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't Ozo's best album. But it is still solid. It's upbeat and fun. Don't Mess with the Dragon is a party album, a feel-good record.One complaint - the rapping is below average and has been for quite awhile now. They could really use a guest appearance by Chali 2na, of Jurassic 5, again. I could do without rap on any future Ozo albums.Overall though, it's not mind-blowingly great, but it is good. And it's way better than 95% of the other new music you could be buying. So pick it up. It's hard to sit still and be unhappy when Ozo's coming through the speakers.
__label__2 Color Description Misleading: I have an olive skin tone, so finding a base color can be tricky. This color is supposedly for those with golden or olive skin, but what I found out from a representative at a local makeup store (after trying and HATING this color) is that the "golden" color line was created for people of Asian descent, so the Golden Medium base made me look like I had a nice case of jaundice. Generally I love BareMinerals products, this was just a bad description for color matching purposes.
__label__2 tools and accessories: I got these for my brother to use in making his guitars. He has used them before and chose these for me to buy for him. Having owned a cabinet shop for deecades he knew the product. so far, so good.
__label__1 ...OUCH!: These shoes are adorable, but they HURT! My feet were killing me within ten minutes of wearing them. I'm a teacher who is constantly on my feet, and I was excited to get Naturalizers, which are supposed to be made for comfort... not successful! I have tried to "break them in," but the fact of the matter is, they just hurt!A cute pair of shoes if you don't plan on doing a lot of walking, but not very functional. Try Aerosoles instead; I've had great luck with their heels.
__label__2 This is my favorite cd in the world: This cd is amazing! It is too awesome to put into words. It is not only relaxing a calm, but the lyrics are so ingenious and so meaningful, that I just can't get enough of it. You will want to listen to it over and over again! You absolutely need to buy this cd! You will not regret it. You can listen to is anytime: when you're sad, happy, moody, depressed, or even on a romantic date. Happy listening!
__label__1 lasted about 6 months: While it worked, it worked great. But, after about six months, it would no longer stay closed and all the loose leaf tea would just come out. Mine never rusted in those six months, though.
__label__2 Good lens cleaning tissues: I used to get these Bausch & Lomb Sight Savers at Costco, but they stopped carrying them - replaced them with another brand that is not as good. I'm very pleased to find that the B & L Sight Savers are still available on-line.
__label__1 Not for bunnies: My bunnies couldn't get the hay through the bars. It was torture for them, seeing the hay but couldn't eat it! Maybe this is for smaller animals.
__label__1 Worthless replacement battery, didn't last a year.: I paid for the Makita name on this battery, and it was headed south within six months and useless after a year -- and I'm not a heavy user, just a normal household kinda guy. Save your money.
__label__1 Great Sound BUT Broke in a MONTH: Buy the 51LP, those last longer, not sure about white ones, but my friend has a 51LP black one that he has used for a year now, I checked it out, the wires are better as in tougher and there's a plastic clasp holding the wires together instead of a sharp metal one that comes with this product, plus the wires for this product are not tough, instead they are nice and soft which is meaningless to me for earphones. I don't care if my earphones' wires are nice and soft, make them tough instead.
__label__2 For math thinkers maybe: There seems to be a cultish following for Polya's book, so I decided to pick it up even though I'm not a mathematician. I'm a philosophy PhD with an interest in "business strategy" (as they call it). The book's a little bit tough to move through, since he chose to write it as a glossary for the bulk of the text. That makes it boring. The more fundamental issue of course is that he's thinking about math when he gives his ideas for solving problems, and more specifically about TEACHING kids to solve math problems. Now, this is useful. And the general tenor is applicable to all kinds of problem solving. But I think it's not the holy grail it's meant to be -- there are other books on problem solving that make more practical sense if you are working on non-formal mathematical puzzles.
__label__1 Agree with everyone else: I have this chair for over 2 years and i admit that it's been in my bedroom just for decoration after the very 1st week of use. I agree with everyone else who said it more vibrates than massages...
__label__1 Cheap PoC: This router is slow and unstable and I had DHCP IP-address issues with it (both wired and wirelessly and with both Windows XP and Vista). The price is right but you definitely get what you pay for with this PoC. Save yourselves some heartache and get the Linksys WRT54GL (and load Tomato). This thing was nothing but trouble (mine was hardware revision D1.1R and came with the latest firmware (v3.00 build 0028)). I have since returned it.
__label__2 Comforting: Joyce Meyers has a way of addressing a person's problems in a clear and concise manner that makes God's message easy to understand.
__label__2 Josh Groban, What a voice.: Once again fantastic. His voice is amazing,I could listen to this cd 24/7. I don`t think you could go wrong with any of his music, he just keeps getting better and better and to think he`s really only just begun.
__label__1 I RATE THIS MOVIE AS 0 STAR: THIS MOVIE I SAW WHEN I 1ST CAME TO CHRIST AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES THIS MOVIE SHOULD NOT EVEN BE LISTED AS A CHRISTIAN MOVIE! I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS 25 YEARS OLD AND NOW THAT I'M THIRTY ONE I STILL DON'T LIKE IT. MAINKY FOR A PERSON TRYING TO PREPARE THERE SPIRITUAL LIVES. THIS MOVIE MAY MAKE A PERSON STAY IN THE WORLD. ONE THING YOU CAN LEARN FROM THE MOVIE IF YOU DON'T FALL FOR JESUS CHRIST YOU WILL FALL FOR ANYTHING AND BE DECIEVED AND YOUR CHILDREN TOO! PLEASE FOR CHRIST SAKE SPEND YOUR MONEY ON AN UPLIFTING MOVIE ABOUT THE WORD OF GOD! AND I HOPE TO GOD THAT NO CHILDREN ARE OR WILL SEE THIS SICK AND TASTELESS MOVIE!----------LOVE YOUR SISTER IN CHRIST!
__label__1 A Classic In It's Time, But . . .: Anybody's Bike Book was a classic in it's time, but there are much better books out there today.I work on a lot of bikes and recently reviewed a bunch of bike repair books for a class I taught. I would recommend the Park Tool "Big Blue Book of Bicycle Repair" or "Zinn and the Art of Road/Mountain Bike Maintenance" over this book, even for a beginner.
__label__1 Avoid this popcorn: After making several batches using different techniques I can only get 50% of the kernels to pop. I used a different brand of kernels with much better results. The only conclusion I can come to is that these packages are stale. It doesn't help that there is no expiration or manufacture date listed anywhere on the packages. I would recommend to not buy this product.
__label__2 Bought Open Box at Best Buy: Love this DVD player - plays all by backed up avi's - i can burn them right to a cd and it plays them. The quality is outstanding, upconverting looks great - not HD, but for the price this has got to be one of the best deals out there.
__label__2 Good writing, occasionally great: This book took about a hundred pages to hook me. That seemed like a long time. But I'm 250 pages in now, and can't put it down. The writing has just enough chess specifics to interest me, a little too much ancient history for my taste, but not so much that I can't get through it. And just when I think the author is going to stumble, he comes up with a few sentences like these, describing the New York Open (page 220, paperback edition):"The ballroom was loosely ornate. The carpet attempted a hybrid of fashion and fire codes, and a grand piano had been rolled off into a corner as punishment for irrelevance. A complex of chandeliers shed off the kind of diffuse incandescence that might equip a high volume morgue."
__label__2 LITHIUM BATTERY: Since I just purchased this battery to go with my Dakota Driveway Alarm, I an unable to rate it as to battery life or anything else. I gave it an original 5 Star rating because of the brand name.
__label__1 Very Very Disappointing: This is less a book about the French paradox than it is a book on how to count calories. Thanks but I didn't need to spend money to figure that out. I wanted to know more about the French approach to eating, which he only briefly covers. His 22 secrets to the French diet include such worthless memes such as exercise more. Novel! He spends a lot of time telling the reader that low-fat diets are worthless, but a bunch of recipes include low-fat and low-cal substitutes. That's a fine approach, but not one the French would use. So he should have just named this book "How to Eat Lite with semi-French recipes". I would not recommend this to people who want to eat like the French because while some of these are covered, it's not all that hard to look them up on the net. You're better off researching on your own and spending the money on a real French cook book.
__label__2 Avalon does these Hymns justice: I love Avalon's take on all of these songs. Every track is blessed and I thought the group was excellent on their rendition of these legendary hymns. God bless Avalon.
__label__2 An excellent value: This binocular for astro-viewing is an excellent piece of equipment priced very low. The weight of the binocular is not very high and if you are star-gazing continuously for a long time, you may take short breaks after 10 or 15 minutes to rest your hands.This binocular is easy to use that small kids can take a peep into the celestial spectacles and get interested in astronomy. For those in the 7th decade of their lives--seniors like me--this giant bino is a good alternative for telescopes which are tedious and tiring for long gazing, though, of course, no bino can replace a telescope fully for serious study of deep-sky objects.
__label__2 Nice product, but priced too high.: This is a nice product,but look around to save money. Right now a major department store (think red) is selling this for less than half of what they have it listed for here.
__label__1 Kindle version needs a better TOC!: I have the print version and use it as an exercise tool for creating poetic structures based on different sentence patterns. I decided it would be useful to have the Kindle version as a ready reference. Big mistake. The TOC does not list the patterns beyond number 3~navigation is such a headache. Also the graphics are pale gray and difficult to read. This is an example of a shoddy Kindle conversion.
__label__1 Not what you probably think: If you just want to know what some special forces units go through, then this book may be worth a look.Maybe I'm just dumb, but what I read in the description led me to expect a much different book. I am probably naive, but I would a book titles "The SAS Mental Endurance Handbook" to be written by someone with SAS experience and to be laid out as a ...handbook. This just is not.I am always fascinated to read how different groups approach the problems of mental endurance and performance under stress. I wish I could say this was a valuable addition to my library, but it's merely an OK read for people looking for general info and no actual training methods.
__label__2 A great story!: Down Memory Lane to Horse Creek is autobiographical account of the first fourteen years of Erma Hall Williams' life. It's a richly told story of pioneer life on the Great Plains. The characters are real people, family members and friends.This story is set on a farm three miles southeast of the Two Buttes, Colorado. The story touches every aspect of rural life, and is told in a way that appeals to young readers and readers interested in the details of farm living in 1913.Many of the descendents of people in the book still live in Baca County, Colorado. The landmarks and roads the author mentions are still there on the prairie. If your travels bring you to this dusty land, stop and visit with the people you meet. After you enjoy this wonderfully written story, you'd be surprised how many friends you'll make.
__label__1 Hard to follow - not enjoyable: This book was incredibly hard to follow and very difficult to read. I usually enjoy Booker prize winners but not this one! I do not recommend it to anyone.
__label__2 Neighbor friendly: We have a variety of wind chimes of different sizes and tones. Unlike those with the more "hearty" tones, these will not keep you awake at night during a storm yet are sturdy enough to withstand higher winds. They are also quiet enough to place in an area where you have neighbors that don't appreciate the soothing sounds that they make. We purchased two of them to place in an area that is frequented by deer and it seems to help in keeping them out! Keep in mind that they will weather with time eventually turning a beautiful bluish color.
__label__2 This is such a fun workout: I love this video workout. Its fun and a nice workout. Its short so u may want to consider doing this with another routine, but I Madonna breaks each step down and gradually builds up to the routine. Great addition to a daily dose of excercise!
__label__1 intro phil students: This is a very very very hard read compared to the Plato Republic, no doubt about it. A lot harder to follow and word meanings are slightly shifted from Plato's. I highly recommend sticking with the Plato one's if you can since those are easier reads.
__label__1 Beware of shrinkage: I'm wearing 34 inseam.3D coated 34 inseam shrink to 32 after a cold wash.Decided to get Silver Fox 36 inseam. Still at 36 after a warm wash and medium dry...Lottery...
__label__2 Very Good but Should Have Been Great: Nat deserved a serious look at his life and this book is a noble attempt. On the whole, it's a nice balance of his life and his art. But there are too many stupid little mistakes that I caught, it makes me wonder how much more I missed. I'd be happy to help fix future editions of this book! Examples: Elvis Presley never recorded for Capitol (he recorded for RCA) Oscar Moore went left the trio top play with his brother's band. Epstein makes this sound like a step down into obscurity. He doesn't even mention the while white-hot member, Charles Brown.
__label__1 Don't Bother to Buy: I ordered this bed and am returning it immediately. What the profile doesn't say about the bed is that you cannot keep the bed plugged in when not in use. Who has time to run around unplugging the thing as your cat hops in and out of it? I bought the K&H heated kitty bed three years ago and it just died, so was hoping for a longer operating bed. But I would rather have a bed that I can keep plugged in (and turns on only when she is in it) than one I have to keep an eye on.
__label__2 Joe Dropped a Dime!: I have become a big fan of Joe's.This brother is the Marvin Gaye of our time.A serious crooner with a magical feel for his lyrics and presentation.Keep on Keepin on Joe.....
__label__2 Car seat Peg Perego: Great Seat. Weight is not an issue for me. Very well made and I like the orange and brown. Fabric is easy to clean. The handle fits well and is a good balance point for carrying. Seat snaps into base easily. It seems a little large to me but I do not have much to compare it to. Price was good as it was on sale.
__label__2 From the review in Gramophone: Sir John's Fifth would seem to occupy a special place in everybody's affections. One must weigh a unity and strength of purpose, an entirely idiomatic response to instrumental colour and texture (the dark, craggy hues of the first two movements especially striking); and most important of all that very special, very characteristically Barbirollian radiance, humanity--call it what you will. One point of interest for those of us updating our LPs (and EMI have made a splendid job of the digital remastering): among minor orchestral mishaps in the Scherzo, were four bars of missing horn obbligato (at nine bars before fig 20). Not any more! The original solo horn player, Nicholas Busch, has returned to the scene of this momentary aberration (Watford Town Hall), and the absent bars have been ingeniously (you would never know) reinstated. There's even a timely grunt from Sir John, as if in approval. Something of a classic, then.
__label__1 Not a good wheel: I tried this wheel with a Ford racing game. It has an excessive center dead spot. I tried to adjust it for finer control and it could not. It just does not respond until the wheel has been turned a significant distance to either side, which causes one to end up overcompensating and then losing control. Not at all realistic. Not fun.Might be better with another game? I am not willing to try it by buying another game.
__label__1 Great DNA read, highly recommended but not in kindle format: This read is a fun, light hearted poke at some serious questions. Enjoyed the ride immensely. However, the kindle version of this book is poorly converted, there are grammatical errors (inconsistent with the original) and the great idea of having material to view at the end is largely ruined for iPhone app users due to lack of a zoom function, rendering the material impossible to read and fairly useless. Get your act together amazon! You're ruining a great product.
__label__1 not satisfite-: the first part of the cd is o.k. -but the second part is a lot of scrambles -and like it's stuck on one place.
__label__2 An informed and informative descriptive analysis of Chinese capitalism as practiced today: In China And Socialism: Market Reforms And Class Struggle, co-authors Martin Hart-Landsberg (Professor of Economics, Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon) and Paul Burkett (Professor of Economics, Indiana State University) provide the non-specialist general reader with an informed and informative descriptive analysis of Chinese capitalism as practiced today. Chapters cover China's economic transformation, as well as contradictions both domestic and international to this transformation. Tables, figures, and a wealth of research back the history, theories, and projects with solid data. A "must-read" especially for political scientists, economists, and businessmen seeking to better understand the changes that continue revolutionize China's economic model to this day.
__label__2 Quality matierial, good price: I bought this collar as an alternative to a slide collar, works well, good materials, quality construction, and a nice, rich red color.
__label__1 Very Disappointed: I am very disappointed to find out that this book has only one page talking about JDBC and database related issue. Java has been used mostly in commerce applications whose performance is greatly depending on database design, JDBC, stored procedures, etc...
__label__1 Funny at times: A few humorous moments, but a pretty lame movie concept overall. Would not rent again or recommend to anyone I know.
__label__2 Must Buy for Hendrix Fans!: This is the best guitar techniques book I've ever bought. The instructional cd enclosed is the best Hendrix instruction tool to date. This book is a must buy for any guitarist.
__label__2 Great faucet: We bought ours over two years ago. After a couple of months the turn mechanism became very difficult to turn. We called the 800 number and Price Pfister sent us a replacement spout and a new filter for our trouble. It was the easiest correction under a warranty ever! The replacement spout has been fine since. The water tastes good and the filters are easy to find. The only criticisms I have is that the manual mechanism may be difficult for elderly folks or people with weakened hand strength to operate. (If purchasing a faucet filter for them, I'd recommend something like the Moen products). The second criticism is that the spout's dimensions make the end of the unit a bit top heavy. I wonder if the faucet would hold up to the "kid test" if wacked.
__label__2 Empowering the Imagination!: Like many parents, I've dabbled just enough in children's literature to know how hard it is to write a successful kid's book. Writing Children's Books for Dummies is an invaluable resource for would-be authors, that helps bridge the gap between the spark of inspiration and the finished product -- books that bring joy to children and find success in the marketplace. This is absolutely not a formulaic approach to meeting the challenges of writing for kids -- its intuitive, insightful, and filled with must-read practical advice.
__label__2 So Adorable!: I purchased this as a birthday present for my 1 year-old daughter, and she LOVES it. We love it too! The scale of the piano and bench fit her perfectly (and will continue to for the next few years, I'm sure), and she looks absolutely adorable sitting there pounding away at the keys. This is my favorite toy of all the toys we've bought for her so far.
__label__1 pen and pencil is great, however: i ordered this product a few months ago, and the pen and pencil are great, however the eraser refills are hard to find in stores (in fact im still looking), when i was looking for the erasers at office depot i noticed what appears to be the same pen pencil set for 20 dollars cheaper.
__label__2 Gorgeous Concept: I read the short story beginning of this book (I think it was the first chapter intact, actually) awhile ago in The New Yorker and have been waiting for the novel ever since. Brockmeier's city of the dead is a fascinating place, and the possibilies he touches on are, without exception, compelling and even plausible. Readers who are hoping for a fast-paced genre novel will likely be disappointed here. It dwells not on the futuristic elements of the story, nor on the apocalyptic ones (thoough both of these things are interesting elements) but on the nature of endurance, love, and why we want to stay alive - even if we're dead already. This book is more in line with a work like Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, or with some of the poems of W.S. Merwin, rather than with anything Asimov. The writing is gorgeous, and Brockmeier's meditation on death, and ultimately on the meaning of life and of the number of lives that we touch (even inadvertently) is moving.
__label__1 Owls In The Family: Owls In The Family was okay; I would recommend it to a younger age group like 3rd or 4th grade. It gave me a lot of owl info - but I wouldn't read it again!
__label__2 Good English translation, but Arabic typeface is too ornate for novice readers: Yusuf Ali's English translation is positioned as the column to the left of the column of the Arabic text. The Arabic text, however, is somewhat difficult to read because the ornate typeface employed is too distracting. I preferThe Meaning of the Holy Qur'anby Amana Publications of Beltsville MD, which uses a much plainer and easy to read Arabic typeface that is similar to that used in beginning Arabic language textbooks. The Amana Koran is more suitable for novices such as myself. The Amana Koran employs the same English translation by Yusuf Ali as this book published by Muhammad Ashraf.
__label__1 This is NOT Paderewski edition: Don't waste money thinking this is Paderewski edition.If this can be any edition, can be a good deal, but if you need Paderewski edition, this is not. I am not sure amazon understand the difference.
__label__1 lasted half an hour: This was a gift to my 11 year old from his grandparents. He picked it out, was very excited when it arrived, assembled himself. I didnt supervise as he's quite handy. He played with it in our large pool for awhile then couldn't get it going again. Its sitting taken apart in the back yard as he's discouraged. Maybe its fragile or needs adult supervision but not a good toy for an 11 yr old.
__label__2 Not as good as a professional cleaning, but good enough!: I just got my Bissell today. It took less than two minutes to screw in the three screws to assemble it. All you'll need is a Phillips-head screwdriver. As others have said, just put two capfulls of the cleaner (a sample bottle is included) into the tank & then add hot tap water up to the line. The machine is not heavy, isn't as loud as my Hoover vaccum cleaner, and does a decent job. My finacee moved into our apartment four months before I did, and the cream-colored carpet was clean then. Between him dropping food and drink onto the floor constantly, and his cat leaving hairballs all over, the carpet was badly stained by the time I moved in. While the Bissell didn't completely remove all of the old stains, the dirty water showed that the cleaner had done a decent job. I am pleased with the results for the price.
__label__2 One of the best cartoons in 10 years.: First let me say that Adventure Time centers around a young human boy and a shape shifting dog in the magical land of Ooo. When I heard about this show from a couple of friends I though this show would suck, but after a couple of episodes I was hooked.I got this DVD for a christmas present today, and I really like the episodes along with the cover art and the art on the dvds. When you take Finn's hat off it shows his blond hair, and the dvds show his skull and brain, a really unique design, along with the episode guide being his skin.The DVDS contain all 26 episodes from season 1 with all the hilarity along with it. If you are an Adventure Time fan like me, you should really get it.
__label__1 There's much better available: I was very disappointed in this book -- it's one of the few I've bought from Amazon based on reviews alone. Compared to herbal/nutrition books like The Green Pharmacy, Scientific Validation of Medicinal Herbs, and energy work/body work books like Touch for Health, I found this a mish-mash of information.I did not like the way in which the references (where there were any) to research were handled, the indexing is poor and information is hard to find, and the illustrations are extraordinarily ugly and amateurish.I'm very interested in muscle testing, so I'll look further.
__label__1 All talk, no action.: Maybe I missed the point, but all the story consisted of was two strangers meet on a train, get off the train and spend time together and talk, talk, talk; agree to meet in the same city at a future date, get back on separate trains and go their separate ways. Not much of a story here.
__label__1 More Hype than Substance: I got this to learn some hip-hop moves to incorporate into my dance routine. While it is fun to watch, it is definitely not made to be an instructional piece. I agree w/everyone's gripe about the orientation and mirroring aspect. The "slow" part of showing the steps were laughable.Look to it for ideas and inspiration. Don't count on learning moves clearly and step-by-step w/this.There are good dancers and/or good dance instructors. It is not common to see both in one person. Darrin is an awesome dancer, but a visibly unseasoned instructor as demonstrated by this sad example.
__label__1 A disappointing performance by an amazing singer: I am a huge Josh Groban Fan and personally, have been moved by his music. I feel so guilty as this is the first time that I am publicly writing anything about Josh and am going to criticize an amazing artist. Plan and simple, I honestly believe that Josh's voice was strained in this concert and unfortunately PBS chose the wrong time to make a recording. In songs like Alejate, he sounded like a billy-goat when he was singing the refrain. If you listen to Josh Groban in Concert and compare it to this DVD concert, you will definitely hear the difference and understand where I am coming from. However, I hope people don't judge his vocal ability by this one concert as I have heard him perform live many times and can honestly say that he has one of the best voices that I have ever heard, period.
__label__1 Wrong item but no info in the description.: This is a good item, just too bad they did NOT give the proper years for the product in the description. It said for Dodge Ram 2500/3500 and that is exactly what I needed. Got the order in and opened the box.... doesn't fit. On the box it says 03 - 12 but we have a 2000 model Dodge. NOT COOL people. I checked to see if it fit with Amazon's "does this fit your vehicle" drop downs and it said it did!So, be careful when ordering if they don't give a year model.I could only give the seller a 1 star for NOT giving proper information on year coverage.
__label__1 too old: Okay let me just tell you one thing this book has only the oldest transformers comics in it. It barely has any action at all in it. It has the original 1-6 transformers comics. It doesn`t have better artwork or a better story line. But if you want some old transformers comics I say go for these.
__label__1 Too...Hard...too...Follow: In this book of vignettes, Sandra Cisneros takes you through the poverty and troubles of growing up in a Hispanic-American section of Chicago. She will introduce you to the life of Esperanza. You will venture from her childhood and up until she becomes an adult.In The House on Mango Street, you will be confused throughout a lot of the book. You will have to reread parts of the book to understand what point Cisneros may be trying to get across. If you get this book, you might have to read the book two to three times to fully understand it.An example of a part you might get confused at is when Esperanza compares herself to a red balloon tied down. Another example is when Esperanza compares her family to four skinny trees. Where she is tied down by her roots.All in all, this book isn't for the simple minded. The main reason being is it will make you think! It would have been a more enjoyable book if it was not so hard to understand.
__label__1 Did anyone understand any of it?: Sure it was visually stunning and more movies should be made like this, but the story went pretty much nowhere. I am not a fan of the FF franchise, but one of my best friends is and loved FF7 the game, and even he agrees that this movie made absolutely no F'ing sense.
__label__1 Did not work: I tried in vain to get these emitters to work. See my review for the main unit. Also, they don't stay on for long, fell off after only a few days.
__label__1 Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships.: Great title, useless material. I purchase a lot of audio programs and I threw this one out before I finished it
__label__2 funny, compassionate, and real: Blair Clemmens, a single mother dying of cancer, is so spunky and wonderfully flawed you could follow her anywhere. Her sixteen-year-old daughter, Amanda, is beautifully rendered. Throw in a romantic interest in the form of Luke Bellingham--opposites attract--and you have a story that is funny, compassionate, and real. Wonderful!
__label__1 Broken dish after being in the freezer: After I had frozen a mixture in a gratin dish , I placed the dish on a cloth covered wooden table. When I went to serve the contents I noticed a complete split down the middle of the dish. The instructions did say that the dish can be placed in the freezer. Have written to the company so we shall see what happens.
__label__1 You get what you pay for......: This software is terrible. I've only turned a few PDF files into Word files but they are not even close to the original. Total waste of money for me.
__label__1 Try toothpaste & hairspray instead - it's cheaper and quicker.: I was psyched to fix the disks that made my stereo want to cry as they played one note over and over like a song at a bad rave.You have to spend too much time on each disk if you want to fix your whole collection, or even part of it in one sitting. I made it through 10 disks before giving up (and my hands getting sore) the first night.The product essentially works like this: it comes with a tiny spray bottle, and you crank the handle as the disc turns VERY SLOWLY, and the wheel inside that is lined with a cloth smoothes the spray into the scratches.Effectiveness: It didn't fix my most-played discs, the ones with deeper scratches, but it did HELP with the rest (not good-as-new quality). I have had just as much luck with toothpaste and hairspray. Seriously.Overall I would say it isn't worth the money, time or effort, and it made my hands too sore too quickly.
__label__2 Very educational!: This book teaches many new words and phrases that are very useful to the Latin beginner
__label__2 Boy at war: Adam was just so interesting, it was also funny because he went racists for a quick minute .It was cool how he grabbed Davi and threw him to the boat.
__label__1 It's all downhill on these tracks: This album contains none of the intimate and enchanting tunes that gave Josh Ritter a devoted following, tunes like "Me and Jiggs" and "Harrisburg" in Golden Age of Radio. All of the songs I heard are completely unmemorable and the best ones remind me of the worst of Gilbert O'Sullivan. To make things still worse, the recording quality of this CD is simply terrible, it is so highly compressed. I can only guess that poor Josh must be going through some creative crisis and this was his record company's doing to capitalize on his past and well deserved success. I hope this album is just an aberration and that Josh gets back to his former self soon.

__label__2 Let it Be: The Beatles: The Beatles Let it Be album was one of the last albums in the Beatles rock and roll history. I feel that this album was really meaningfull to a lot of people. I feel it was originally writin to inform people that "Hey, leave it alone! It's okay the way it is."
__label__1 sophmoric: this is comic book Nietzsche. If you like this, do yourself a favor and read the source of this tributary. That it is writ by an ex-patriot Russian she male should give pause to her(?) politics, and such an hyperbolic ad hominem attack is justified due to the juvenal nature of her corpus.That this is still read should make any thinker pray for death or roused to kill. Gods! Stifle the bile climbing my throat!
__label__1 Nothing new here: Like so much pop-psychology today, what this book teaches is a small portion of Biblical Chrisianity...but without the Bible and without Christ.The book could also be titled The Golden Rule. It teaches, basically, "do (treat) unto others as you would have them do (treat) you." In the business world, this philosophy has been a formal rule for how to do business since 1902 when J. C. Penney opened his first store, named the Golden Rule Store, which he developed into the JC Penney chain of today. As a moral philosophy, the ideas of this book have been around since Christ taught them 2000 years ago. This philosophy in an awesome one to live your life and business by. However, unlike what the authors seem to suggest, it is not the key.Why settle for a portion of Biblical Christianity when you can have it all, free of charge.
__label__1 Straps will not stay tight: I purchased these Optima snoeshoes about three years ago to use where limited floatation is needed. Despite all efforts the heel straps keep loosening up after only a few minutes and the shoe comes off making them worthless. These were inexpensive snowshoes and if the straps were not an issue I would have given them a 5 star rating.
__label__1 remarkably bad movie: so sad what they did to this series. should have just left well enough alone. they fight in a bathroom and hit each other over the head with urinals for crying out loud. where the first two ended with a sense of hope, this ends with the end of the world, making everything before a giganto waste of time. yea, arnold looks amazing here, but thats just not enough! WHY!!!
__label__2 FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3: FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 was the first film in the whole series where Jason Vorhees picked up the hockey mask that he would wear for the rest of the series (that is of course, after he kills the guy who was wearing it). This installment has a group of teenagers who go to a farmhouse in the country to party for the weekend, and the farmhouse just happens to be located down the road from Camp Crystal Lake, which means that the teenagers will eventually meet there death at the hands of our mutant maniac Jason. A welcome sense of humor helps this third entry in the series.
__label__2 The absolute most scarriest movie you will ever see!: Definately the perfect movie see on your first date. Or your last...
__label__2 Don't wait for Hollywood Version! No way to improve this movie!: There is no freakin' way a Hollywood version of this movie will be more awesome or intense than this movie. Lisbeth and Kalli are perfect! GREAT GREAT GREAT movie. Seriously; BUY IT NOW and WATCH IT!
__label__2 I adored this book as a child: This book is absolutely magical. If you get a chance, pick it up for your child.
__label__1 Disappointed: That other guy was right about one thing. This CD only contains 7 out of 18 of the tracks listed! It excludes the main songs I bought it for like: Cats don't know, Bling bling, Back that azz up, Wanna be a baller, Da goodness, and Vivrant thing. I gave it two stars because it does still have some ok songs on it, but check out the REAL tracks before you buy.
__label__1 beware same book different name: The author wrote another book titled The Midwife that is the EXACT same book as this one. When I saw this book I thought great another book written by a great author. I was SHOCKED when I received it and looked at the chapters and the titles were the SAME. Very disappointing and misleading. Choose one or the other but dont buy both!
__label__1 Funny predictible uber-horror: When I rented this film I really didn't expect much out of it, but surprise surprise, it didn't suck as much as I thought it would. Now I'm as big a fan of Pat Morita as the next guy, but his preformance as the only "big name" talent is really disapointing. He has a showdown with the snake. A THIRTY FOOT SNAKE!! vs. PAT MORITA. DOES THAT SEEM TO MAKE SENSE!!!?? But hey what do you expect. The film's acting was tolerable, some of the effects were ok, but for the most part a big rubbery looking snake with an awckwardly positioned neck, and the token *SHOCK* shots used to make the film "scarrier" make you jump a bit, but oly in releif that you don't have to b on the lookout. The ending was also a huge dissapointment. You never find ut what happens to some of the characters and it practicaly screams at you, "LOOK OUT FOR KING COBRA 2" ut what do you expect from straight to video horror. ^.^
__label__1 ...: I found the claims of the authors odd. It is simply not true that this is "the first and only full-color book on the subject of "warm," or kiln-fired, glass in print". There are several. The one considered the "standard" by most kiln-formers is the book by Brad Walker by the same title. Walker's book is both comprehensive, and lavishly and clearly illustrated. [...]I hope folks who are seriously interested in learning about kiln-working glass will take a look at Brad Walker's book. It is more expensive than this [one], but worth every cent. It is the best resource I have seen on the craft and art of kiln-working glass.
__label__2 the zelda of zelda for the N64: the zelda of zelda ocarina of time is one of the best games on the N64. It may be an old game but I still play it when not game cube. Nintendo is coming out with it on GC. This is a very good game for the Nintendo 64.
__label__2 A LIFE CHANGER AND A MUST HAVE!!!: DIVINE REVELATION OF HEAVEN was my favorite!!!Because it is all about happiness and perfection and the glories of Heaven of course!!!I read this knowing it wasn't going to be exiting and full happiness, but it warns you and makes you think about what your life style is like and what you need to correct!!!I also happen to live in Canton ,Michigan not that far from where this took place!!!
__label__2 Delightful!: I want to be Phryne when I grow up. She's smart, resourceful, talented and independent. She is wealthy, but remembers what it was like to be poor. She cares about people and can distinguish between the criminal and the misguided. This is a quick short, quick read that is well plotted, has wonderful supporting characters that kept me involved from the first page. Although this entry isn't quite as strong as others in the series, it is still a delight to read. I'm delighted Poisoned Pen Press is publishing this series for the U.S. audience.
__label__2 For the chocolate lover...sized well: These are good tasting cookies if you enjoy chocolate. Have a nice gooey chocolate center. They also have nice texture. I ususally enjoy best chewie chocolate chip type cookies, these are harder but not too hard.But that also does lead to their one drawback, they do tend to crumble and with the chocolate in the middle that can get a bit messy. One last positive point though. At least for the 2-count pack of 50, 2 is a great snack size. Enough to feel full but not too much. Recommended.
__label__1 Maybe the flavored ones are better?: I purchased a case of Vita Coco at my local Costco thinking it would be a nice way to rehydrate after working out. The flavored ones might be better, but to me the plain tastes like vomit. This is not an example of hyperbole. It literally tastes like vomit. Unlike a previous reviewer I think it's better room temperature than it is chilled, but I will not be purchasing this variety again. I'd be willing to try one of the flavored varieties, because maybe that masks the nasty.
__label__2 Excellent Cover: Put the cover on a few days ago and it's outstanding. It took about 30 minutes to install. I highly recommend watching the video, then follow the enclosed instructions. The installation went much smoother after watching someone else install the cover first. The cover is made of very sturdy material. I didn't have to adjust the tension when i put the cover on and it was tight enough to bounce a quarter off of it. It snaps closed very securely and easy to open with the Dual Latching System. I would recommend this top to anyone looking for a quality soft cover at a reasonable price.
__label__2 Conan told me to buy it.: Just as the FedEx Pope is an amazing character, Seagal is an excellent composer. I could listen to this CD all year long while I watch the months pass by on my Extraordinary Chickens wall calendar.
__label__1 Don't buy this printer server: This print server is junk. It doesn't support multifunction printers, the on-line help is non-existent, the manual is useless, the options aren't adequate on the admin interface. Basically it doesn't work. Support said there's no option to make it work. And they don't have a replacement model that will.
__label__1 VerySlow: If you are not in a hurry or cutting a lot then this might work for you. The blade (wire) does not get hot enough at all. I am using it to cut packing foam and it won't even cut that.
__label__2 This recording is OK: This recording is OK, But does anyone Know how to get a copy of Putting It Straight? I have a worn out copy of that recording and have been trying to replace it for a long time. It has the same cover as this "Best Of..." And is my personal favorite. Michael
__label__1 Simplistic: I bought this book because a talk radio show host said they were awesome and he had the author on his show. I read the reviews and everyone had high marks but I thought the book was a little dimensionally limited in that the story was very simple with no twists and the back stories which were part of the characterizations were somewhat shallow. The book is filled with action and if you like that stuff, this is a good read. I think I am more inclined towards long adventure or historical novels so I may not be the best reviewer of this type of book. Overall, it was ok but I will not get another of these.
__label__2 RAD bike hoist: I mounted these on a rail which made my installation simple. One unit did have a frayed rope but otherwise they worked great.
__label__2 If this isn't their best, I'd love to hear more: I haven't heard enough of Toad's previous works to know how Coil compares to earlier disks, but I've heard that this isn't their best. If that's true, I really need to hear their other ones because I think Coil is fabulous. It has meaningful lyrics and outstanding vocals. The music isn't so loud that it drowns out the words and its more than just a bunch of guitar riffs thrown into a sequence. That's not to say that the guitar is bad, because its very good and compliments the vocals well. The whole disk is excellent but the songs that particularly stand out to me are "Whatever I Fear," "Come Down," "All Things in Time," "Throw it all Away," and my new favorite song "Little Man Big Man." Toad knows how to write a song that means something. There's none of the sex, drugs, and offensive language that dominate rock music today. I can't wait to hear some of Toad's earlier albums and it's a shame they broke up.
__label__1 Disappointed: I bought this collar for my Lab/Rot mix. I was slightly disappointed at the amount of time the setup took. What was worse though was the length of time it took for the remote to actually activate the collar. Walking my dog on a 6 ft leash made the collar nearly unusable. The corrections were not instant as needed for proper training, they took too long to be given and at that point there is no connection between the shock and the behavior. For the price I expected a much higher quality collar.
__label__1 discouraging price for wonderful material: How disappointing that this is priced so far out of the reach of more than 99% of potential customers. I implore the creator of this CD to drop the price to perhaps a 30th of the current insane price. You would likely boost sales by hundreds of thousands (certainly, far more than 30 times as many sales) and thereby reap vastly more profit while doing a great favor for science, society, education, and future generations. At the unrealistically high $700 price tag I expect that even large libraries would balk at buying it.For years I looked forward to reading (and re-reading) the Amateur Scientist column in each month of Scientific American.The awful waste of restricting this to only a small number of very privileged people makes me weep.
__label__1 Disappointing: The novel starts well enough, but then it meanders for about a hundred pages. Again and again the writer mulls over the suspects without coming to any conclusion. One almost senses that space is being filled for the publisher, without the plot moving forward a single inch.But that is tolerable, perhaps. What is not tolerable is the murderer confessing in detail (while a tape recorder is running) and explaining just how the killing took place and why the crime was necessary--and then committing suicide. Baloney! It has been done far too many times. Surely readers are sick of this by now. The evidence here against the killer is flimsy at best, certainly not strong enough to stand up in court if the accused has a decent lawyer. All the murderer has to do is deny, deny, deny. The easy way out of this for the writer? Those old stand-bys, confession and suicide. Surely there has to be some alternative to this facile denouement.
__label__1 Slower than molasses--until I formatted it.: NOTE TO EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS CARD--I reformatted it in my camera and it works fine now!!Initially I wrote:I was very disappointed in the shot-to-shot speed with this card (using a Minolta Xg). The Panasonic card that came with the camera, which I thought would be cheap, is THREE TIMES FASTER than this "upgrade". This card is useless to me as it cripples the camera I bought it to work in. It takes FOURTEEN SECONDS from one shot to the next with this card. With the original card, it's less than four seconds. The claim that this is a "high speed" card is dishonest. This is the slowest card I've ever used. I will throw this card away rather than curse someone else with it.
__label__1 You'll need 2 of all weights: Nice to know before picking up the video. Will need to go buy another set of bells before I can get started. That, or get a different video I guess.
__label__2 Grey's Season 4: This is by far the best show on TV! If you want funny, dramatic and tear-jerking...this has them all. With characters you can sink your teeth into and love to hate (or love to love), how could you not watch?
__label__2 Fourth film of the series. It's ok, but lacking the Dirty Harry style: Sudden Impact was released in 1983 and Clint Eastwood is a little grayer and slower in this film. Still has the Dirty Harry charm but it's the 80s and doesn't have that 70s touch like Magnum Fore, Enforcer, and Dirty Harry. Sondra Locke co-stars with him in this one and her characater is lacking and scary? Dirty Harry is tracking down some killers who raped her sister years ago. Very boring plot. I gave it four starts because I like Eastwood.
__label__1 Defective auto shut off: I've owned several of these. I'm throwing my current one away and ordering another. My current one heats the water to boiling and then continues to heat for 10-15 seconds after that while my water boils away as steam. My other ones shut off as soon as the water reached boiling.
__label__2 very interesting great photography: Condor footage and knowledge was great. Exceptional scenes and interesting facts. Traveling to Big Sur this summer with the family and this was a good pre-cursor.
__label__1 unimpressive translation of one of the greatest novels ever: I taught this novel in my French Lit class this week. I was terribly disappointed by this translation, which is British, and very old. My students, for the most part well-read graduate students, didn't get the novel at all. This shoddy and dated translation does not grasp the lyricism, the poetry, the imagination and the easy flow of Alain-Fournier's prose. There are many better translations. I fear this one was chosen because it was easiest to get a hold of, probably because the publishers didn't have to pay a fee. I find this to be a shameful sign of the direction publishing is taking these days. LE GRAND MEAULNES is truly one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century.
__label__1 Poor quality transfer: I received a copy of this videotape as a gift last Christmas and found it to be of such poor quality as to be unwatchable. A few years ago the A&E network aired the film, and it was definitely shot in color - NOT colorized later on, as the tape manufacturer claims. See the info on imdb.com (under the listing "Trilogy") for confirmation of this. The video is a shoddy product that shouldn't be on the market. Let the buyer beware.
__label__2 Sasha Is Awesome!: I love Style It! Sasha! This is the first Bratz doll with curly hair and I love it! Her clothes are really cool especially her shirts! The jeans are cool, and so are Sasha's boots. I dont know what it is about her skin tone, but it looks like than the other Sasha's, but I personally think it looks better. As for her hair, I would advise combing it as little as possible. I haven't had any trouble with it, but I dont want to damage the curls, so I try to keep away from the hair (which is hard for me because I love doing Bratz hair)
__label__1 funny but useless: This "Bad Girl's Guide" book was just less than slightly entertaining - The title implies the book might be a helpful "guide", when in fact it is simply full of ridiculous lists. Some parts of the book were actually quite humorous, while the content was lacking - Just don't expect to get anything out of it except a couple of laughs.
__label__1 Who is Micah?: I ask the question, Who is Micah, because after reading this very short novel I still do not know Micah's character. Anita is so nasty that it is very hard to become interested in the story. She is the narrator which is even worse. Micah should have been the one to tell his story, if indeed Hamilton actually intended to write about Micah - which she obviously did not. Anita Blake was my first foray into romance/paranormal/science fiction, and I loved the series until the last few books. Now that I have become an avid reader of all types of romance novels, I don't think Hamilton's way of telling a story is that great. She bores me by repeating her tired scenerios of sex and angst. What happened to adventure and excitement? Get Anita back on track or do her and readers a favor and kill her and the series off.
__label__1 Terrible: This book is nothing but hard core porn. I didn't even finish it, it had so much in it that made me sick! I sent it back and felt it was a terrible book.
__label__2 exactly what I needed: Because this range bag is moderately priced I had concerns. I should not have worried as it is exactly what I wanted.It has plenty of room, sturdy and well made, comes with a shoulder strap as well as the hand straps which is great when one has other things to carry along with the bag.The photo was not clear as to whether the rivets holding the handles on had stitching also, it does so no worry about popping a rivet and the handle tearing away. For the money and in this size you can't go wrong. I have already suggested this range bag to friends.
__label__1 Not Funny at All and I'm a Fan: Seriously disappointed. I think I "chuckled twice"...if that! Harvey falls into that trap many comedians often do...use cussing and vulgarity to mask unoriginal content. He sounded more like DL Hughley than Steve Harvey! So if you like the DL brand of comedy..have at it. Nothing clever or original in his material.
__label__2 Great watch: I've been wearing this watch for a few months and it's become my favorite. Comfortable, easy to see, elegant, easy to clean.
__label__2 Perfect: I purchased these as a refill for the small containers that came with my stovetop smoker. I use my smoker several times a week and these are just perfect. I am now searching for other types of wood to extend my repertoire. I just love this technique for preparing the most delectably moist meat and seafood ever.
__label__2 Looking for the perfect "battle bots" game? Look no further!: I had the original Robot Arena, it was an OK game but was easily mastered. This, Robot Arena 2, is the perfect game for anyone who wants to build a custom robot to fight against others. The physics are realistic(until a glitch happens...and they DO happen) and the only reason I took one star away is that you are limited by weight...so your "dream bot" may not actually be realized due to this restriction...a few of my ideas were.WARNING: Newer NVIDIA based graphics cards will need to install a patch BEFORE this game will be playable.
__label__1 A waste of money: Not only is it a waste of money, it was a waste of my 3 year old's time, her 8 and 11 year old brother's time and my time! We finally threw it in the trash because we were all so frustrated with it. It never registered the choice you touched, it wouldn't even give you the screen that matched the card you put in. We all tried several times and her brothers are video game wizzes and even they couldn't get it to work. Don't waste your money, time and energy on this piece of junk. GRRRRRRR
__label__2 A rich adventure for youth: This is an intelligent, exciting, message-full adventure in the style of the Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time etc. and the like. The lessons are a bit heavily stated, from an adult perspective, but not syrupy. I got this book because I'm a great fan of Gillman's Tightrope Walker (in which this book is mentioned), Incident at Badamya, and Caravan--great adult thought-provokers.
__label__1 Give this a miss: Alan Simpson's book is probably the worst piece of trash I've seen. He's a complete hack whose only distinguishing quality is that he was one of the first computer writers out there. Do yourself a favor and pass this one by.
__label__2 A great read for anyone!: Some say that this book is hard to read because of the different characters telling the story, however, there are only four narrators telling the story which I thought made the book more interesting to read.The Annunciation of Francescia Dunn tells the story of a 14 yr old who suddenly finds people are worshiping her. Throughout the book you feel for her, and you feel for her mother and the people around her. The book keeps you hoping that she really is the virgin mother, with each chapter you wait to see what new developments take place. Not until the very last chapter does the full picture come together.
__label__1 Immature: A Crack Up at the Race Riots is the work of an immaturewriter. I am a big fan of Korine's film work but he fails to succeedin effectively recreating his film style on paper. The book is uninteresting because it aims to upset the reader but is neither original or intelligent enough to do so. It is scatological in a very uninteresting and highschool manner ... The non-linear framework is not innovative as he didn't create the concept and definitely not effective as there is no focus whatsoever, just immature scriblings that any malcontent 16 year old could create. A disappointment from a very talented film maker.
__label__2 Sweetback: I love this album from beginning to end. I remember seeing the video to "you will rise" on BET Video Soul in 1995 or 1996 and I was just attracted to the song. I love Sade the band as a whole and Sweetback just came with it on this album. My favorite songs are "gaze", "softly, softly", "hope she'll be happier", "you will rise", and "sensations".
__label__1 Nino docking station issues: I wanted to buy an additional docking station for my work pc in addition to my laptop. I've order and returned two docking stations and neither of them work. Also be aware that the $39.98 price does NOT include the adaptor!
__label__1 Useless piece of plastic: This case looks just like the hard plastic case a colleague bought, the one that clips to your belt, locks the phone in tight, and protects it from a fall, and I thought I was getting a great price on-line. Couldn't have been farther from the truth. The case does not actually close, and would break in an instant if dropped from higher than 6 inches. Totally useless piece of junk.
__label__1 "Dan is Real Cliche...": I have enjoyed Steve Carell in prior roles...but not here. The film is woefully miscast in its lead characters with Juliette Binoche looking and acting a full 20 years older than her supposed initial love interest, Dane Cook. The plot is so formulaeic that you know exactly what will happen and who will end up with who in the first 5 minutes and nothing that happens along the way comes as a surprise. The film works on almost no levels and is completely pedestrian in every way. Everything here has been done numerous times before and in better, funnier ways...don't rent, don't buy...move on and look for something else..
__label__1 I love the Elemental Heroes!: Without the Elemental Heroes, this is not fun. but it completes my yugioh collection.
__label__2 NUTS the Squirrel: This Beanie Baby has been discontinued so I was very happy to find it. Each year I order the colored cones for my fireplace from Plow & Hearth. A few years ago, I discovered how charming the little squirrel looks perched on top of the basket of cones. I ordered this one to send as a gift to a relative I send the colored cones to each year so he can put this little fellow on top of his basket of cones ... ADORABLE!
__label__1 not interesting: We have read many books for our 1.5 year old. This one is probably the least entertaining and only mildly educational. Miss Spider's ABC's, Sandra Boynton books, lemons are not red, don't let pidgeon drive the bus are much better.
__label__1 not as advertised; not compatible with all Bluetooth phones.: I sent an email to Amazon because I was told by a Verizon servic rep that the Minikit was not compatible with my Bluetooth phone. I have returned it, as per Amazon's instruction and I am awaiting a refund.
__label__2 Works for me: I have been using the ultra keyboard and mouse for quite awhile. I gave one as a gift to a friend as well. Both of us really enjoy the function of the keyboard, mouse and the base. I use the "in the air" mouse when I am kicked back, otherwise I find it to be optically responsive. I can move the keyboard to the side for occaisional key strokes as I study in the center of the desk. My friend uses the set in a similar manner. No problems with ours to date.
__label__2 Photoshop 5.0 by Ben Willmore is a must read book.: After much debate at a local bookstore I finally desided to buy this book, based largely on the chapter dealing with text effects. Soon after reading it while in Photoshop I soon discovered that I was reading a fantastic book. Very presice in its explanations and very to the point without what Ben calls "Techno Mumbo Jumbo". While reading any book I often "tab" important pages, I had to stop doing that with this book, I found myself tabing every page!!!. If you are a novice at Photoshop like I was, buy this book it is worth its weight in GOLD. I just wish Ben would now do a book on version 5.5.Scott R. Hirschman
__label__1 I don't think they are bad musicians... they are bad people.: I don't think Cannibal Corpse are bad musicians. Enjoying death metal or not is a question of musical taste, every person has its own. And, inside a genre, of course there are good and bad musicians.I'm not discussing the quality of CAnnibal Corpse's musicians. I'm discussing their character, their personality. What kind of person would, given the opportunity to make a record deal to record aggressive and no commercial music, use this opportunity to write such disgusting, bad, mean, obnoxious, insane, malevolent and utter evil lyrics? Why would a musician in his right frame of mind do it?!! WHy would them hire artists to draw such evil cover arts? I'm not saying "evil" in the religious sense, I mean evil in ideas, in character.I hate this band with all my heart (and this an evil feeling, I know!)and I hope they dissapear forever.
__label__2 Holiday Spirit: I would like to know when Touched by an Angel is being released on DVD, and coming to Australia?Erna Hudson
__label__1 Not consistent: We have two of these in a corporate network environment. Neither of them is reliable about detection - I don't know if it's cable length or what. But devices (computers, laptop, etc.) are using the network fine, but these checkers most often report no connection even when there is one.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: After about 20 uses the PLASTIC gears have stripped. This may be resolved by keeping hose length to a maximum of 50 feet so the machine doesnt have too much weight to pull around. What good is 50 foot though??? My recomendation is find a model with all metal gears.
__label__2 Could skip the middle 2/5 of the book: After the set-up in the intitial chapters, there isn't much development. You could skip ahead to the last two fifths and not miss much. As one other reviewer said, you can read this in an afternoon, but it is a worthwhile addition to a science fiction collection.
__label__2 a nice workout: This is the workout you need for those days when you want to exercise, but you don't want to feel like you've been hit by a bus afterwards. Know what I mean? :-) It's "nice," to put it plain and simple. It feels really good and is just challenging enough. If you do it giving your best effort, you will feel worked from head to toe. Do focus on the advice Kathy Smith gives about your form because that really adds to the results. When I come to the upper body section, I use 3 lb. weights, whereas in other workouts, I can do 5lbs. at least. This workout targets the muscles you are trying to get at, so you have to go a little lighter! But when it's over, you'll feel great!
__label__2 Never go wrong with Pokemon: Entertaining for hours. Requires you pay attention and develop strategies to move to the next level. High cool factor
__label__2 BenQ MP610: With it's 2000 lumens and sleek black casing this projector ROCKS! The color saturation is one of the best that I have seen in it's price range. It also has a 4000 hour lamp (in eco mode) and is very quiet. The only disappointment is when you play XBOX360 in HD 1080i resolution the image does not fill the whole screen, (it's like watching a wide screen dvd movie w/ the black bars on top and bottom.) This is due to it's native resolution. For the price I feel that it was a very good investment and would recommend this to anyone who enjoys video games, sports and movies.
__label__1 unhappy: purchased this CD twice and neither one worked, I was looking forward to listening to this great music,however I do not recommend this purchase
__label__2 Batman: The fact that Batman wears an Ushanka and reminds me of a crazed terrorist was all I needed to see to make me want to buy this comic.
__label__2 Eye opening book!: This book was very different from all the others written about Edgar Cayce's readings. It was well put together and truly gave an amazing look into the story of Jesus not told everyday. Highly recommend this book.
__label__1 Good content - annoying audio production: While the content of the book is excellent, the production of the audio version is annoying. The clock ticking throughout examples, cheezy music, use of various voice-overs split through left right and channels, and other unneccessary audio gimics are really distracting, and actually make it more difficult to follow the dialog. While this type of format has long been the norm in business and non fiction audio productions in the 70's and 80's, I would expect a less annoying and updated format for an item produced in 1999. Read the book. Avoid the audio version.
__label__2 Great book!: This book came in so handy when it came to registering for all that baby stuff. Which, everyone that has done it knows how overwhelming it can be. It gave good advice on brands of baby clothing to furniture, to maternity websites. I highly recommend this book for those who love to shop, love to save money and who love to buy items worth every penny.
__label__2 Great: Yea this was the same, not spectacular acting but Kenny Rogers and the cast members were really good. Great movie
__label__2 A Testament to Faith: It's an powerful lesson that we all learn at some time when our faith is put to the test; the lesson that we must accept how little control we have over our own lives and that we must carry on with faith and hope. That's really what's going on in the Smarts' book. It's not Forensic Files, CSI, or Cold Case--It's not a tabloid fodder tell-all. I admire Ed and Lois for trying to put some dignity into the media circus surrounding their daughter.
__label__2 Another offering in the wonderful angel series.: Fr. Greeley again allows us to explore with him the marvelous interaction between the spirit (in struggle against its human constraints), God (as expressed through his angels), and the world in which these powerful forces act out life's play. The overall positive inflection of this story is tempered by the very real reflection of Man's virtures and vanities in a life and death struggle. I highly recommend this book for all those who not only enjoy a good tale well told, but who may find themselves reflecting on their own struggles.
__label__1 CK's no longer fit like always before: I've bought these Calvin Klein briefs for at least ten years and they've always fit perfectly, but this shipment definitely does not. they are to "short" .. they've decreased length, or amount of material between the waistband and legs, making you constantly want to tug them higher but if you do they pull around the legs at the bottom. uncomfortable. disappointing. guess I will have to find another brand.
__label__1 Do not consider buying this: What a dissapointment this pan turned out to be.After being delighted with the positive reviews I read,I could not wait to get the pan.Having used it for weeks now my enthusiasm has shrunk to zero.The most basic tasks are difficult to achieve.Meatballs stick to the pan and eggs don;t release propperly.Though always cook on medium high heat as recommended it tends to stick .Placed a smaller pan inside of it while storing and it left white scratch marks.Conclusion,do not buy! This is the bottom of satisfaction of any pan I have owned.
__label__2 One of my favorites: An amazingly funny book, Nude Men is the ultimate optical illusion story. Filapacchi has a great voice and is a powerful observer of human nature. I would recommend this book to anyone.
__label__2 One of the Best Ever: Is there any doubt that Carlos Santana is one of the greatest guitar players ever? I saw Santana several times during the "Welcome", "Love Devotion and Surrender" and "Caravanserai" years. Carlo's playing has always touched a very emotional chord with me. The playing is so lyrical and energetic.I bought Blues for Salvador based on the recommendations off Amazon and have been very pleased as the guitar playing is as good or better than anything Carlos has ever done. Blues for Salvador is wonderful!
__label__1 YOU CAN BE RICH TOO....not...: This book reads like an infomercial. YOU CAN BE A SUCCESS! GET RICH TODAY!! EASY STREET HERE YOU COME! Does it talk about the serious problems many start up's face? No. Does it talk about the large number of sites that have gone bankrupt? No. Does it talk about PROFITABLE businesses? Just Barely. This book is easy to read...and exciting to read...no doubt about that. But...it's not a good book. I suggest that you do some serious soul searching before you start a small business, and make sure NOT to read this book.
__label__1 Interesting at first, but then slow and gushing: I got the Kindle version of this, and I found the first several chapters quite interesting with the background on Edith Roosevelt's life- her early childhood growing up with T. R. in particular. But by the time we got to T.R. becoming governor of New York it was getting very slow, and although there were interesting highlights here and there, I was pretty much slogging through to the end. The author wrote in what I felt was a very gushing way about her subject, which became tiresome. The main information I took away from this book was that her step-daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, seemed like the most interesting female member of the family, and I'd like to read a book about her instead.
__label__1 bad puncture resistance: The tire is grippy on wet asphalt. But it's too fragile. I've got a through puncture after 3 commute rides. It was a piece of glass. While examining I've found a lot of surface punctures. I used 3 different brands among gatorskin. All 3 are better in terms of number of surface defects. May be it's the tradeoff for grippyness -- the rubber of gatorskin is softer and more elastic.I bought pair of gatorskins for commuting in winter when it rains. A lot of debris at expressways shoulders I ride. These ones don't work for me.
__label__2 very pleased on what they tell you: When I got this unit it was very easy to hook up as long you had a network system with a Hp computer set up. It came with a down load disk that was simple to use with a few steps to go through when the computer asked you what options for set up.I transfer all my files in my main hard drive to the media vault. freeing up lots of space in my main computer.One thing the media vault has an expantion bay for more memory space Hp should give more info explaining whats compatable to fit in this bay. I went on the notion that one could slide in one of Hp personal media drive units. As I found out you cant.Hp media center computers have a slot for the media drive why not the media vault.
__label__1 I thought they were too flimsy...: I didn't care for these boxes as they do not stand up once they are filled with magazines. I expected a higher quality for the price.
__label__1 Don't Try Releasing A Poor Live Album At Home: While I am a die-hard Spock's Beard fan, I question the decision to release a live CD that is only 50 minutes long with songs only from the last two albums. They easily could have fit "The Light" and/or "The Doorway" on here, the two definitive SB songs.The only song that sounds better on this CD than on the studio recording is "Gibberish". For some reason I can't get into that song in its studio form, but I absolutely love the live version. "Skin" also shines on this CD, mainly due to the added punch provided by 2+ people singing the chorus.I encourage anyone looking for a live album from Spock's Bear and order Live At The Whiskey and NEARfest.
__label__2 Still want more!: Ark of Truth wisely departs from the typical formula for the TV series episodes. Each of the team members undergoes a personal trial without the physical help or support of the other members. The drama and tension is successfully maintained until the end. Problem is if you liked the characters before, you may like them even more now! Naturally, another movie needs to be made....how about finishing off the Wraith in a crossover plot with the remaining SG Atlantis people!
__label__2 fit perfect - top quality: I love it. I'm a size 8 and it fit perfect. Just a little below the knee. Denim was really nice.
__label__2 This is the new style plate. Works great!: This is the new style of plate with the EZ-ject feature and Hornady does recognize Amazon as a distributor, so your warranty and rebates will be honored.
__label__2 For a Basset Hound: I have a 45 lb Basset Hound and if you have ever had one they stink to high heaven. Must be that special Basset Hound perfume. Having these dog wipes keeps that under control. I have to wipe out the folds in her neck and also her ears to make sure that the odor does not overtake the whole house. You sure know when she walks into a room. Haha She is such a cutey though that I will keep her and just make sure she is clean. Basset Hounds are hilarious.
__label__2 My go to sleep movie (in a good way!): It's called my go to sleep movie because I know it by heart, backwards and forwards, so it helps me fall asleep with some noise on insomnia ridden nights. The lines between Clooney and Pitt still crack me up - and watching it w/ commentary has never gotten old. Though I loathe the next too I will always love this one. And with my upcoming trip to Vegas, it helps get me pumped to hit the strip once more!
__label__1 So Average it hurts: If, as some of the people who've written reviews for this CD claim, they're true music aficianados, they wouldn't be gushing all over this CD like it's the second coming. News flash: it's not even the 9000th coming, OK? It's AVERAGE, that's all. She's AVERAGE. And hopefully, someone will take her place as flavor of the month soon. REAL soon. What's real interesting is that the same people drooling over this CD like it was honestly something special will be writing the same kind of reviews for whoever the next big hype is. If you feel you MUST have this record, like someone else said, wait a while and pick it up in the discount bins.... because it's DEFINITELY gonna end up there.
__label__2 classic thrash: if you like classic german thrash, like destruction, you'll love this Illinois band. little trivia bit for ya, the leads are played by the legendary Ben Meyer of Nasty savage, Gardy~Loo, Lowbrow, Acheron, etc. enjoy thrashers!
__label__1 A NO-BUY!: When I bought this video, I expected it to be great. I love kickboxing, and I have been dancing since I was three. (I am thirteen now.)I am an advanced dancer, and the moves were nearly impossible. This is not because they were too difficult, but they only show you the move once, and then go into "hyperspeed." Also, the awkward camera angles were horrible. Half the time they showed C-Note when I was trying to master the steps.C-Note is a joke. They talk about the ancient martial art forms when it is obvious they have no clue what they're talking about. And if I hear those guys say, "Y'all" one more time, I'm chucking the tai funk aerobics tape out the window. That movement with my arm would give me about the level of fitness I reached with C-Note.
__label__2 Fast Paced: I had read this book earlier in the year and as a promising new author, thought his first efforts were good and hope to see more of Drew Kane and Angela in the future. This is a book that once you start it, it is hard to put down. It is fast paced and also has those short chapters that I love so much.The only thing that would have made this book better for me, would have been a little more character development. But overall I would still give it 4 stars.
__label__2 Rock + Roll = White Stripes: I watched this DVD and I fell in love with rock 'n roll again, and maybe with Meg as well.
__label__2 One of the better tapes I've tried: This tape is the second best that I have used. It sticks fairly well and works as intended. I would recommend it over KT tape.
__label__2 Dara Joy has just become my favorite author: I just finished reading Mine To Take, then read Rejar. I know I read these kind of backwards but beleive me it did not matter in my enjoyment. Both books were wonderful. I can't recommend this series highly enough. The depths of these books boggles the mind when you read them together and see what she has done. Thank you Dara for such an unforgettable story.
__label__2 Great Gift for Any Dog Lover: A friend gave this to me on the one year anniversary of our standard poodle's death (at the ripe old age of 14). I'm glad I didn't read it sooner, but it was just right, right now. Touching, funny, warm and wonderful. I loved this lovely tribute to dogs everywhere - and their owners.
__label__1 Cracked in half: I used this stone 3 times. Halfway through my third use, I heard a tremendous snapping sound. When I went to take my loaf of bread out of the oven, the stone was completely broken in two like a ying yan.Not worth the money. Even if it's only $15.
__label__2 my bluetooth: I think this product is great! It comes with multiple ear pieces to fit anyones size. I have the freedom to do what ever I want while wearing this. I don't feel the dig behind my ears that previous bluetooth devices had given me.
__label__1 Terrible movie: It has a stupid plot - just natzis killing bedwins and bedwins getting even and it continues into a stupid violent movie of cold blooded killing. if you love violence watch this but don't waste your time - this movie is not worth the 3 bucks used DVD. The portrait of violence is ugly and upsetting.
__label__1 Includes the edited version of ROTJ.: This review is based strictly upon the edition details. The packaging states that Return of the Joker is 77 minutes (which is the uncut version), but is actually the 73-minute, "kid-friendly" edit.
__label__1 very poor. did not reveive the book ordered: This bookstore told me the book I ordered was sent but it never arrived. They did not inform me as to why
__label__2 A decent Roquefort, but not especially well-aged.: Vernieres is my staple brand for Roquefort, primarily because it is more readily available than other brands. This is a solid choice for most occasions if you're looking for a robust, pungent blue, particularly at this price, although a savvy shopper can find it MUCH cheaper if one knows where to look -- and I do. :) The only downside is that the typical Vernieres wedge or wheel tends to be underaged as Roquefort goes, not nearly enough bluing, and generally too much firmness/not enough softening of the texture. On rare occasion I can find a wedge of this brand very well aged indeed, and then it truly lives up to its reputation as the King of Cheeses. Yum!
__label__2 Works very well: The unit works exactly as I expected. It was easy to set up and adjust and it sure beats the tennis ball on a string. You can park within an inch or two of where you want to be very easily.The price was excellent and the delivery rapid.
__label__1 Is that all there is?: The begining of the CD was good, but the rest of the program did not impress me with the phrases they chose to teach. It left me looking for yet another French CD to learn from for just more of the basics.
__label__1 not what I recalled: I must've been mistaken about this band, because I recalled hearing something beautiful from them. But this was a dud. Nice cover though.
__label__1 Bad product: The tube started to leak in the second week. Was there any quality control? What can I say. It should not be sold.
__label__1 should have believed the bad reviews: i read all the reviews and figured i can be careful that the plastic seal is in place. and i was. each night i checked to make sure it wasn't curled up. then i made sure i closed it tightly but not too tightly. worked great for 2 weeks. i loved it. humidified the air silently. easy to clean. then one morning i got up and found it sitting in a puddle of water. ok, i thought, maybe i forgot to check that the ring was in place or didn't close it tightly enough. the next night i set it up a couple of hours before going to bed. i checked the plastic seal. i closed it reasonably tightly, made sure there was no dripping coming out before connecting it to the base. 2 hours late it was sitting on a lake. i'm done. returning it-- it's still within 30 days since i purchased it. so now i'm back on the market for a functional humidifier. it shouldn't be som damn difficult.
__label__2 A book for people of a certain age.: I am about the same age as Stephen King and have read his works throughout my adult life. I think most readers are too young to appreciate this book.Stephen King's early works, assembelled in chronological order, are all symbolic stories of stages in his own life. "Carrie" is about high school, "Salem's Lot" about love and loss in early adulthood, "The Shining" about the anxieties of fatherhood. "It" is about the reworking of childhood issues in mid-life. All great fiction talks to us on a subconcious level."Tommy Knockers" is about aging and death. Time possesses and mutates all of us, makes our teeth and hair fall out, truncates our dreams, makes us unrecognizable from our youthful selves. This is a sad book, and unlike King's earlier works the protagonists have no power to fight such an enemy. Affirming the value of love, however futile, in the face of death is the point of the book.
__label__1 Terrible Design Flaw: I've had these hood pins for a little over a year. During that time, I've had to replace two of the hood pin inserts as they somehow managed to 'fall out' while driving. I noticed my hood starting to ease up as I was merging onto the highway, stopped at the nearest autozone to replace the missing pin. About a week ago, I was driving on the highway when one of the pins shot out of the bolt. My hood immediately lifted up, ripping the entire other bolt out of the car, destroying my windshield. t-tops and carbon fiber hood. The topside frame of my car will have to be pulled out. Total of about $1100 in damage. Do not buy these. Invest in proper hood pins.
__label__2 Photos make up for the lack of technical detail.: The photos of tanks in action are superb. However the brief technical description of the tanks leaves you with more questions than answers as you read the book.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for historical photos of tanks. Look somewhere else if you want a detailed reference on tanks.
__label__2 Some feedback: Nice sturdy power supply. I bought it to hook up a car amp inside my house and i gotta say that i am disappointed because the current has a lot of feedback and creates static hissing sound, which does not happen when hooked up to a battery. I think if i hook it up to a battery with diodes, it will remove the noise though, so i give 4 stars.
__label__2 Wonderful Horror Novel ...a must read !: If you want actual horror then this is the book for you. This is the first book by King that i ever read and it caught me hook line and sinker and made me an instant King fan! The movie is pitiful compared to the book. Whatever you do , read the book whether or not you have see the movie. It beats all the horror movies i have seen or read. I loved it! It has plenty of humor also. You gotta love King's humor! This book will grab you from page 1. You wont be sorry you bought it!
__label__1 Very Disappointed in Product: The information on this product states that this item it will fit most RV's. Not so, not even close. There is no way to even motifiy this item to make it work. Was a total waste of money. I've had RV's for over 40+ years, and have never even seen a gutter even close to what this will fit. Not even worth sending back due to the shipping return charges being more that this product cost. Would not recommend this product to anyone. To bad you have even give it one star, in order to leave a review
__label__1 Good visuals but...: The visuals of this movie weren't bad, some of the special effects were actually quite good but everything else about the movie was horrible. The acting sounded forced (especially the Queen) and the writing was horrible as well. I wanted to like this movie even though it had Kristen Stewart in it but it was not good at all. Also, it wasn't very original. The beginning is fairly classic snow white and then there is a scene that, to me, seems like it was taken straight out of the movie Princess Mononoke (with the deer-like thing in the middle of the forest on an island and then gets shot by the evil people). If you want to watch this movie I suggest you jump to the middle and skip any parts with the evil queen in them.
__label__1 A movie is being made??????????: What the heck, this book, like all her others, really stinks. Janet's books are so stupid it's embarassing to be seen reading them.
__label__2 If you got the time to install, its a good purchase: Great item if you dont have power locks. I will warn you. The kit is complete but the installation is pretty challenging. Prepare to waste more time in installing than working to make money to buy it.
__label__2 Detailed and Intense: Very hard to put down.: After finding out that Hayduke really does live, I had to get his book to compare the real man to Abbey's character. Grizzly Years took me on a high adventure experience with "the man" himself. It was an increasingly intense experience with a climactic ending that seems as unescapable as Haydukes Jeep disappearing act in the Monkey Wrench Gang. I set a speed record reading this book. If you like primitive outdoor living in wilderness settings, then you at home reading this.
__label__1 Maybe better as individual stories than as a whole: The overall premise is fairly interesting: an alternate version of the world, all resulting from the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I. The book is a collection of short stories set in this world, showing how society functions within the scientific boundaries imposed by the Catholic Church. The individual stories are fairly well-written, especially the first. The big problem for me was my having settled into the premise of the book, and then getting to the end and realizing that things aren't what they seem. While I normally like surprise endings, the particular twist of this one was just too much to accept. I think readers would have a better time with the book A Canticle for Leibowitz, by Walter Miller.
__label__2 Excellent life advice: Under the guise of being about trading securities, this is an excellent book about life, about observing what work gives you and what it deprives you of. About making changes that lead to a richer life and how to know when work costs too much. It also offers wonderful insights into the life of a trader and the paradox of being a good trader and trying to balance that with being a good Christian.
__label__2 so magical !!: This is so magical !! I want more....when I first heard the music It sounded so familiar.
__label__1 Needs Some Work!: The first one I bought started smoking. The second one I exchanged it for only lasted about 6~7 hours with a set of top of the line brand new disposable batteries. I ended up returning it for my money back and then i went out and picked up a 100+ hour per charge iPod lithium battery pack from batterygeek which is working out much better.
__label__1 Never got the package on time: Wherever Amazon orders this product from -- never arrived for Christmas -- even when ordered 2 weeks before the holidays!
__label__2 A Classical Book Revisited!: The new edition of the book is written in the same manner as the first. New techniques have been added and the old material have been rewritten in a more educational way.This combination makes this book a perfect choise for a good start for beginners and a beauty to study for non.
__label__2 three and a half for a pretty good game: this is probably one of the better psp games you can buy at the moment, it seems as if it could go on forever with so many levels (even though i just go it with my psp 2 days ago). the story line is a bit difficult to follow so if you get games just for the story (why would you anyway) don't get this game, but for those of you who just want to do something for an hour or more this is the game for you.
__label__1 Very Mediocre Work: Snow Country is about a man who takes regular trips away from the city & goes to a little town in the "snow country" in northern Japan to have sexual affairs with the local geisha. On one of his trips, he sees a young woman & becomes attracted to her. The book has some beautiful imagry that makes me see the sights, hear the sounds & smell the smells of the snow country. But the book just doesn't have the ability to really draw me in to the character's lives. Instead of fascination, I'm only mildly interested. While the sensual imagry is beautiful, it's not masterful, as in a work like People In The Summer Night. I've read another work by this author, Thousand Cranes, and enjoyed it much more. I was really drawn into the world of the characters in that novel, but not here. Overall, I felt that this book, for the author & classic Japanese literature as well, was a letdown.
__label__2 100% COTTON MADE IN THE USA: We have been on a "quest" to find 100% cotton towels made in the USA and finally found them in the Bianca. We have some old towel also 100% cotton made in the USA that were made by Canon. Canon apparently outsourced and no longer make towels here (in the USA). That they are made in the USA isn't the reason we like these towels but that they really seem to absorb the best. By the best I mean compared to 100% cotton Turkish or Egyption towels. that don't seem to absorb - it's like they have undergone some kind of treatment that make them feel almost "waxy" and just move the water around.
__label__2 Great Book - Recommended Read!: This is a wonderful read. Brian Greene has a gift for explaining complex subjects in a clear and concise manner using good analogies. If you are interested in cosmology, this is a great book to read.
__label__1 "Casual Thinking": Man Ray is a band with an identity crisis. They sound like they would have rocked harder and more precisely, had Grunge never existed. But, it did, so they had to "dumb down" their sound and make it "rough around the edges" so it would be more accessible to the general public. This lack of trueness to one's self is evident in many bands of the post-Nirvana '90s. Candlebox is a prime example. They would have sounded like Skid Row, were they honest and courageous and had simply done what came naturally. Unwittingly, these bands paved the way for acts that were genuinely polished, yet "rough around the edges" such as Our Lady Peace or Matchbox Twenty. So do we ridicule them for their lack of integrity, or thank them for inadvertently spawning a popular genre? Either way, I didn't really enjoy this record. Thanks mainly to the vocalist and his "lyrics". The lead guitarist has excellent tone, though, and there are some solid, inspired moments, though not enough to genuinely impress me.
__label__1 Disappointed: I was really disappointed with this coloring book. The pictures are pretty new-age cheesy and there is so much black print in the pictures that there is very little left to color. It's like a collection of photo-copies of sci-fi/new age prints. Not very appealing, even to a Goddess-loving gal like myself.
__label__1 He did a song with Paris Hilton!!!!!!!!!!!: When will Fat Joe stop rapping? It is obvious that he struggling to pump some life into his failing career by doing songs with the most commercial artists he can find (Ja rule, Nelly, and the one that blew my mind PARIS HILTON). Fat joe now needs to do a song with the New Kids on the block, because all of his street credibility is gone. Maybe Wack Joe wouldn't suck so bad if Big Pun was still alive. This is a typical commercial album, sub par lyrics, stomach upsetting lyrics, and corny hooks. Who will Wack Joe work with next?!?!??!??!?!??! My vote is K-Fed, that collabo would be just as awesome as the one with Paris Hilton! LOL!
__label__1 I think this is bad!: It is just plain bad. I love Sonic and this really discouraged me of being a sonic collector. SO if you are just starting Sonic collecting, this is not the DVD for you. Start with Sonic Adventure 2 Battle, or Sonic X. Because Sonic Underground starts a new bad Sonic story. It is just Sonic as a kid. And beleive me, when he was a kid... That was his akward stage. Singing the happy song? What the?! Where did that that come from. If Sonic ever sand, it would be in a rock band. I think Sonic Underground is just plain old bad.
__label__2 Pampers diapers: I had been buying Huggies diapers until I ordered size 3, which when opened were the same as size 2. I switched to Pampers and the sizing has been consistant.They are also a better fit for a chubby baby and do not leak.
__label__2 Most Comfortable Socks I've Ever Worn!: These are extremely comfortable socks. They are seamless so they don't irritate my toes inside my shoes. They stay soft even after washing. I would highly recommend these.
__label__1 Worked great for three weeks: Motor is running but no mist is produced. Followed instructions for cleaning, but it didn't fix the problem. Considering other reviews describing this problem I plan to return this product for a refund.
__label__2 Interesting read on an interesting man: It is hard to believe that other people have not written about Richard Taylor, but they need not bother now that Parrish has written this book. This book on Taylor is engaging and interesting, but also very scholarly. Although Parrish's writing style can be dry at times, his topic does not allow the book to get mired in details or become boring. Instead, Taylor's life jumps off the pages and Taylor led such a life that we, the reader, get a great overview of pre-Civil War politics, the war in the Trans-Mississippi, and the Reconstruction Era. Normally, I find the pages on the time before and after the war somewhat boring, but this was not the case with this book. The whole book really kept my attention and was very interesting. Thinking back, I really cannot think of any criticisms of this work. Just a good, solid history book.
__label__2 Stop, look and listen: I'm not an Ally McBeal fan. When they aired the rerun of the episode which Josh made his first debut I was getting ready for work. I was already late but when Josh started to sing, I was so mesmerized by his voice there was nothing I would do but stop, look and listen.I got the cd a week ago and I haven't stop listening to this album, particularly "You still you" and "To where you are". Groban's voice is so strong and rich that you can't help but feel moved by his baritone voice no matter what language you understand and what language he sings.Music is the esperanto of souls, whatever your preference in music maybe if you don't love at least one song in this album then you're not really listening. I hope he'd make another album quickleee!The missing star on this humble opinion is because I wish there would be more songs like "You still you", "To where you are", "Vincent", and "Home to stay" - I'm not that literate :)
__label__2 Fantastic Prime Lens: I purchased this lens by the reviews on Amazon already. I use this lens on a Canon XTI and it is everything the great reviews have said.Very fast, even in very low light.Extremely sharp, Great color.I have been very happy with this lens and would highly recommend it as a must have prime lens, you will not be disappointed.
__label__1 Waste of money: This is a pamphlet masquerading as a book. It is a slim volume written in huge type with blank pages interspersing pages of text. I read it in about 15 minutes. There is very little information in it, and certainly not enough to justify the publication of a book. Do not waste your money.
__label__1 Don't work for my ears: I have a hard time keeping iPod buds in my ears. I bought these because of the locking mechanism. That mechanism does work but doesn't keep the bud far enough into my ear to generate reasonable bass. I also find that even with the smallest pad, my left ear hurts after 10-15 minutes. If I hold them in place I can tell that the sound is quite good but having to hold them in place kinda defeats the purpose. I'd suggest trying these out in a store to make sure they suit your ear shape before buying.
__label__1 should say "rip-off" in title: it was mostly the rambling of the author stroking his own ego than anything of actual information for my liking.I hated even giving it one star!
__label__1 Madonna: GHV2: I was disappointed - I was looking for dance music. The Confessions on a Dance floor that also purchased was much more useful overall and I think better. Madonna is reasonably well produced, puts a lot of energy into her work but it is not A work - somewhere between C/B with a few songs B+/A- - Hung Up is actually pretty decent and the single has some interesting re-mixes.
__label__2 One of my Favorites: This is one of my favorite shows and I tend to watch it over and over again. Although the shows are now on air all the time, I love having them all on DVD to watch.
__label__1 Believe the bad reviews - it broke my daughter's heart that this was one of her Christmas presents: I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. What a mistake. Please believe the bad reviews and do not purchase this product. First, the instructions are abysmal. The instructions begin by putting a fistful of clay into the device. There are no instructions that say what to do next. Common sense would dictate to take it out of the hole and work with it directly on the wheel but when you do so, it rips apart and has other problems. Further, the pictures on the box illustrate large, elaborate pottery that I doubt could be produced on this machine.Kid reaction - my son who was waiting for his turn became frustrated and said, "this is a bad toy". My daughter who is artistic and who has worked with pottery at school tried to make it work but it was no use. She too had to give up. This toy and bad Christmas present made my daughter sad.
__label__1 love my boppy instead: I guess I am one of the few people who don't love this nursing pillow. Perhaps it is b/c I used a boppy three years ago with my first child. I purchased this one thinking it would be helpful to be attached to me while I cared for my three year old and infant. I kept knocking into my three year old with the pillow! My infant couldn't get comfy at all on this pillow while nursing. The one thing I did like about it is the storage compartment (pocket) for different things.I bought this b/c my boppy seemed to be a little saggy and had seen better days. But in the end, I returned this and bought a new cover (which I know it doesn't really matter, but personally I think the covers are much nicer (pattern wise, etc.) for the boppy) for my original boppy and it is working great.
__label__1 EDA world: Very basic overview of the EDA world, less thorough than any "EDA for Dummies"...The book does not worth the money if you are already in that business.
__label__1 so disappointing and annoying: I really liked the first 2 books. But this book kept repeating the same things! I got tired of hearing about her ex Will , her wanting to be engaged to Jack and that thing about not having enough tomatoes in her salad seemed to go on too long. I really had to skim a lot of pages to get thru this. I was also disappointed in the way it ended. Still, I know I will end up reading the next book with hope that Wendy Markham will write it like she did the first two.
__label__1 Not enough power: After installing this backup sump pump I realized I made the wrong choice. I tested the pump after installation and the pump seemed to work, but could just barely keep up with incoming water during a rain. When I received my next water bill ($50 more than normal) I found that the valve was leaking. I contacted the manufacturer who stated that if my water pressure was greater than 60 psi the valve would not seal. They sent me a new valve at no charge but in order for the new valve to work properly I had to install a $40 water pressure regulator. After regulating the pressure to 60 psi the pump was essentially worthless. The manual states that with water pressure at 60 psi it will pump 317 GPH with 10' lift (not accounting for friction loss in pipes or check valves). If you think that sounds like a lot, a typical 1/2 HP sump pump operates at 3,200 GPH at 10' lift or a 1/4 HP battery sump pump operates at 1,000 GPH at 10' lift.
__label__1 Fake widescreen buyer beware!: This dvd release is not presented in the true aspect ratio the movie was originally filmed and shown in theaters in.All 4 sides of the frame are cut mostly the top and botton half of the picture to fit what looks like a full screen version to fit 16x9 widescreen tv.Dont the studio's get it? The reason people who want widescreen versions of film is so that they can see the full veiw of the picture frame the way the director intended.Thoes of us who want widescreen dont want any of the picture frame to be cut out out!Great movie, good picture qualtity apart from the cut apect ratio.
__label__1 Plain Insanity!!!!: I gotta say, this is just...nuts!!! He's dead. Need some more money GUYS!!! They can never get enough of it. The way it's coming my kid(s) (when i have some) will be watching sequels to this antique. The first was a masterpiece, 2 was ok, 3 is complete [garbage]. 4,5,6 are pretty decent (a little weird with the druid stuff I thought) H2O was the perfect ending. Why in the hell??!! I'll tell you why. Because "In the mouth of madness" and Halloween H20 were the best of the 90's. In the mouth of madness being the better of the two, that was pure genius.All that last summer [junk] and Urban legends belongs in a landfill.THEY will milk the series for all that it's worth...I can't wait for this to come out on dvd, then I'll really bash it.... OR (big if) take a knee and apologies....update October 15, 2002The only viewable portion is the first 10 minutes. Kill this character... let it die. Casting non-actors will not impress me.
__label__1 Poor Kindle version: The one star is for the Kindle version.I bought the Kindle version of Empires of the Word after preordering and waiting several months for the release. That was a mistake. The Kindle version is poorly prepared. Not only are all the maps absent, but many tables and quotes are missing. For example, the table comparing counting from one to ten in the three major Semitic languages is absent. The footnotes, as usual for Kindle, are difficult to follow. Some footnotes seem to be lumped together at the end of chapters.I gave up on the Kindle version and bought the paperback. Much better! This book is an excellent history of language. Unfortunately, the conversion to Kindle was sloppy. I am usually a big Kindle fan, but in this case Kindle turned an informative, enjoyable book into mush.
__label__1 oh this isnt good: great for a kid but not a teenager. This doesnt listen through walls or windows. They say it goes 30 feet...actually 10. It's not meant to provide good results just enough for a kid to hear his heart beat.
__label__1 Matewan: phenomenal movie, terrible dvd: I can only comment on Matewan, since it's the only one I've watched, but is is abundantly clear that whoever produced this DVD did the cheapest job of it they could. NO subtitles, NO special features, wrong aspect ratio, crappy sound, *terrible* picture quality, etc. I'm not a videophile and this is the first time I've ever been so disappointed with a dvd. Incredible movie though.
__label__2 The best diet for life: This is the easiest, simplest and nutritionally complete diet I have ever followed. Once you get the basics in chapter 2 you are on your way to a healthy and satisfying journey through the diet maze. Food choices and portions are explained in an easy to follow manner. No scales, calorie counters or physics degree needed. Just pick your food categories and enjoy!
__label__2 Works as advertised: Does what it says it does. I had a little problem with the length. Keep in mind this is only about 6 inches long. I had to really stretch to make it fit on the back of the radio. The antenna connector was on the opposite side of the radio as stock, so your mileage may vary.Used in 2006 Legacy 2.5i with Pioneer DEH X6500BT
__label__1 Not my style: I couldn't really get into these books. I finished them, but I wouldn't read them again and won't continue with the rest of the series.
__label__2 YOUR LOVE IS MY LOVE!!!!!!: YOUR LOVE IS MY LOVE GIRL BUT IF YOU LOSE BOBBY YOUR LOVE WOULD BE BETTER THAN JUST A SONG DROP THAT ZERO AND GET A HERO!!!! STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK WHY CAN'T YOU.....
__label__2 very good design.i like the color but i hope to find bigger desigen: i like the color but i hope to find bigger desigen from this multicoclored logo from aigner as soon as possible with wallet and keyfob or key chain
__label__2 really super to smooth out hair without weighing it down (if you have fine or thin hair): use about a quarter size dollop and run thru wet hair and then blow dry...will help smooth out slightly kinky hair (my hair has more grey in it now and appears slightly wiry while still being fly away hair even though it is colored. Also helps with humid days....use more if hair is thick--leaves hair polished looking without weighing it down and keeps it from being fly-away frizzy
__label__2 l0 minute solution tough but good: I have several other pilates dvds, including another l0-minute one. The reviews I read on this one before purchasing indicated it was a little tough for beginners, but I love it - it does stretch you & make you work but I just keep at it & back off if it's too much occasionally. If you want to be serious about toning, this will help.
__label__2 Very Inspiring: This was the first time I ever watched the Biggest Loser. I missed all the seasons up to this one but came across this one night and thought it would be interesting to view. It did not hurt I was nine months pregnant and wondering if I would ever be a normal weight. I was not disappointed. I could not stop watching this season once I started. I was so inspired by the contestants and truly amazed at the progress they made on the ranch. I laughed, cried and realized that anyone can make changes in their life if they just believe. Since I started viewing this I have used several tips throughout the show and I am noticing changes in my family members as well. It really is motivating and a great watch.
__label__2 The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You'll Ever Need: As with all his other book's Larry Swedroe has filled this book with wonderful advice. I found his presentation of the need to take risk (pages 176-178) and the risk and return of fixed income assets (pages 118-120) particulary useful.
__label__2 Too Funny: As always the stream was great and this show was awesome! I could not have picked a better day to watch this one. You need to be ready to be silly and want to have fun.
__label__1 Not much to recommend: At first, this CD sounds promising. It reminded me of the Dream Academy, with lush string arrangements supporting understated, breathy vocals. Then, the next song sounds about the same. And the next. And the next...After a while, the whole thing sounds extremely self-conscious and contrived. The airy vocals start to grate after a few listens, until you want to scream, "Let's hear some dynamics, already!"This album went nowhere, probably for good reason.
__label__2 A charming, witty, honest read about one man's journey......: This book was...well, it was a great read. Mr. Whitcomb describes His 1960s odyssey in great detail, with the honesty and ignorance of an outsider. It has heartbreaks and troubles, and miniature and near triumphs, at least that seems to be how the author sees some episodes in His life. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know what the music scene in the early 1960s was like from a non-hippie across-the-pond musician point-of-view, anyone who likes good, true stories, and also to anyone with a sense of humour.
__label__1 Doesn't work with Samsung S3: I recently got this luxmo universal car vent holder to use with my phone and it will not work with my Samsung S3,
__label__2 Would buy another one.: I had the SD card version before this and loved it. The CF version holds 4 cards but it keeps them snug in the case. It stows easily in my pocket. Not overly bulky. I will buy another one when I need more storage for future CF cards.
__label__1 First Memory Card To Fail: Normally, I don't write reviews on memory cards because I never had any fail on me. It always just worked with no issues. Transcend will be the first one to take the crown, but it's the "first-to-die crown". We had this card for about 2 years but only used it maybe 4-5 times (light use). On the 5th time, we took our camera with this Transcend card to Cozumel and it just stopped working after about 20 photos. I'm sad to report that the first half of our trip is now officially lost. Thanks Transcend. I now know why your prices are cheap.
__label__1 For what it's worth..my two cents: Like others who have posted here, this book was recommended to me with great fanfare. As someone who is a Christian, I looked forward to reading it with the hope that it presented a message which could be shared with my friends and family who are not Christian. Was I ever disappointed. And even more to the point, I was embarassed. This book is full of cliches, some of the most uninterestng characters I have ever experienced in litertature, and numerous (too many to name here)plot discrepencies. As a believer we are challenged to spread the gospel, this book does nothing to further the gospel in the eyes of the non-believer. My greatest concern is that any non-believer would foreever be flabbergasted at the simplistic writing style exhibited in this book.My recommendation is to spend time reading the Bible and let God's grace speak to you. This did nothing of the sort to me.Regards,
__label__1 Good cd player but not great: was told when i purchased the cd player that it had non-skip capility but it does not and skips all over the place when it is bumped, so you have to play it on a surface that does not move.
__label__2 A side of Iran I've never seen.: This documentary was extremely interesting and sad. What the young girls have to do to survive is depressing. There were times where I felt angry that the mother was endangering her child but I had to remind myself that their culture is different. All in all, I highly recommend this documentary.
__label__1 You've gotta hand it to her, she's a great lip-syncher...: If Mariah Carey is such an incredible vocalist, then why are some songs on this video lip-synched?
__label__2 This is what I am talking about!!!!!!!!: As I read this book, I kept saying "Yep, yep, that's true, that's true. Hun, yep, true that". Strongly recommend this book to any woman. It will make your dating/marriage life a better experience full with loving moments.Dr. Israel King,Ph.D. Author ofHow To Keep A Man
__label__1 Buy this if you dont care if it works and cant be returned.: I received this product timely but its completley non functioning. The battery compartment was broken. This was right after it was opened. Also, be aware you cannot return this product. Its an expensive piece of trash now.
__label__2 Great help for arthritic hands: Because I have arthritis in my hands, this tool has become my favorite for the yard & garden! I use the short attachment to edge areas where the lawn meets ground covers or planting beds (and a string trimmer would be too severe), and recently used the long shearing attachment to successfully trim six inches off the top and sides of some large and dense, unruly evergreen bushes. I also used it to easily trim boxwoods. On my most recent use, it ran for more than an hour of constant use without needing a recharge. The attachments are very easy to interchange.
__label__1 Disappointing: I was determined to like this book and gave it my best shot, but found I couln't bring myself to finish it. Yes, it's witty, but it's also hopelessly dated. The fifties had come and gone long before I was born, so I confess that many of the cultural references went right over my head. If you are looking for a spoof on academia, you're better off reading David Lodge or Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim.
__label__2 Truth and Hope for the Struggler: If you are struggling with homosexuality then this book is for you. The choice is not whether you have same sex attraction or not, but rather how do you want to live your life. Seeking God and His purpose for your life comes first and then this book clearly shows the struggler and his family how to make intelligent choices that will bring fulfillment and peace. Step by step, this book answers some very tough questions and describes very clearly a new perspective to the person who is unhappy living as a gay person. Richard Cohen has written a masterpiece in education and I can't wait to read his next book, "Healing Heterosexuality".
__label__1 PAW PAW LOUISIANA: PROS; NONECONS;THIS CLIPPER GETS TOO HOT TO THE SKIN TO FINISH ONE HAIR CUT ALSOTHE HOTTER IT GETS THE LOUDER IT GETS.
__label__2 Total Gym DVD review: Received item on time and in great condition. There are different chapters for men and women which is helpful. Exercises are tailored to people who are beginning exercise with the Total Gym, which is good for me.
__label__1 Short review: I found this a boring film. There was no new insight to the world of the adolescent. If you are a big fan of high school synchronized swimming teams, you may well enjoy the film.
__label__2 All of Kiss's best songs: Almost all the classic Kiss songs are on this set. Its a great cd it rocks hard. Its the best of from 1974-1982 to me being the golden years of kiss's carrer. This is all kiss before they took the makeup off its a great album, great for beginning fans or people who want an album kiss that includes their best songs. I think they should come out with a volume 2 kiss gold please click yes or comment on this reveiw if you agree with me.KISS
__label__1 Worst. Pixar. Film. Ever (but kids will love it): Over the past years I've seen and loved every Pixar film. When this originally came out, it just didn't look interesting to me. However, since Cars 2 is coming out, I thought I should finally watch this. I should have stayed with my initial feelings. This is the stupidest Pixar film ever. It looks pretty, sure, but the concept and story are strictly for 3 year-olds. There's nothing for the adult viewer here. The average Chevron commercial has a more entertaining story. This movie is literally sleep-inducing. But little kids who like mindless zooming things will love it.
__label__1 Just say no!!!!: Don't be fooled people. What type of thanks is this to fans of this series who have already supported LOTR in the theaters and on DVD...some twice. Now when everyone has been waiting and waiting to buy this on Blu-ray, they pull this nonsense and give us the incomplete version. No way. I'm quite happy to own my SD version and will continue to enjoy that as long as required.
__label__2 Always a classic...: This is the third set of Chronicles of Narnia that I have bought for my daughter over the years. She is 19 now and pregnant and has reread the series until the books fell apart. Now that she is about to have a child of her own she wanted another set to read to her baby.This series is truly a classic that will be read for generations to come.
__label__1 Plastic!: This American Standard handshower wall bracket is described at various sites as chrome-plated brass. I ordered it along with 2 chrome Kohler Forte robe hooks. All arrived today. The wall bracket is in fact worthless plastic and will have to be returned. The Kohler robe hook is heavy chromed brass, nicely made, so I immediately went online to a Kohler wall bracket that looks like the American Standard one--sure that I'd find it to be brass--and found customer statements saying, contrary to claims, it too is plastic. Are the manufacturers lying? What would be the point? It's not as though we can't tell the difference. I now don't know where to find a legitimate handshower wall bracket in this style.
__label__1 Rip Off: This is a fake. It's not the same fragrance. The bottle looks right, but the top rattles, is scratched and is not attached properly. The scent is the same. They are printing bottles, and boxes, and bottling with something similar. This is a total rip off. Amazon should be ashamed that this seller is on their site, DO NOT BUY.
__label__1 Cheap, rushed movie tie-in garbage!: I am very sorry that I spent any money at all on this game. The production quality is bad and the gameplay itself is sloppy and boring. Feels like it was rushed to market. I couldn't even be bothered with it after the 2nd level. One of the lamest games I have planned in years! Avoid at all cost!!!
__label__1 Planetarium Gold Gift Set: I purchased this product and found it to be: 1. Cheesy, 2. a waste of money, 3. less than helpful and 4. the CD made a good coaster for my ice tea. The graphics is poor quality 1980's EGA. I also found it most difficult to follow given the number of errors I located. I should have known better when I saw the name of the company that published it: FOGWARE.
__label__1 DANGER: I have a Chihuahua and a Boston Terrier, one out weighing the other by 10 lbs give or take a little. You must have dogs of equal weight or strength because the boston pulls the chihuahua around and the chihuahua kept getting strangled and pulled all over the place. I ended up having to pick up the boston and let the other one have a minute to take his time to go to the bathroom. What a waste
__label__2 Very good Story: Most of you seem to rate this low because you think he hurried it, and tried to get it out too quickly. This is because you feel he leaves too much open, as to "What happens next". I guess you dont expect him to make another in this universe, or you are all to ignorant to even bother understanding the hard work it takes to continue in one particular setting, you must keep the reader wanting more And I, for one, believe his next book (In the Uplift Universe) will be the best by far.
__label__2 Great Perspective: I've enjoyed several history books about Detroit and seen pictures of how things looked 100 years ago, but I could never put these photos in current day context until I got this book. As you open this book you'll notice a historic photo on the left page and on the right you'll see the very same location but with the current day buildings in place. This is a "must have" book if you want to learn more about the history of Detroit. Impressive coffee table book too.
__label__1 Terrible: I understand that some movies are "classics," but that doesn't necessarily make them good. There were no likable characters in this film, no one to relate to, no story or plot, it's just following this womanizing guy in a downward spiral who goes around town in this nonsensical fashion meeting all these strange people that you never see again. It doesn't make any sense. I guess it's supposed to be ironic--that what people think would be "The Sweet Life" is anything but, but I didn't need 3 hours of terribleness to portray that irony.
__label__1 Chain saw sharpener: Over all not bad for the price but when you want to change the grinding wheel it is very hard to keep the wheel from spinning. Fortunatly you don't have to change the grinding wheel all that often.
__label__1 Disappointed: Just to keep it short, graphics sux compared to allied assault, the ammo is scarce the germans are plenty. Just way too hard for easy or medium. Spearhead was short and the game play is way better. It's just best to say "SAVE YOU MONEY" for something else.
__label__2 Throw away disc 1 and it's even better.: One of the great music experiences ever.Some of the greatest musicians of all time playing together.Tribute to George Harrison.Disc 1 is a sitar orchestra. Watch it once and say, "That's interesting", then throw it away.Disc 2 is incredible. If you can watch Billy Preston doing "My Sweet Lord", Sam Brown on, "Horse to Water", and Eric Clapton on, "When My Guitar Gently Weeps" and not be moving your body, check for a pulse.Hell, the backup players include Paul McCartney, ELO's Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Ringo Starr.Just get it, thank me later.
__label__1 Conservative propaganda unfit for publication: Give me a break. The ignorance of 50% of this country is startling (kinda) and sad (very).....
__label__1 More fodder for Dilbert comic strips: To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander. The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited. Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".[...]
__label__2 One of the funniest movies ever!: South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, if not the funniest. I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it.And while there are plenty of "in" jokes for fans of the TV show, if you've never seen South Park on TV, you'll still be laughing so hard you'll cry.
__label__1 Its gets progressevly more boring until it dies.: This movie starts off blazing hot and ends up ice cold. Martin does a great job with Nick Nolte as an artist in "life lessons" and i thought after this story that i was in for a real treat of a film but after watching Ford Coppolas somthing Zoe i began to tire and by the end of Woody Allens snoozefest i was bored stiff. My advice is to watch the first 30 minutes and then turn this one off. The first 30 minutes is GREAT film followed but very average film and ending with truley awful film.
__label__2 A good and practical book: I really enjoy using this book. It is easy to find the characters. Each character has a brief description about its meaning, its ancien form, some examples of its use, and the most important: the stroke order.
__label__1 The Cult of Anti Paulims and its book: be careful reading this book. Yes it sounds convincing and starts to make sence, unless you actually know the bible. The author takes everything about Paul and reads it out of context. He has no sense of history , or cultrual ways of anyone in his writings. He fails to cross reference situations properly. Search throughout history and you will find that no person in the church has written anything saying Paul was not an apostle. This is simply a cult teaching that you can work your way to God, no more and no less. same beliefs as JW's, mormons etc.
__label__2 Suspenseful.: Very entertaining. Holds your attention throughout the movie. Russel Crowe was excellent as the lead. I would recommend this movie..
__label__1 Why buy these codes?: You can purchase these points directly from your console at $01.25 per point. It appears to be the same price at the store as on your console.1000 = $12.501600 = $20.004000 = $50.005000 = $62.50
__label__2 Somewhat disappointing: Not up to the usual standards of W.E.B. Griffin. Characters were a little weaker as was the plot. Some inoffensive sex tossed in that is not usual for an author of this caliber.
__label__2 A slow read but packed with information.Fascinating.: I'm usually a pretty fast reader. This book, however was an exception. I found myself fighting to plow ahead in parts and had to re-read many others. Very logically laid out and interesting. Despite it's difficulty, I loved it.
__label__2 Gospel Truth: One of the happy outcomes of The Da Vinci Code phenomenon is a wider awareness of the "Gnostic Gospels". Publishers have not been slow to respond, but this precious volume towers above the crowded scene along with its companion titles in the series: the Gospels of Thomas and Philip. The French admire and understand these long-lost Scriptures and Leloup uniquely combines mystical insight with scholarly wisdom. The big problem is that other most editors and commentators "leave the track" because they are one or the other. Your best guide is qualified in both fields! Take this book to your heart.
__label__2 Sweet Book: Its been a long while since I was in high school and this story really took me back to those times. It wasn't a very long book, but it still took the time to let Ivy and Zak to get to know each other. It was a story about growing feelings between two kids in high school, but it didn't talk down to the reader. There could have been more time for character development, but the guts of the story - the heart of the story - was very sweet. I'm a big fan of interracial romances with BW/WM and I recommend this one.
__label__1 Fat Burner disaster: Did not increase my metabolism nor did I lose 1 pound and I took all 60 pills. It was a waist
__label__2 Diaper Champ beats all others!: This is the best-designed diaper pail. All you have to do is drop in the diaper and turn the handle. There is nothing to push or twist. And because it is taller than most other diaper pails, you don't really have to bend over. It also traps in odors well. My sister-in-law had a Safety 1st diaper pail and my cousin had the diaper genie, but they both eventually wound up getting the Diaper Champ, which they love. Also, because you can use any plastic bag, there are no expensive refills to buy, so it's also a money saver. If you need to get a diaper pail, I urge you to check out this item. I highly recommend it!
__label__2 WHAT REAL LOVE MEANS: I loved this heart inspiring movie from begining to end. When Virgil ( real name is Shirl ) and is about a true life couple that live in Atlanta, Ga.The most poignant part was when Virgil told Amy he did not want his sight back to learn to ride a bike, ' He just wanted someone to NEED HIM .' How could that not touch anyone's heart. As for the woman that got hers from a $5.99 sale bin & did not like it, does not have a heart. Rebecca Evans
__label__1 Not that great: This book is not very good. It basically repetes the same information many times. For example, it gives the species descriptions twice, but only has about five sentances on a proper cage for a conure. Even w/ the descriptions, it didn't talk about the specific conures traits and personality, only how big it is and where it can be found in the wild. Not even if it is readily available as a pet or if that species is on the verge of extinction, therefor you can not make any judgement at all, wheather that bird will make a good pet. I have read many parrot books and the is nothing specificly on conures in this one. In my opinion, the author just wrote about parrots in general, replacing the word "parrot" with the word "conure". The only interesting thing in this book was the pictures which gave it the extra star, otherwise it would have only gotten one.
__label__1 Cable breaks very easily: I just have it for a couple weeks and the first time I pulled from it the cable broke and there is no easy way to fix it. I had other brands of headsets and they have last me for years, but this one was extremely easy broken. I mean, the headset is fine but the part were the two cables join in one is not fuse so every time you pull by accident from them you are pulling on the inside cables.Therefore, extremely easy to break.
__label__2 Goes into detail: I didn't know what to expect from this book as the first book details the food plan fairly well, although it had been reccommended to me. I am glad I ordered it. The first several chapters detail Harvey's quest to find a way of eating that would work for him, and is inspiring and interesting to know that other people, ie we all, have problems with food.I like the details and additional information he provides about why this eating program is so effective. Anti establishment health and diet advice at its best. I have already read the first book and know that this way of eating does work to bring one to an optimal energy level just as described. All those good anti-oxidants and enzymes!!!
__label__1 Home Repair: If Ken can't figure out that his dumper strategy is best sold short in a bear market, then I have no faith that his bull market guruship can last into 2002, and the outdated methods in this book prove it. Aside from a few useful comments about tape reading, I'd put the book under the broken table leg to hold it up and give it one star.
__label__2 Excellent: Excellent and easy to use. I had a pair for over 10 years and they were great, but got left in a hotel room. I'm glad I was able to find a replacement
__label__1 I regreted it once I opened the cover of the book: I am an engineer in the networking industry. The whole book is filled with a little of everything, from "Queueing Theory", TCP/IP, to some "Advanced Topics" such as VPN and MPLS. From the technical point of view, in none of these areas, the book gives enough details for anyone to obtain sensible understanding on those technologies. Yet from the conceptual point of view, the author fails to make a proper connection and present a big picture. This is supposed to be an SLA book, but throughout the book I could not find any example of a practical and comprehensive SLA.
__label__2 Loved it: One of my favorite novels written by Lori Foster. I really liked the emotional and physical variables that she brought to the story. This is a great read and worth the money, and you will continue to read over and over again. I only wish she would write another novel about Ray's younger brother. Oh well a girl can dream.
__label__1 DVD tray wouldn't open right out of the box.: I bought this primarily because of it's small foot print. Other DVD/VCR combo units are much larger. As soon as I got it home and connected it up I tried to open the DVD tray to play a DVD. The tray wouldn't open. It's going straight back to Best Buy first thing in the morning. What a piece of junk!!!!
__label__2 Perfect Pedagogical Purchase !: Need THE perfect gift for someone (beside yourself) that is in teaching/ about to begin teaching/ education administration ?? This is it! Hurst covers topics from the insiders point of view to that of the children she loves. A real eyeopener for the parent about to send a child into an educational setting. You'll love this book. The cartooning style makes the message all that more forceful. It's a BUY !
__label__2 Princess Diaries: This was a gift for my stepdaughter. Have seen the movie previously and enjoyed it. She wanted it; she got it.
__label__1 Purchase something else: A friend gave me this to use for my laptop and PC. It will not work unless both the pc & laptop are turn on.
__label__1 Not for working out: I have been using these for several months. I am constantly having to deal with them popping out of my ears. I don't think the sound quality is all that great, either. Overall, I am just not happy with them.
__label__1 Very disappointing: Had no power and wouldn't push the cookie dough out. I will try it one more time but wish I had saved my money.
__label__2 Hitman: A real shoot em up. Not for the squeamish as there are plenty of blood highlights. Action packed and loaded. Not for kids.
__label__1 ripped off: I am frustrated and extremely angry with this dealer, I placed this order Dec.31 2008. Please understand my bank account was debited on Jan 5th. After ample time elapsed I inquired..Where is my merchandise? A few more weeks...again an inquiry..where is my merchandise? And yet no merchandise and NO reply after polite inquiries. Fine, if its held up just keep me in the loop but nothing. So here we are in Feb and again I put out a request to cancel the order but have no reply. And being such a sucker and using an outside vendor Amazon cannot help me recoup my loss. By now it's more than the money it's the principle of it. So if you are considering using this vendor DON'T!! I suppose this is the best recourse I have. At least it may help someone else. (Actually is 0 stars but the system wouldn't take it.)
__label__2 True to Life Depiction: This is one of the best World War II movies I have ever seen. In actuality, I bought it so I could do research for a WW II short story I'm writing for the Dance En L'Air anthology being released at the end of this year. I never planned on enjoying the movie as much as I did. As someone whose father served in WW II, it means a lot to have such a true depiction of the times.
__label__1 "Repellent." You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.: I applied the entire quart bottle to an area about 10 sq meters over a period of 2 weeks. Before application, the voles LOVED my grass. I had so many repeat customers they had literally worn a trail to their favorite booths. I thought that my lawn would never be able to support more clientele. Boy, was I wrong! After application of Bonide's Molemax, the voles doubled in number and voracity. They loved this stuff so much, they started leaving 5-star reviews on Yelp! about my yard. They told all their friends about the magnificent new sauce on my lawn and absolutely devoured it. In'n'Out was ranked 2nd behind my lawn in popularity by voles in my area.The 1 star is for the name of this product. It says "repellent" but what it actually does is the complete opposite. Note that the voles ONLY ate the grass where Bonide's Molemax was applied. They didn't even touch a blade anywhere else.
__label__1 uhhh ok: Leon claims to be responsible for preventing the destruction of the leaning tower of pisa. but in actuality, it was a man named Young Oak Kim, who was recently declared by msn.com as one of the 16 greatest american war heroes.He was a member of the U.S. 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team, and a combat leader in Italy and France during World War II. He was awarded 19 medals, including the Distinguished Service Cross, two Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars, three Purple Hearts, a Bronze Medal of Military Valor, a Légion d'honneur, a Croix de guerre, and (posthumously) the Korean Taeguk Cordon of the Order of Military Merit.*where is Leon's merit acknowledging his heroism? lol. he doesnt even have a wiki page. he's a skilled writer, making CASH off his first hand experience. YOUR MY HERO LEON. you crazy reptillian you.
__label__2 Look out wood here comes the Bosch sander!: AFTER USING IT A WHILE, I would only give it three (3) Stars because the punching plate that punches holes in the sandpaper does not work well, it tears instead of punches clean holes... The Makita has a much better punch plate but it is noisier and does not have as nice a filter/dust bag...It looks small but it really sands wood and everything else with little noise and vibration. In short it's a joy to use and it even has a easy to use hold down system that makes changing sandpaper fun!
__label__1 Gross misinformation!: Emory University, Bellesiles' (ex)home, convened an investigation and has declared this book to be fraudulent, and has forced Bellesiles to resign. A national committee is now being formed to investigate Bellesiles further. If you want valid information, this is not the book you want. The resource information was found to be fabricated, and his conclusions to be a fantasy.
__label__1 worst printer ever made!: My poor grandfather owns this printer. Every other week he needs my help with this horrible printer. The cartridges slide back and forth noisily with any requested task -it takes forever to print, it jams every time. The yellow light flashes signaling a paper jam of which there never is, this is just a piece of crap . I helped him to order another thinking we maybe just had a lemon...the second one was just as bad if not worst. Don't waste your frustrations on this one. I would recommend a HP laser jet printer and separate scanner and fax. This is by far the worst all-in-one I have ever used!
__label__1 Oops - very dodgy printing, beware!: This is an excellent text, if you can get your hands on it. This reprint offered by University of Michigan Library, in association with Google printing, is so poorly produced that the entire book will arrive to you completely filled with blank pages. LOL Amazon is awesome and is refunding without me sending it back, so at least I have a new notebook... look for an original, or an original reprint.
__label__1 Didn't buy it: Because of the negetave coments on this item regarding feedback noise, and even though my primary use is for CD/MP3 books and not music, I didn't buy it. Instead I purchased the one from Radio Shack, part number 273-353 that was suggested by one of the reviewers. There is no feedback noise associated with this power adapter, in either music or CD mode.
__label__2 Great Film by Great Film Director!: This is a wonderful film which was the basis for O'Brother, Where Art Thou? by the Coen Brothers years later. A wealthy film director decides that his comedies are trivial and he must make an "important" film about the lowest classes in the United States. He poses as a hobo and travels California to get to know the lowest classes, at one point meeting Veronica Lake. His lark takes a turn towards reality when he loses his money and ID and ends up truly living the life of a hobo including time on a chain gang.
__label__1 Generic songs from a great singer...: OK,,,Chris CAN sing, but it seems that THEY got a hold of him and his album is so typical, its disgusting. There isnt one shred of originality on it. I cant believe the SOOOOO generic "Its all over" is now number 1. I guess American Idol fans must be blinded by lack of orginality. I hope Chris can get past this crap, and really ROCK, like I know he can.
__label__2 Another great Destroyer album: Well, they did it again. Destroyer can do no wrong. This record is a little more artsy than "Streethawk" but the great hooks are still there. It seems like they wanted to shake away all of the Bowie comparisons, and they did a great job of it while maintaining their style and distinct sound. Fans of Destroyer will not be disappointed, nor will people who've never heard them. If you are new to Destroyer, I would recommend buying "Streethawk" first, but if you're into more experimental rock/pop buy this one immediately. "Streethawk" is a lot more accesable and lives up to the "Hunky Dory" references.So to make a long story short, Destroyer is a wonderful band and definitely worth checking out. This is a record that definitely gets better with time (even though it's great on the first listen) and if I had written this review 2 weeks from now I would probably give it 5 stars.
__label__2 Concise, organized and spiritually enriching: As a teacher of the Bible since 1948 I have studied under some of God's choice writers of commentaries. I find Dr. McGee's most helpful in presentation of truth in an organized way, useful for students of God's Word, and with rich spiritual content. He always writes enlightening and blessed truths which are easily assimilated. Among the many commentaries I use, he remains at the top of my list.
__label__1 Serbo-Croat??? No way!!: This book will not teach you the Serbo-Croat language, it is merely a course for the new Croatian dialect, as it has been formed in the last few years. It made me wonder why a course like that keeps the title "Serbo-Croat"...
__label__1 Dogora will bore ya!: This ToHo movie will do what most Japanese films never do and that's bore the hell out of you. Dull Dull Dull. An alien that eats diamonds shows up and mucks up diamond robbers. Too much diamond robber stuff too little monster.
__label__1 do NOT buy this book as an introductory text!: i am currently enrolled in a course for which this is the required text and have found this book to be all but totally useless. this is the first semester the text is being used and the professor has already decided to switch textbooks for the next semester. i am placing an order for michael sipser's textbook in hopes that i can still salvage my grade in this course. in summary, this book is a waste of paper, both literary- and money-wise.i hope this insight is useful to other undergrad students who are in the same situation.
__label__2 Perfect for sensitive skin: I'm very sensitive to the various chemicals contained in most shave cream, so I'm very happy with this product and will be purchasing again.
__label__1 DISAPPOINTED: I have a hard time believing this was put out by the same people who did all the other Buddies movies. My kids thoroughly enjoy the Buddies movies. I will not allow my children to watch such a sinister movie as this one. Shame on you for putting out such a Demonic film.
__label__2 affordable but good quality: affordable but good quality.wider angel than bullet cams and has a better pic than the ones that my kit came with.Good color and has great night vision.
__label__2 Master episodes particularly WICKED: I very much enjoyed this season 3. 1 and 2 were great too, no doubt. But this was a whole new level. The Master episodes were just wicked. But there were other great episodes. Next best was Blink, which if Stephen King were to write a Dr. Who episode, this is probably what he would come up with.
__label__2 The Zohar is the ultimate way of eliminating chaos in our world: i have read these books and have been sooo overly energized with LOVE for all people and for the world. I am so exicted to get the bigger picture about why i am here, i have been searching for that my entire life and finally i found it.
__label__1 Avoid this book: Unless you want to read a political rant thinly disguised as a novel, don't buy this book. There is very little story here and what there is borders on being silly. I thought I was going to be reading about a woman discovering herself. That certainly isn't what happened. What you will get is a lesson in what a women's festival is supposed to be about (according to this author), the divisions among lesbians, racism, male bashing and some extended gnashing of teeth about daughters of Holocaust survivors. The main conclusion I came away with was that, if this is how women's festivals are conducted, I'm glad I haven't been to one. The "mystery" in this has a ridiculous conclusion. None of the characters are well developed. This book isn't worth the cost, even at the used price. It took me about two hours to read the whole thing. I'm disappointed that Amazon recommended this turkey. Save your money.
__label__2 Fun for Both Adults and Children Alike: If you are a lover of a play on words, a mind teaser and a great fairy tale, you will love this book. But, don't jump to conclusions or you may find yourself suddenly standing on the "Island of Conclusions"! What a fun read and thoroughly enjoyable. It now has a fond place in my collection of Fairy Tales.
__label__2 Most treasured book I have: This book may be difficult for some to read because of the Gullah dialect, but once you grasp the dialect, the Bible explodes with color and simple down to earth meaning. I often have to stop and wipe tears from my eyes. I feel I am reading the Bible for the first time and just can't put it down.
__label__2 Over-looked Classic: This is a great CD. The sound of The Kingsmen is exciting and will give you a good buzz.Now,if it grabbed the attention of Hoover,it certainly should grab the general public once more.I love this album, even "Under my Thumb",he Rolling Stones classic is not a n imitating version, but remarkably different and distinct.Recommend sincerely.
__label__2 Not Free SF Reader: The second book of the Fey is set further into the future of this conflict. The longstanding tradition of changelings in Fey literature is put into play here, as a child is taken, and swapped for a changeling.The upbringing of the boy in his new home will play an important part in the story.
__label__1 You cannot use it in a bathroom.: I had to return it, because it was purchased for use in a bathroom. If you read the lable CAREFULLY AFTER YOU GET IT you will see that this caution is on the box.
__label__1 Also known as Revenge of the Pimple Forehead Woman: The reality is that this movie just wasn't very good. In particular, the action scenes were for the most part a real mess. Case in point the attack on the fort, a clear sign of a director with no clue. The zero g scenes were interesting though. The story itself was a mess and the cinematography was nothing special. The acting was okay, but nothing exciting. The movie was best described as a watse of time (not to mention all the money spend making it). Oh yeah, and the pimple forehead woman was very distracting.
__label__2 Again, the kids are possessed!: "David Collins and Amy Jennings, two charming, innocent children are suddenly turned into demons. At first their pranks only annoy Maggie Evans, their governess. But soon she realizes that they have become malicious, bent on destroying all at Collinwood. Convinced the children are possessed by a mysterious, supernatural power, and frightened for her life, Maggie turns for help to Barnabas Collins. Will his powers be strong enough to become the evil forces that captured the minds of the children before they - and Barnabas - are completely at the mercy of the Devil himself?" (The plot synopsis is taken from the back cover of the first edition paperback. #11 in the series.)
__label__2 Complete coverage yet highly readable: Initially provides a sound introduction to the concepts of networking - the 7-layer OSI model etc . Then describes where WinSock fits in. Builds up to a complete FTP client (complete source included). Then goes through the ENTIRE WinSock 1.1 spec.A very useful chapter on Do's and Don'ts of WinSock.Brief guide to what's new in WinSock 2.0Overall - clear and complete explanations of the whole shebang.
__label__1 Painfully messy: This unit work pretty well, but for the person who ocassionaly makes quesadillas, this unit is a hassle to clean up. If you like to put a lot of cheese or fillings, you can guarantee that the fillings will be spilling out the side.There should have been a side guard or drip pan to collect the overruns, but not so on this unit. Look elsewhere.
__label__2 This is a perfect review book, but it is not a textbook.: If you know English well and you need only to review some important details, this is the book you need to buy. It covers small rules, which are VERY IMPORTANT for the TOEFL, but it does not tell you much, for example, about sequence of tenses.In other words, this book will help you to improve your score, but it can not teach you English if you are a beginner.For me, the most important part of the book was structur review. IT really helped! Listening part shows the same level of difficulty as in the TOEFL, but reading is much easier then on the test. To understand the reading level of difficulty and to practise the test I would recommend TOEFL Test Preparation Kit.
__label__1 Works as well as the expensive stuff!: We've been shelling out hundreds of dollars for ProActiv for our teenaged daughter for the past couple of years, and all of sudden, it stopped working for her. I did a quick "google" and Neutrogena products came up. We gave it try. It took about 5 days to see results - then her face was clear! For the price - you can't beat it!11/27/2011: Actually, it doesn't work as well as Proactiv. My daughters face broke out big time. Never happened before. Might have to see a dermatologist now.
__label__2 Great stuff here, a tribute to JMJ!: Great stuff here. The dvd is pretty bare bones as far as extras.. you only have a static discography and an extremely brief documentary on Profile Records..Anyway, MOST of their video hits are here.. People who remember the DOWN WITH THE KING cd may notice that "Ooh, Whatcha Gonna Do" is not here..Also, "sucker mc's" and "it's like that(remix)" are certainly NEW videos, but technically, don't feature the band..visually, you can't help but notice that hip-hop videos have gotten much better budgets since Run DMC's heyday (witness the head-swapping graphic on "rock box"..), but hey, the music is still as good as it gets...
__label__2 Sting was the Police!: Sting makes his strongest solo effort on this album as he expresses his consistent despair about a world persistent on crushing the individual. Sting returns to consistent Police concerns about dark oppressors bent on erasing the human spirit, but gives them urgency by introducing more autobiographical elements than we've seen from him before. This is a man clearly searching for resolution amidst his personal demons. As with all the best Police material, "Island of Lost Souls" reminds us that we are imprisoned souls, caught in the machinery of this world.
__label__1 Terrible names for the characters!: I got stopped on about 30 pages into the book by the names of the characters. "Butner Fluck"?, "Weed Gardener"?, "Mr. Pretty"?, "Cloud", "Fan", "Fling"?. I love Ms. Cornwall's books, and maybe the plot in this one is good....I can't get that far. The names are too distracting and annoying.
__label__1 Terrible: Fast and dumb action. No reasoning throughout the book, which starts out on a rather lame plot, but worse, the enemy leaves trans, boats and all sorts of other resources for our heros, as they succeed in every effort with just seconds to spare. I like action books, but this one was just horrible.
__label__2 Give It To The Venus Boys!: I was tempted to give this e.p. a few less stars due to the fact I got a speeding ticket while listening to it yesterday, but that would be unfair to Robyn & the boys wouldn't it (it was during "Queen Of Eyes", one of my favorites, I guess I got a little too excited).Anyway, this is a cool companion to "Ole! Tarantula", it contains the title track (same as the album version) and six live songs from the tour with The Venus 3 as his backing band. Amazing sound quality and performances throughout, I'd love to hear a recording of a full set from this tour, as they didn't come to my town (Robyn did, however, come through on a solo tour shortly after this and it was spectacular!)Most surprising are a couple of Soft Boys tunes reworked here, "Queen Of Eyes" and "Give It To The Soft Boys", both awesome versions. If you dig Robyn Hitchcock and his oddball style of psych pop/rock don't hesitate on this one.
__label__2 Stellar experiments in pop.: A near flawless collection. Well written, well performed. Deserves attention on national scale. Puts most stuff on radio to shame. This is what you should be listening to.
__label__2 Real Silk Shorts: I really like the feel and look on my husband. I only wish they held up longer . I get about 9 months of ware from them but there the very best i have found, so it must be the nature of silk.This is my second purchase of them .Try them you'll lkie them. Sharon Oviedo fl.
__label__1 Expensive disposable pool: i would not recommend this pool. we purchased this pool last june for our daughters and while last year they had a great time in it. this year we set up the pool and everything went well until the next morning we woke up and the top ring was completely deflated. called the 800 # and was told the only thing to do is apply soap water and search for leak. well did it and cannot find leak.obviously a slow leak somewhere but so small no way to find it. so yes this pool is easy to set up, but 90 days after you purchase this pool beware no more warranty and your on your own,almost wish we purchased the pool with aluminum walls now ,because with that kind of pool little more work but no worrys about holes and deflating pool walls. and no help from intex the manufactuer.so for the price we paid we got use out of this pool for 1 year.do not buy this product unless you dont care about throwing money away.
__label__2 Great Read!: This book was a pleasure to read! I thoroughly enjoyed attending "Sex Camp" via the written word of Brian McNaught!I strongly encourage you to add it to your summer reading list. After all, you just never know who's eye the title might catch by the pool, at the beach, or on a plane!
__label__1 worst flick of the millenium: It's rare to see a movie with such bad acting, dialogue, plot, and cinematography all in one place. A six year old playing with plastic action figures would be more fun to watch. To give it one star for "I hate it" is being kind.
__label__2 JUST GREAT: I INSTALLED THIS IN MY RV, IT WAS LIGHT WEIGHT, GOOD CONECTORS SO YOU DON'T SEE THE WIRES. THE PICTURE IS GREAT AND I HAVE THE SOUND WIRED TO MY SURROUND SYSTEM. BETTER THEN I HAVE AT HOME.
__label__1 bad discs: would not format in my Philips DVR, despite the fact that the DVR manual listed them as compatible.Went to BestBuy & got Sony +RW & Verbatim +R which work fine, so the problem is not my DVR.
__label__2 Wonderful devotional for dieters: This book is wonderful. It gives you daily support for your diet. I would suggest this for any Christian dieter. It is well worth the money.
__label__2 Very Interesting: I began using this item on my American Stratocaster and it had some interesting results. The sustain was a little bit longer and it faded a lot smoother. The tone overall was changed by adding a certain fullness to the sound. It also makes the guitar feel a lot heavier than just the added weight of the fatfinger.I've experemented with different guitars and it seems like it has significantly more benefits when applied to cheaper guitars, especially medium to low priced strats and strat copies.So results may vary, and a lack of more scientific instructions earn it a 4. By scientific I mean directions telling you where to place it for maximum sustain or to fix particular problems, because placement and tightness of the bolt tend to change things up a bit.
__label__1 Not good: Ihad bought a few books by Kowalke (Standard Catalogs), there are Ok, but this one has no chronological or label order.
__label__2 Very Impressed - Highly Recommended: This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much "bigger" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend! Note: We have the "Burgundy" color one.CFH
__label__1 Not as in-depth as I'd have liked: This book seems as if most parts of it have been directly quoted out of Mary Wilson's "Dreamgirl--My Life as a Supreme". I read Mary's book first, and the parts in the Diana Ross book pertaining to the Supremes, almost all matched Mary's quotes, exactly.I didn't feel like I learned too much, and since this is an "unauthorized" biography, I feel that one cannot tell what is true or untrue. Of course, out of the 3 original Supremes, Diana was my LEAST favorite, so it doesn't upset me to read anything negative. After all, we are all human, and anyone who can't have ANYTHING written about them, cannot be human! At any rate, I was not too satisfied with the information I received from this book in terms of completeness.
__label__1 Long time fan of every trek series... Can't stand this movie: I loved TOS. Saw TNG in my teens ...it formed my values of peace and exploration as an adult, because every character in that series was an outstanding person. Loved DS9 and Voyager both, outstanding. Enterprise: no comment. I don't accept it as part of the ST cannon. The movies, esp II were great.Humpback whales in spaceTransparent Aluminum?No.The only reason I wrote this crappy review was to explain my-clearly contrarian to the Amazonian massses-1 star. Also, I want to say I just don't get you people at all. I think seeing the aggregate rating number of nearly 5 stars, makes me realize why I just don't get along with folks.
__label__2 There's a reason why this toy is a "classic.": I bought these for my 12 mo. old daughter, simply becase I remembered playing with them as a child. They are great. She laughs when I put them on my face (see above review for explanation), she loves to pull the beads apart, and they double as tub toys. What more could you ask for? Oh, and the price is right, too.
__label__1 Junk - Arrived DOA: Bought for Christmas. When opened it won't charge. The instructions tell you to not return the product. Call the Black and Decker 800 number. But after calling, waiting until they are in the office (M - F 8:00 to 5:00, weekdays only - no holidays) and then waiting on hold for half an hour, they tell you to return it. Nothing they can do. It's probably a dead battery.
__label__2 Great For dioramas!: This BMC D-day playset is awsome. It has a good price and it is very durable plastic. It comes with a cool bunker with aa gun. Real looking tank traps and opticals. the landing craft have a perfect scale and is the right color and shape. The detail on the tropps is extremly real with coll poses.The set also comes with 3 12 inch pieces of barbed wire. There are also sandbags to give the tropps cover. This set is perfect for dioramas! You can use the barbed wire for the shingle. If you like the diorama to be super real make the bluffs out of plaster. And paint the water. Great for school projects. You should get this right away!
__label__1 JUNK, JUNK, JUNK....: Bought to replace my Dell DJ stock ear buds. After having these things for 3 months, I'm glad to say that I threw them in the creek during my run today. They never stayed in my ears during a run (trying all three size fittings). And yesterday the left bud started shorting out, it's just over the 90 day warranty, JUNK!!! My stock DJ buds stayed in better. The only good thing is they did sound good if you held them in your ears with both hands!!!
__label__1 Not Good - Copy Protected: I program music for a business and have all the appropriate licensing. I purchased this CD and the only way to play it is using the music player that is on the disc. So this CD is basically worthless to my operation. There is no way to add the songs to my library or playlists. Shame on you, Sony.
__label__2 This Book Never Stops Being Interesting: I have owned two previous editions of "The Book of Rock Lists" and will soon be buying "The New Book of Rock Lists". Why? Because it's fun to read, witty, and incisive! The rock and roll heaven portion, where various deceased rock stars are broken down in terms of how they died, is definitely worth reading.One or two others have already castigated author Dave Marsh for having somewhat of a left leaning bias in his stinging criticism of the PMRC and certain religious zealots, as well as his categorization of famous right wing rockers. I disagree with the reviewer who referred to Marsh as being "PC". However, if you turn your political filter off and you're not thin-skinned, you'll have some fun reading.
__label__2 lots of great pics: This James Dean book is Awesome, it has sooo many great photos to look at I looked at this book for hours! james Dean is the best actor ever!!!!! this book gives all the information and pictures for his whole life's story, its great, you should buy it right away if you want to know and see James Dean!
__label__1 Misto makes the 5-star oil mister!: The norpro is poorly constructed, and won't last long... Misto makes several that get great reviews, and they run $9.99 to $15 each.
__label__2 Delete your dirty laundry: I've had this flash drive for a few years now. I had left it in my pocket & my wife ran it through the washing machine. I was certain that all my files would be deleted. I tried it out & everything works perfect.
__label__2 Hoodman LCD Hood: Hoodman H-D70S Nikon D70 & D70S Flip Up LCD Cap and HoodI have used a Hoodman LCD cap for a number of years on my Nikon D70 and have found the hood useful. This is a replacement for a cap that I accidently broke.
__label__1 Eeeeeh...: It's... alright. I bought this item with hopes that it would be useful to me but it really hasn't. The first time I even touched the car adapter it broke instantly. It's worth it if you want it for the retractable cable and the outlet piece but the outlet adapter is huge. Almost inconvenient. I don't use it often since I got it because I'm sure it will die. But for it's price, I guess it's to be expected.
__label__1 stunk: this movie should have flopped. i expected funnieness in it and i did get some unintentiontal laughs at rose mc gowan. dont watch this its absolutley horrid.
__label__1 The Secret: What a joke!! Rhonda thinks she has "discovered" some great new "Secret". As do the rest of the people in the movie. I guess none of them have ever read the Bible and discovered God's Secret. I have news for all of them....Yes...There will be judgement for your actions.
__label__1 A cult Leader's fictional creation: Before reading this book, learn more about the cult the author has created and what has happened to him in the end. Bottom line: its all about his ego.
__label__2 Good value, acceptable quality: We were looking for an over-sized "Night Before Christmas" book to read to our little ones on Christmas eve. This one does the trick and quality is good for the ~$15 price. Calling it an "heirloom edition" might be stretching it a bit though.
__label__1 DO NOT LOOK UPON THE FACE OF CHAOS UNSPEAKABLE HORROR...: I feel the darkness closing in upon me. I don't know what crossed the threshold, but I know one thing: Uwe Boll is a hack. I feel that my life essence, my IQ was sapped by this movie. Something was taken away from me which I shall never get back. How can the powers of Hollywood allow this blasphemy to continue? How can one man, the sub-mundane and putrid lack of talent named UWE relentlessly assault our senses? I implore you to not subject yourself and your loved ones to this unspeakable wretch of a movie. DO NOT LOOK INTO THIS DARKNESS AND HOPE TO FEEL WHOLE IN THE MORNING! YOG SOGGATH, WE PRAY TO THE END OF DAYS! CTHULU is a brighter spark upon humanity than this fowl tripe of a movie. I want my money back! Go buy some nice music. You have been warned!
__label__1 Beware - copy protected CD: Sadly, this trend has spread to country music. This CD tries to install software on your computer. It will only let you make 'limited copies' that can only be transferred to 'approved devices' and it will only play on your PC using certain programs. All in all, this is very unsatisfactory. The mess Sony got themselves in with their copy protection software should have been a warning to all companies, but apparently it wasn't.Amazon sometimes warns you before purchasing a CD with copy protection; in which case I always pass. However, this time they didn't include a warning.Are Montgomery Gentry great? You bet. And I'm sure they didn't have anything to do with the decision to install this spyware on their fan's computers.
__label__2 Uplifting: This book is loaded with positive thought prods. If you find yourself in the rut of negative thinking, this book is for you.
__label__1 Ugh: Deep Purple NEVER made a bad album until this trainwreck. According to an interview with Joe Lynn Turner:"It's a shame. Some members may got jealous to RB, me and Jim Peatric who were recreating Deep Purple sound."Yeah, these guys recreated Deep Purple to sound like every other generic 80's power ballad band. Thanks alot Joe Lynn Turner, you ruined a perfect career. The only positive part of this album that gives it two starts is some of the playing from Ritchie and Jon.
__label__2 An excellent read.: The first chapter was more of a flashback for myself as I was also one of many who was the focus of fun as a child. I could understand exACTLY the same feeling that young Frank experienced. It was great to see a way out and healing for "The Wounded Spirit". An inspirational and fascinating book to read overnight.
__label__2 LOVE IT !!!: I was soooo excited when I found out Jem was coming on DVD.The box is really cool.The DVD's are amazing.Very very clear.I've been watching them with my daughters (12&9)and they love Jem.Here's for hope season 3&4 comes out !!! :)
__label__1 garbage!: You get nothing that looks like this picture. I wish Amazon had taken it off with the first negative comment. I ended up putting it in the yard so the birds could use it for nesting.
__label__2 love it!: received product in reasonable amount of time. was just as advertised and in great condition. Gabriel is Hilarious. a must have if u love to laugh
__label__1 Why did I buy this book?: I heard the tie rack-butt brush story on TV and Faith Popcorn, someone I particularly enjoy and respect, called it brilliant in a blurb so...As an small business person who is about to open a retail store I was drawn to a title which might help me make design, marketing, advertising and positioning decisions which would replace gut feelings with scientific evidence.Things like how do shoppers respond to color, to floorcoverings, various types of music? What are the best ways of displaying various types of goods? What is the best way to appeal to a variety of socio-economic groups? Buzz words and wants for different VALS profiles. That kind of stuff.What I got instead was the same huge retailer, grocer, bank, fast food and drug store stories repeated over and over again.There was enough good information here to fill a free pamphlet.
__label__1 Not Durable: My dogs had this thing ripped to shreds within minutes. So it may be great for playing catch but don't let your dogs use it as a toy if you are worried about longevity.
__label__1 Out-dated information: I purchased the latest edition of this which was titled, 2001-2002 edition. A more fitting title would be the "1999 Writer's Guide" I write to people who have been gone for two to three years....and their publishing houses are writing nasty letters back to me complaining about my outdated information.This book is shoddy work that is not helping my efforts as a writer. Listing people who have been gone for two-three years and titling the book as current is both unprofessional and unconscionable. It is pretty clear to me that the cover of this book was changed while everything inside stayed the same...a real scam and a disservice to writers.My warning to writers is to check every listing before sending out your query letters or proposals....getting the wrong name on your query letter is a quick way to the trash file.
__label__2 Amazing Colour: The most beautiful colours on these cards. I love using them. They feel lovely and in my opinion activate your psychic ability to tune in.
__label__2 What life was like back then: This movie received an Oscar in 1952 for Best Effects / Special Effects. Well worth it. The story centers on the group of brave men and women who travelled westward for a new life. We all know that story. But what is interesting, and albeit i am sure some liberty was taken, was the conditions in the hold of the ship for these passengers, and the unique use of the printing press. I love the old movies and this one was the first I had seen of it, and for history and genealogy buffs, an interesting film to watch.
__label__2 Excellent. History through Music: I first heard of this through a colleague when visiting the West Point Museum, where he had paired the segment on Fort Sumner and with images of the Fort during the raising of the Flag, the salute through firing blank parrot shells and the playing of the Star Spangeled Banner, in a waltz rythum, as it was played during that ceremony. This is an excellent recording. Bravo.
__label__1 Beware Reading This Book - Major Disappointment: Another reviewer says, "I never felt connected with Dolores or concerned for her. There was nothing entertaining, enlightening,or admirable about her. She had a seriously depressing life and I found her journey not in the least worthwhile." I read this book in 2001 as well, and these were my sentiments exactly. Dolores makes such poor, poor decisions throughout this book. You cannot cheer for her as she becomes her own undoing, despite her poor beginnings. At the end of this book I felt nothing but gyped out of my time and hopeful emotional involvement. In fact, I did not pick up another novel for quite a while - this book was such a disappointment, and I just didn't want to go through that again. Thankfully I have begin reading again and have loved everything from The Kite Runner to A Million Little Pieces to The Reading Group to The Good Earth. I am not a picky reader. This book was just really terrible.
__label__1 Awful: I picked up this book mostly because I'm a Star Trek fan, and I like William Shatner. Usually even when a book is extraordinarily bad, I will finish it, in order to, I suppose, give the author a fair shot. I only forced myself halfway through this one before deciding that it was more pain than it was worth. I couldn't bring myself to care about Mr. Cardigan, the hero, or his sorrows. If Shatner was trying to resurrect the pure testosterone appeal of his lost youth, well, I'm not biting - he should have read Burrough's Martian Tales to see how pure testosterone is done. If he was going for torture and internal conflict, he could not have failed more miserably. If that's what you're looking for, forget Shatner. Try Feintuch's Hope series. That was absolutely unbeatable. After my experience with Tekwar, Shatner doesn't get another chance in my book.
__label__1 Magical Realism with a Dark Bent: If you like stories about long journeys to nowhere, like Tim O'Brien's Going After Cacciato, then this is the book for you. If you like tales of preposterous journeys inside the heads of shell-shocked kids, then this is a great read. If you like to blame it all on the government, this book will make you happy. And if you have the misfortune to be assigned this book in class, imitate the hero and stare at your teacher in dumb silence.
__label__2 Top-quality ambient compilation: With ambient techno going out of fashion faster than Adolf Hitler moustaches at the Nuremberg Trials, record store fetishists are likely to strike gold in the various bargain bins. I picked out this ... thinking it was just the usual compilation which might have one or two tracks to MD. I was wrong. Both discs feature strong compositions from the top dogs of techno including Speedy J, Paul van Dyk and a great Robert Fripp/Orb collaboration called 'Lucky Saddle'. Most tracks are downtempo and ambient flotation though there are some - but not many - trancey moments. But we're talking all-killer-no-filler, and a 190-page booklet with articles and interviews with the artists involved. Warp/Rephlex fans will find enough here to keep them happy for a while. ...
__label__1 Beware which version: Make sure the version you purchase is not the German one, which cannot be downloaded onto your PC. I made that mistake and now have to buy it again.
__label__2 Great Telescope: I've had this telescope for about 6 months now and like many other reviews it's a fantastic piece. Assembly can be a bit tricky with the instructions given, however, it goes togehter in no time. The item shipped and arrived in perfect condition, which is something that I worried about, especially when shipping a telescope.If you want to gaze at the moon, this telescope will allow you to see incredible details. Craters, valleys, etc. The spotter scope on top does a decent job, but is a little inaccurate. Turned the scope to Juipter, and it's true you can see the cloud rings, however it's not that powerful. Saturn is the same way, you can see the rings, but no detail to speak of.Overall this is a great scope, very portable, and easy to use. Great purschase!
__label__2 Great Tape: I used to use this video back in '98 and I lost a truck load of weight. It is a great workout, it kept me sweating and challenged. I used to yell at the screen "ALRIGHT ALREADY" The only thing that I did not like was when she made her turn , boy what a surprise, other than that it is a great full body workout. I recommend this tape to people who are just starting out and really need to work it off.
__label__1 how mean: I thought this was going to be a cute and funny book to give my teen daughter, but I'm so disappointed. It's mean and hurtful and inappropriate because I can't let the younger kids see it. It's definitely overpriced for what I got. I don't even want this in my home.
__label__2 watch: I was very happy to find this watch online. I wanted to replace the one I have with the exact same thing but couldn't find it in any store. The watch is great but needs to be replaced occasionally because of the type of work I do the band tends to get discolored and stretched out after a couple of years.
__label__1 Nice tissues: Uncomfortable, but nice to help the environment, until these tissues went over $0.30 cents a box that is!
__label__1 Doesn't stay on the throat, dog still barks: Maybe this works for some people but my dog just shakes his head until the box is on the side of his neck and then it can't sense his bark. These things should work with a microphone in my opinion. I have put it on really tight and he can still move it. He also has really thick fur so I have to shave his neck so he can feel the shock. It's just been a hassle from the start and the dog still barks. Don't get me wrong it worked at first but now that he knows how to move it to the side... lots of barking. I just got a citronella spray collar and it works much better because it works with a microphone.
__label__1 Angels and Demons was great, this was boring: Angels and Demons was great, but this was boring. I had to force myself to read this, instead of looking forward to the next chapter.
__label__1 "Squeeze Box" was the only good song they ever did: How did these idiots keep going for as long as they did? Their songwriting and arrangements were uninspired. And Daltry had all the vocal expressiveness of an unmusical aarvark. If they were still playing today, they'd belong in Vegas along with Rod Stewart, Tom Jones, and all the other macho hacks.
__label__2 Algae to the Rescue: I just received the book. I haven't read it yet. It came in due time and as advertised. It is a used book from the Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library for which I paid $0.01. Can't beat that deal.
__label__1 Bad Player: I purchased one of these, looking for a player only to keep in my car. I found that it often wouldn't even read a disc, and skipped a lot. I was unable to nordic ski without it skipping on me. It also had a very very short battery life. I may have just received a lemon, but compared to my Sharp portable this one was horrible. It's worth an extra $30-40 for a better player.
__label__2 Hidden treasures: It's interesting that 2 of my 3 favorite reads of late are novels way off the beaten path. PREY by Michael Crichton is a number 1 best seller written by a renowned author, and CLONED LOVE by Thorne Peters are written by unknown authors, yet all three are first rate novels. I enjoyed all three very much. In this novel we visit current technology and get a look at the machinations of the software world, which we are engulfed by these days. And, like in CLONED LOVE, it manages to add romance to the story. PREY is predominately about the nano tech with humans seasoned in and CLONED LOVE is about lovers with the story of their technologically engineered heritage seasoned in. In that sense, all three of these novels together weave a sort of trilogy-like tapestry that enlightens, entertains and enriches.
__label__2 Excellent bible to prestigous watches: Great pictures and details of watch movements and materials, usually with prices. A must for any collector or even someone looking for that one of a kind piece that may suit their needs. Only drawbacks - Some of the newer, what I consider high end brands are not included and the extra leaflet that comes with it shows no prices. More or less useless (leaflet only) unless you are rich and don't care about cost. I don't credit any of these problems to the publisher/author. The industry is fast paced and I am impressed they have as much info as they have. I Call it "My bible towatches" (with minor exceptions
__label__2 The Source: Full of history definitive terms, classical techniques, this book is a must own for any student of the culinary arts. Lierally a dictionary of terms with helpful photographs and period drawings.
__label__2 8-Mile, ~rocks baby!~: Okay, heres all my shiz..even tho 8 mile aint out yet i was able to see a secret sneak peak at it by winning tickets (??aint telling how??). But anywho..Eminem is the best in this movie! I def. think ya'll should go see it. OK, now for the soundtrack, I love all of it..a few songs aint my fave but thats ok. Yes 4 stars is what i rate it!
__label__2 Nikon 58mm Lens Cover: What do you say, it's a plastic lens cover. Wish it was cheaper, but Nikon is over priced, so what do you want? It fits the 58mm size as a stock cover would, but also feels a little cheap, like a stock would. It does the job, I bought it, and would again if need be.
__label__2 Brilliant!: This wonderful book is a must read for all serious students of history. While it is admittedly beyond most undergraduates, it should be required for all aspiring professional academics in the humanities and social sciences.
__label__2 VERY GOOD: THIS IS A GOOD BOOK KEITH WAS A DIRTY DOG. THE ONLY TWO THINGS THAT I DID NOT LIKE IS: TUKEY FELT BAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPEN W/ HER FRIEND, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEIR IN A RELATIONSHIP. 2. KEVIN GIRLFRIEND WAS NOT WELL DEVELOP ENOUGH AND EVEN AFTER HE DIES SHE WAS NOT MENTION AGAIN.ALL IN ALL THIS IS A HOT BOOK. THE SEX SCENES ARE ALL THAT AND A BAG OF CHIPS. I READ THIS BOOK IN 2 DAYS I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.THIS BOOK HAS EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.(EXAMPLES:SEX AND DRAMA.....)
__label__2 Celtic Woman Review: I really enjoy this CD for three reasons. One, it is exactly the music I so much loved hearing on KCTV one evening, which is where I first heard about Celtic Woman. Second, the harmony and voices are so skilled, clear and generally joyous. Third, the instruments played are many, and give me a real sense of being there with everyone while they created the music. Thank you!
__label__1 Bad from title to end: The only thing mysterious here is how this great scientist has managed to muddle up his own theory in this book to the point where its unintelligible. It takes him a chapter to state that the electron does not have a velocity or a path in the classical sense. And why give this book such a blatant appealing title to lure beginners to pay money for this trash. No examples or end-of-chapter problems either. Read Lev Landau instead.
__label__2 The Darkness that Comes Before Review: I purchased this based on a suggestion from an anonymous blog. It took a while for me to get into it. The first half of the book didn't seem to make sense and was boring me (it may have related to the fact that it was based on snippets I read while on the train). Even now (I'm on the second book) I find some of the names needlessly complex and distracting. However around half way through I really started to enjoy this. The characters really sucked me in to the story line. It reminded me a bit of Kentaro Miura's Berserk.
__label__2 Great value for the price!: purchased this item for whole house audio with 5 pairs of speakers to be hooked up. the impedance protection is great for multiple pairs as it prevents the amp from overheating.Pros: works exactly as statesCons: plastic button feel cheap, they work though!
__label__1 Taming Of The Shrew: I found this story to be extremely elementary. This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future.
__label__1 Pshhh.... not what I expected: Xbox's are not to good at all. Theres a few cool games so what? Ps2 is much better! So just get a Ps2.. Hey it doesn't cost 70 dollers for the net play thing!So....PS2 is better
__label__2 Best Diapers available!!: I have four children and this is the only diapers that did not leak or cause my child to break out in a rash. I believe it is best for the skin if you can do cloth but if you are using diapers this is the one to pick! I only buy pampers baby dry (the other pampers cause my babies to have rashes). These diapers will hold all the pee and runny poo=) The price on subsribe and save is great and with no tax or shipping how could you go wrong?!
__label__1 It seems to leak.: I bought this on sale at Big Five. Used it once in the Trinity R. at a kayak launch with strong current out in the middle, and rapids below with no place to get out for a few miles. But I just went out from one small launch area to another and paddled back under the brush. It touched brush and although it was not stuck, it also seemed to leak from thed time I "put in". The valve lets air out if you squeeze it. I could not see any bubbles coming out from the one I could check in the water. Had a great time, but it started deflating by itself on the way back. It is now over half deflated. I paid $10 for it. I never used one before and there were NO real instructions. Just said to blow it up, period. We did not know, and blew it up with a bicycle pump. It took forever. I think a gas station pump might work, but, not sure. I'm returning it. I wish I knew why it leaked.
__label__2 Great ChemE Book: I really like how they focused on Hysys which is what is mostly used in industry. This is a great book for undergrads and grad taking designs in chemical engineering.
__label__1 The last fad diet I fall for: Day four on the diet. Feeling listless, nauseous, weak, cranky. My head hurts. If I look at another egg or head of lettuce, I'm gonna vomit. I've had enough. Sorry, Dr. Agatston.
__label__1 Not bad. Wildly overpriced.: In itself this book teaches how to make cheese, however for the price you don't get much meat. The quality of the print is pathetic. With 2-3 more dollars you can buy Carroll's or Ciletti's book. I mean, it's like paying the same price for an old wreck or a brand new upper level car ...
__label__1 Not good if you still eat meat.: Amy, I served chicken noodle soup. I knew chicken noodle soup. Chicken noodle soup was a friend of mine. Amy, you're no chicken noodle soup.If you haven't had meat in awhile, I suspect this would satisfy your chicken noodle soup craving. But if you've had real, homemade chicken noodle soup (or heck, even something else from a can) in the past year, this soup is probably not for you. The faux chicken's texture is not bad, but it tastes like onion-y cardboard. The noodles are fine, but the overall taste is salty and onion-y, and not at all chicken-noodle-soup-y.If this soup dropped the faux chicken and called itself "onion noodle soup", I'd probably give it 2 stars. However, as a "chicken noodle soup", it's just not very good (unless you love onions, salt and/or haven't had chicken in awhile).
__label__1 NEGITIVE TEN: I don't know how such a dull, boring book could get published. Don't waste your money or time. This was my first N.Barr and it will be my last. If you want good murder mysterys read any of James Lee Burke!
__label__1 please release night rider album!: actually i think this album is mediocre and i am writing this only to plead for whoever is in charge to release tim's outstanding night rider album on cd.
__label__2 What an incredible movie!: This movie is truly amazing!! It is a wonderful love story that also deals with many real-life issues. Maggie, one of the characters is struggling to keep her sexuality a secret from her mother, while at the same time trying to keep the relationship with her girlfriend... This film has a healthy dose of comedy, drama, and a reasonable amount of sexiness. This movie has it all, and I would recommend buying this to everyone; as it truly is a gem.
__label__1 Trite, Boring, Painful: As an avid reader of westerns, I picked up this book because it was by a local author, and I thought it would be interesting to experience the west through a new type of hero that has not been explored much, the African American cowboy. But this book was painfully trite and boring. The main character is nothing more than a caricature, and completely full of himself. Not wanting to judge too quickly, I read another book by the same author following the same caricuture, er character.The author can't even keep his own characters straight. In a previous book the main character Jay, was half African American, half Apache. In this book, he's half white and half African American. Please don't waste your time on this book, stick to the classic westerns like the Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy.
__label__1 GRAND PRIX 3 = WORST PEICE OF CRUD EVER: GP3 is HORRIBLE.Bad graphics,bad sound,bad idea to buy it.GP3 is so bad it made me miss Night Driver for Atari 2600.Back to Grand Prix Legends for me,if only I could go ten laps without my engine blowing up!
__label__1 This is not an inkjet transparancy: I had done a search for inkjet transparencies and mistakenly thought that was what I was ordering. These are a bit thin and I don't see the stripe they talk about, but they might work for some purposes. They're just useless to me because they aren't coated for inkjet printers and the ink will never dry.
__label__1 Not sure what the other reviewers are talking about...: but this book was SO predictable that it was downright silly after a while. The only reason I didn't request a refund is the waiting period has passed. This author is going on my 'Never Again' list!
__label__1 it was ok: it was ok ...maybe a little too slow for my taste but it was an ok book. i would borrow rather than purchase
__label__1 terrible: Don't waste your money. Senseless daily routine from the perspective of some nut.Girls uninteresting and unsexy. embarrassed to have purchased it.
__label__2 Fantastic Indie Music: This CD is hands down one of my favorites that I own. Well done, feel good indie rock.
__label__2 Great CD: Great CD, good value for the price. Nice to hear Dave a little different than w/the full band.
__label__1 I thought the book was an O.K. book.: I thought that the book Tuck Triumphant was an O.K. book. It wasn't that bad. It wasn't a book I would like to read again. It was a good book at some parts. Some parts it wasn't so good. Some parts I think are strange like when Helen's family already has lots of kids, a blind dog and another dog. They adopted another kid from another country. Another thing is they have to be careful because they have a blind dog and a deaf child.
__label__1 Cliche and useless: This book is heavily based on stereotypes of older women and younger men. There isn't any useful information here for women or men. Nothing in the book is new, interesting, or fun.
__label__2 Nice selection of condoms....: Worth the money...very nice selection! The package contained vibrating cock rings as well as flavored condoms for your tasting pleasure!
__label__1 OVERPRICED: I bought one of these units several years ago and sent it back. It sounded pretty good but my $120 boombox ( I think it was a Magnavox ) sounded just about as good as this. I was really disappointed after all the hype in the Bose AD. I had a couple of friends listen to it before I sent it back just to make sure I was giving it a fair chance. Like me they thought it sounded slightly better than my old boom box but not worth the $1,064 I paid at that time. That was several years ago so maybe they have improved ( but so have the $120 systems ) I would say go listen to one of these in person before you spend this kind of money. I think the Wave radio sounds good as well but it should be about $100 to $150 not $500!
__label__1 Very little useful information: This is a collection of quoted writings by Lenin and his contemporaries. The author does give a paragraph summary here and there, but this is not useful for study of the Soviet Union. I want my 30 bucks back.
__label__1 The worst book I Have ever read on this subject: Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would have understand some of his descriptions about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santos
__label__2 Classic Funk: One Of Midnight Star's Best. Happy That This one Made It To CD. Takes Me Back To My Days In The US Army. Lots Of Great Music During Those Days.
__label__2 love it: after reading the first in this series I couldn't wait to get into this one. the character development is great and the culture lessons are invaluable
__label__1 Beware, it installs spyware: Intuit, in its (rightful) decision to protect its product from casual copying made a very very wrong decision by installing a service called C-Dilla on the user's machine. This service, which runs all the time and won't uninstall even after you've uninstalled Turbotax is often considered as "spyware" by various source on the internet. It installed without the user's permission, and is not even refered to in the license agreement.I would strongly suggest staying away from Turbotax products this year. Hopefully Intuit will have learned its lessons next year and removed this.
__label__2 Adorably Hilarious: We were at Hollywood Video one Friday night when my sister told me lets take this I wasnt thrilled about her choice buit what the heck, Anyway when I got home my sister played this movie in the DVd and It was one of the funniest movies ever, Kate Hudson is adorable and surprisingly hilarious anyone will enjoy this film even if romantic comedies arent your type
__label__1 Not worth it: I bought this book for my husband thinking it would be great giving him his own book instead of reading all the ones geared toward women. Whoops was I wrong.Although humerous this book had no information he nor I was looking for.If you want some chuckles out of an easy read this book is for you, otherwise not worth wasting your time. You'll never get that hour back!
__label__2 Real life, only funnier and way more dangerous: I love everything about this book. I love that it's pink and it fits in my purse, sure, but most of all I love the story Danielle tells and the way she tells it: with frankness, honesty, and humor. She delivers the lasting impression that this book is a love letter she wrote to honor a memorable part of her life, so it's not only a well-written story but the reader feels like there's a purpose there, too. It's a good feeling.
__label__1 amateurish writing: This book suffers from writing that fails to hold the reader's interest. The plot is far fetched and difficult to believe. It was one of the most difficult kindle books I've ever tried to bore through. I'd look elsewhere for a good read.
__label__2 Fun to read: I found that if I put aside all of my preconceived notions of vampires, movies, etc from pop culture, and took this book on its own terms, it was great. The ending is a bit hurried compared to the set up, though, but otherwise a nice read.
__label__1 Had 2 wks. and it now won't work: Well I hate to be the one to leave a bad review, but I must. My husband and I bought this fridge and received it 2 wks. ago. Yesterday, my husband noticed that it was not making any noise and realized that the insides of the fridge were no longer cool. The compressor was so hot that it could not be touched. We unplugged it and let it cool down and thought that it would maybe come back to life. No such luck! It's dead.I have requested to send it back but I no longer can find the packaging slip so that I have the address to send it back to. We will see how returning it goes, but for that kind of $$. I just hope that they take it back and give me a refund.
__label__2 Philosophy is the greatest!: I just love philosophy. My skin is so much better. My friends think I have done something to my skin, and I tell them it's because of philosophy skin care. I ran out one time, and used another product. I could really tell the difference in my wrinkles... so I am back to stay on my philosophy regime.
__label__2 Burn Baby Burn!: I am going to order some more of these fire starters. Pretty cheap and work pretty good.The box on Amazon looks larger than what you get in real life. I thought, "What?" But have decided the product works pretty good.Will order again.
__label__1 not powerful enough and sloppy to use: the pulse is too weak and its sloppy to use as it drips volumes of water. tank could be larger as well
__label__2 TKO: I really like the game, but I wish the opponent's attacks were just a little more telegraphed so that I, as a player, would have a better fighting chance against the computer that is obviously connected to whatever button I press when it comes to its defensive tactics.
__label__2 Easy to install/great sound quality: Purchased this additional handset to add to the 3-phone Panaonic system we purchased a few months ago. This handset was very easy to connect to the existing system: just plug it in and press the locator button on the base phone--done! We upgraded to this system when our old phone began interfering with our wireless router, causing us to get bumped offline a lot. This phone doesn't interfere with our wireless router or other appliances and has very clear sound quality. I love the big buttons and intuitive menus. Like that you can use it as an intercom, too. My only complaints would be that the display is hard to read with my less-than-perfect vision and the buttons are not lit, so finding the right one in the dark can be tricky.
__label__1 Defect: Within 2 weeks of normal use the ( prime ) word has come on and the machine will not pump water, the reliablity of this is poor, I'm considering only buying local so that I can return items without the shipping bother, the few bucks you save online sometimes isn't worth the bother, I followed manufactures trouble shooting and the reset of the prime did not work
__label__2 Excellent product: A great stand. It is sturdy and also well made. I added a goosneck to it for my needs and the two product worked perfectly together, I am very happy with it.
__label__1 The color is more of a lime-green and not sage: I bought this set with a recommendation from a friend about the softness and quality. I will return this set as the color is not at all sage, it's more like lime-green that doesn't go with my decor.
__label__2 Review: I am very impressed with the book "MoneyBall" I have seen the movie but like most times the book is better than the movie. You will especially enjoy this book if you are in to baseball.
__label__1 Poor quality: Made sloppily. Does not hang straight. If you are going to manufacture 1000's of these, you could at least do it right. This is not rocket science.
__label__2 Good Book - Great Course: I am from the University and I met Tom Patire after his talk. I wanted to buy a book but he was sold out so I ordered it from Amazon. I read the book and found it to be very easy to read and understand, and found the information inside to have tremendous value.After reading the book I enrolled in Training for Life course with my sister. The course was just like the book said. It was easy to learn, very effective and best of all taught avoidance at all costs.The world is very unpredictable and safety should, but isn't always, in the forefront. I agree with many of Patire's principles but the one thing I thing we are all in agreement is "Safety in our own hands!"I encourage all to read the book and then taking the course, if you have an interest in going to the next level of personal safety.Peace!
__label__2 A compassionate biography well written: Charles Slack takes a refreshing look at a significant American financier. If not the target of a collective smeer campaign by her competitors (and a complicit media looking for another heady Hetty story), Hetty Green has at the very least not received her due as an American financial titan--until now. Slack ably makes the case that Green knew her stuff and stuck to her guns. No smoke and mirrors here and no apologies. Just a woman--granted sometimes fascinatingly eccentric--who knew how to create wealth and took great pleasure in doing it. Slack writes elegantly.
__label__2 Charming: This is the first book by Art Linkletter that I've ever read. It won't be the last. The "Kids" are the stars, of course. The stories are charming and such a pleasure to read. I didn't want to put the book down.
__label__1 Save your money: I was fairly disappointed with this book, I was hoping for it to concentrate more on the photography aspect rather than photo-editing techniques. It feels more like a Photoshop book with a 32 page introduction to digital cameras written for a graphic designer, not a photographer.
__label__1 Disgrace!!!: Having to pay for $20 per 2 TV Episodes is what I call disgrace! DVD was invented for better not for worse! Act accordingly and don't buy these DVD's unless they become available in a much more reasonable price. Please note that I have not seen any episode of Farscape and although i was planning to buy the Series on DVD to try it out, I won't cause I don't like being fooled! Same thing they do and on Star Trek TOS. You 've got to buy 40 DVD's priced 15-17$ each! This will not stand!
__label__1 did not work for me: This signal booster did not work for me. I set it up according to the instructions, connected to a Dlink Router DI-624.When I attempted to connect to the router via laptop, it would connect and then drop the connection after about 10 seconds. That would repeat indefinitely.I tracked the signal with a strength meter, and it boosted it to the level expected, but for some reason when the connection was made to the router, it was dropped.I sent the first unit into Hawking thinking it was defective, but they replaced the unit, and it did exactly the same thing.I have no idea why it didn't work. Maybe my fault.I am thinking perhaps I need two of these, one at the router, and one at the laptop. Perhaps the signal going back to the router is not strong enough to keep the connection.
__label__2 Funny and highly recommended.: This is a book that people who hate poetry will love. Hirschberg's Haiku covers a variety of modern topics, usually with a funny or sarcastic twist. I laughed until tears rolled down my face. You will not put this book down until you have finished it!
__label__2 It was a prank: I got a subscription for my little brother, who is just starting his sophomore year at college. He has been watching a lot of cat videos on youtube and made a facebook page for the family cat so it seemed the apropos thing to do. Anyway, it was a funny surprise awaiting he and his roommates at their very manly college house.
__label__1 ok for $1.: The book was entertaining enough considering the bargain price. Seems like the author could not decide which heroic plot to focus on so he tried to cover them all and did not do any of them justice. Plot is far fetched at times.Descriptions of the scenery is lacking and the historical perspective is dull when it should not have been.
__label__2 My dog loves this stuff: I got the peanut butter flavor, and my dog will let me brush her chompers as much as I want. The only issue I've had is that the bristles can get a little bent out of shape when stored in a bag, but overall, this product is pretty great. The different sized brushes make it so that no matter your dog's size, one of them will work.
__label__2 Approval Addiction: Perfect for those who experience what the title describes. Clearly Ms. Meyer loves the Lord as she weaves scripture throughout. Definitely biblically based.
__label__1 Bad Movie that could have been good!: If there was ever a movie that needed a lil TNA, this would be it. It had all the makings of a decent flick, but needed the random TNA. Im sorry, but this was not a good enough movie to warrent not having it.
__label__1 Makes a loud, annoying tone when used with a cordless phone: I bought my TeleZapper for use with a new Motorola 2.4 GHz Digital cordless phone. Whenever I press the "ON" or the "HANDS-FREE" buttons on the handset, the phone emits a loud and annoying beep. This makes it very difficult to hold the handset close to you ear when you make or take a phone call. When I disconnect the TeleZapper, this loud tone is not present.Anyone else have this problem?
__label__2 Nightmariffic: My wife would leave me for jack skeleton if she had the chance! Lucky for me he is just a fictional character and is not real. Sorry to disapoint.
__label__2 My son's favorite: My son is a bit of a picky eater, and I had tried so many brands of milk and this one he loved so much and as an added bonus is organic. Even my husband likes it, he said it tastes like milkshake.
__label__2 A must have for everyone in a relationship: This is by far the best book I have ever read about relationships.And it has the most incredible solid advice for how to make a relationship work. I cannot recommend this book more highly.
__label__1 I hate it,: I happen to be a huge Disney fan but no one can deny the studio was at its all-time low (their only low, actually) during the 70's and most of the 80's. Of all the animated Disney features of that era, The Fox and the Hound is the only one worth mentioning. However, the worst one must be "Oliver & Company" (equaled with The Aristocats). Poor quality animation, substandard songs and a weak plot make this among the worst Disney movies ever made. One cannot believe this is the same studio that only a year later brought the masterful The Little Mermaid with its stunningly detailed animation, lush colors and appealing music.
__label__2 This is a great CD!: There aren't many debut albums that stand the test of time some 35 years after they were first released. But "Garland Jeffreys" is another timeless classic from the great New Yorker and singer-songwriter. "Lon Chaney" is a standout and was recently covered by Vetiver. Garland Jeffreys also has a YouTube video for the song.In short, buy this album - you'll love it!
__label__1 East-West Live [Live]: I'm a huge Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield fan and have most of their stuff. The concept of this album is very interesting and I bought it on spec even though I knew the sound quality would be less then steller. That said, I can not describe how disappointing the sound quality is here. This literally sounds like someone hung a mike outside the window of the building next door to the club where the band was playing. Please. This record has no business being for sale anywhere.
__label__2 Very informative, especialy like the parts on Philosophy.: Has some good and Useful information. I highly recomend this boo
__label__1 FAKE: I became something else as I payed for.The item is called "Canon Tripod Mount Ring A(W)" in amazon, but acctually the name written on the ring is "for Canon Tripod Mount Ring A(W)" it also does not look like the ring on photo. I knew that original canon ring costs more money, but I thought it is a rabate or old model. But I became a fake. I'm not angry that I have a fake,because it was really cheap, but I'm angry that amazon sold me a fake as original.
__label__2 bike parts: We bought this along with the other parts for my husband's car. Great shipping speed and great price compared to local shops.
__label__1 Croatian Holocaust Revisionism: A shocking book based on little academic historical research, but rather manufactured revisionist history. Croatia, which was likely Hitler's greatest Nazi ally and conducted a brutal Holocaust against its Jewish and Serb minorities a mere fifty years ago, is according to McAdam one of the West's greatest allies and victims. McAdam's next "work" will likely be on how Nazi German death camps were actually work and rehabilitation centers for Jews!A shoddy work of little historical substance.A review of the Holocaust and Croatia's horrid role can be found in any library and will provide a reader with a very different perspective.
__label__1 Piece of junk...: I purchased this unit two months ago on the basis of good prior reviews. As of today it is non-functional and is useful only as a slim, trim paperweight. It will simply not play without breaking up even after following suggested correctives in the manual. I believe the DVD tray is not lining up correctly, but it's simply not worth investing any $ for repairs. I suggest spending a little more upfront and purchasing a simple unit that works.
__label__2 Important historical effort: Knowledge of history is one of the best sources of wisdom there are. Dr. Leon Portilla, a serious anthropologist and historian, recovers here many sources of the history of the ancient inhabitants of what is now Central Mexico. Certainly advanced cultures in some respects (very backwards in some other), but doomed to fall prey to the Conquerors, mainly due to two reasons: the Spaniard's more advanced technology, and the internal dissensions of the Indian cultures. This book is very important because it allows us to understand better the societies that existed before the Conquest. Leon Portilla includes original texts and interpretations of the poems, the philosophy and the cosmovision of the Nahua world. Rigorous and extremelly well-researched.
__label__1 Just don't fit right: These bags are just not the size and shape they should be. The collar is OK and I was able to finagle the bag in place and use it and therefore won't bother to return. I've had better luck with generic bags (just wish I could remember where I got them). I won't buy these again.
__label__2 This is an American Band? Wow!: Raleigh, NC Daylight Dies has surprised me to no end with this album. I thought dark, melodic, depressing and genuinely moving masterpieces come out only out of Sweden, Finland or England. Very heavy doom/death (?), never mind the labels, also very melodic, very original heartfelt melodies at that. This stuff is capable of seriously depressing the listener, but also has this beautiful, love/compassion/sadness mix of angelic quality to it, only opeth, katatonia, dark tranquillity or (also American) novembers doom invoke in me. Beautiful, beautiful, deeply moving stuff. But for all its beauty, it also offers a serious amount of aggressive metal. In a word: flawless cd not just for metal fans.
__label__1 A bit creepy and pagan: "The fox went out on a chilly night, and he prayed to the moon to give him light." Thus begins this illustrated version of the old song, complete with the fox bowing his head in supplication to the moon (Artemis/Diana?). While the artwork is interesting, I would not call it beautiful or captivating. The moral of the story is that the moon must answer prayer, since the fox gets a goose and a duck, escapes the pursuing farmer, and enjoys the fowl meal with his canine companions in their underground home that is furnished with tables, chairs, a fireplace, etc.When looking for a children's book, I prefer something more wholesome with cheerful, uplifting and warm art and message. This one leaves us cold.
__label__1 Useless is an understatement: This book is pure nonsense.For a start it is worded very badly.pg 30 :::"When you get the kind of online connection that allows you to see pretty pictures on the Web, you are using TCP/IP"Come on please! At least explain that it is HTTP.Thats the writing of a "computer security expert"?? I don't think so.If you want to learn about hacking go and get the Hacking exposed books. I am not saying that they are amazing but I certainly learnt more from them in the first chapters then in all of Happy Hacker.
__label__1 Wow terrible pen: This would be a great pen if the ink didn't constantly skip every other letter. Even pressing down hard doesn't fix the problem. I hope I can get my money back.
__label__1 I HAVE A CHEAP WAY TO DO THIS: I CANNOT BELIEVE PEOPLE BUY SUCH A GADGET! I ALSO HAVE THE ADVENT BOTTLES AND MANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS...SO FAR SO GOOD. I HAVE NO COMPLAINS. WHEN MY BABY WANTS HER BOTTLE, I STICK A WATER FILLED MICROWABLE BOWL(NARROW AND A LITTLE TALL)IN THE MICRO ON HIGH FOR A MINUTE.I REMOVE MY BOWL, NOW WITH BOILING WATER AND PLACE BABY BOTTLE. I HAVE THIS DOWN TO A SCIENCE. I WAIT 2 MINUTES AND WE ARE DONE.THIS ITEM DOES JUST THAT, WHY SPEND SPACE ON COUNTER TO HOUSE THIS UNIT?????
__label__1 Too sensitive & not robust: I am not satisfied with this phone. Like the person below, I had to create a fake number (called AAVoicemail) as just about every time I pressed the contacts button, the phone called the first person on my contact list.If you buy this phone, do not drop it even once as it does not take a beating. I dropped it once and now the call button rarely works.I never hooked up the music. When I tried, I found that the earphone/AC plug was bent. I took the phone to a service center and they said I would have to pay a $50 restocking fee to exchange it. I fixed it myself. Now it works, but I have to be careful when plugging in the earphone/AC extension.I don't use an earphone or bluetooth. I rarely use the camera. The phone is good if you want to be trendy, but it was not built to last.
__label__1 karate teacher: It was a pretty hard read. it was easy to put down .only a couple of really good letters if you like books like this I think I would choose another one beside this book.
__label__1 Where's the rest of the world?: This book focuses almost completely on European styles, with an exception for ancient Egypt. I was really hoping to use this for some 15th-century Incan / Mesoamerican reference, but this book doesn't even include anything close.
__label__1 Not as good as 2008 adaption: Other than Emma Thompson being way too old to act as a nineteen year old Elinor, Hugh Grant(Edward) looking absolutley stiff as board, Alan Rickman(Col. Brandon) looking as if he was sleep-walking throughout the movie, and Kate Winslet completely overacting Marianne, I suppose this movie is okay. If you haven't seen any other version this might seem great; but after seeing the BBC adaption, this doesn't even compare... Don't waste your money- get the 2008 BBC version.
__label__2 Keep It In Your Pants (Pocket): This latest installment of Erotic New York is large enough to include the exciting skinny on all the sexy places you've always heard about but never gotten up the nerve to check out; and small enough to stick in your back pocket. I like to keep in close by when I go out. My friends and I have been referring to it mid-evening, closing our eyes and randomly selecting our next venue...a fun game when you employ the "no turning back" rule!This book is fun to read and dare I say educational.
__label__2 Picture dosent show: this is great price looks good on my girl friend and is fine just the picture doesn't show that the pink lace is just printed on the fabric. Again this was fine for us but don't be disappointed when you get it and things aren't as they appear.
__label__1 Doesn't work: I bought this program despite the bad reviews and ended up returning it. The software would not record because it said the VHS tapes were copywrited, but yet they were old family events! The advanced mode didn't work for me at all, I kept getting an error message.The one guy that gave this a positive review is from Austin, TX, strangely where this company is based. Also, the only other product he reviewed was also made by this company....hmmmm. SAVE YOUR MONEY!
__label__1 A Waste: Didn't last more than 10 mins. with my 1yr old female pitbull, Bella.Very colorful but very flimsy also. A waste of money.
__label__2 Shuffleboard: This item is good quality and fun for the entire family. We have all played it and enjoyed it.
__label__2 Pretty Good: This usually isn't my kind of reading... but shame on me because I really enjoyed it. Now I know what I've been missing. This story was complex and gritty. Liked it a lot. I'm going to pick up the whole series.
__label__2 I love this movie, but...: This DVD is the Edited version... cut from 97 to 85 minutes to get the R rating... Go for the VHS unrated version until Vidmark wises up and puts out the unrated version on DVD...Still Jackson is a genius as I'm sure you'll see even in this somewhat diminished version.
__label__2 A little overrated, but still a wonderful, touching book: Before you bash me for not giving this book 5 stars, please listen to me first.I truly loved this book. Bryce's family and the suffering that his son, Damon, went through nearly broke my heart and it was vividly written with plenty of emotion.On the downside, the book was at least 30 pages too long. There were unnessecary parts, such as going on about the lighthouse light in the apartmenmt window and Damon's junk-bucket car that really got to me because they were repeated and dragged out too much for my liking. Also, the graphic descriptions of Damon's injuries and infections are not really something good to read with you lunch.Also, I found the book to be a little bit overrated.I don't consider it a masterpiece like "The Power of One" but it's definitely not a cold fish like Courtenay's "The Potato Factory," which bored me to tears. I'd rate it at about a 7.5/10 or 8/10, putting it in the same league as "Tandia."
__label__1 SLOW & BORING!: I can't believe they say this game is for 5-10 yearolds! It is SO SLOW! You spend alot of time going backand forth, there is ALOT of repetition. The charactersmove slowly and you have to keep going back and forthto different spots to find different things you needto get the treasure. It is no where near as fun orentertaining as Pajama Sam, I can't believe the samepeople made this game. Huge disappointment!
__label__2 I loved these...classic: I am 35 years old and I played with these when I was little and I loved them! I didn't even know that you could still get them and I plan on getting them for my kids this Christmas. :)
__label__1 A good ole fashioned witch hunt: This book is a pure witch hunt based on information that was illegally obtained. The authors are currently being sued for trying to make money by using information that was illegally obtained. On top of that there is nothing in this book that everyone didnt already know. The authors are just trying to cash in on Barry Bonds like everyone else. However, all the Bonds haters will give this book 5 stars just because they hate Bonds.
__label__1 btlfan: I enjoyed the first Ruttle DVD so much that I preordered Ruttles 2 and had it delivered on March 1st. I must confess that I was very happy with the outcome. Eric was trying to be too funny and overdoing soooooo many Python like things that just were not happening, at least for me. It was just like the first with a bunch of cameos that were OK. Even Robin Williams was flat.Sorry, thats what I think.
__label__1 It broke: It broke not to long ago. The spring fell out and I couldn't find it to put it back in. I will spend a little more money and get a better one next time.
__label__1 Falls Over: This table should have been made by Little Tykes. It falls over if not put standing against a wall. It still tipes a little. It could also say more than what it does, be a little more interactive.
__label__2 great packaging great product: I brought this item to put in a care package for a friend, who is deployed and like everyone else, is a head shaver. He likes the product a lot. I like the product because it's not in an aerosol can, which means I can send it in the mail.
__label__2 Goldrush, a super movie: had already seen if , had it on vhs, loved it , I'd recommend it to anyone. A very good movie va
__label__2 Amazing Album: Breaking Benjamin return with their third album "Phobia" and i must say it is their best yet. There are very few rock albums these days that can compare to this. Ben is an amazing vocalist who is also a very talented songwriter. There is no filler on this album, all top quality breaking benjamin tunes! GO BUY THIS CD IMMEDIATELY! you won't be disappointed!
__label__2 Not your typical zombie/mutant film: First off, be advised this is a foreign film. It's in French with English subtitles.This is one of my favorites. I have watched it many times and thoroughly enjoy it every time.Special effects and cinematography are well done in this film. Pretty basic without all the Hollywood CGI, but very good and believable. The acting was fine and I think the characters were presented and developed well.The story is partly about the woman and her partner struggling to survive and partly about their love for each other. Even after he is infected and starts to mutate, she stays with him and tries to cope, hoping to find a way to help him. If you want a good drama with a zombie/mutant back story, you will likely enjoy this. If you want blood, gore, explosions, fighting, etcetera, you will want to pass.
__label__2 yoga SLOW burn: it definatly burns, but it is sloooooooow.this dvd is all about slow and controled movements held for a long time.I personaly dont have the self-discipline to do this kind of yoga at home, alone.
__label__2 Everything you need to know about CAD: is in this book. Good learning tool for those just starting CAD or need quick catching up. So much reference I used it for ACAD 14 as well.
__label__1 Black - MADE INCORRECTLY!!!: I've ordered the black bag, then exchanged it for a second bag since the first was defective. The second bag was also defective. The draw string is stitched into the tube, making it impossible to cinch the bag closed. So sad! This is an extremely well made bag!!!! If only the draw string was not sewed down (you can tell this was an error)!It appears all of amazon.com's stock of this bag (in black) is affected.REALLY wanted this bag. Bummed!
__label__1 A Complete Dud: The sound this makes is not interesting, fun or pleasing at all - don't waste your money
__label__1 Doesn't work on DS "lite" systems: Can't really rate as it's not a game it's a charger!I like the Docking Station and how it's set up with the adapter. Unfortunately, when I ordered it I didn't realize that my children's DS lite would not fit in the adapter. I assumed it fit all Nintendo DS systems.If you have the older DS system then it would be great to have it set up in your child's room so that they charge their game each night.
__label__1 Disappointed "under pressure": Based upon my research and a good friend's recommendation I purchased my first electric Pressure Cooker, a Cuisinart 6 qt. The seller delivered it very quickly in perfect shape. A few nights later I delighted myself and my husband with the classic "lentil" soup. The next night I plugged it in and nothing happened -- NOTHING. I packed it up, returned it to Cuisinart's customer service place which is very near where we live. That was almost 2 weeks ago and I have heard nothing -- no new PC or repaired PC with the appropriate apology. I have generally recommended Cuisinart as a good brand and one that does what it says it will do. I will not do that again.
__label__1 Another Cracked Badger 5: I installed this Badger 5 Disposer in a rental condo about 5 years ago. I now had to replace it because it developed a 4" vertical crack in the upper enclosure (housing). The enclosures used to be made of metal (and eventually rust through), but I now discovered that they are made of cheap plastic. This one was manufactured in Oct. 2006. The value of my time - making 2 trips - was worth more than the cost of the disposer. A leak like this can also cause substantial damage to to the kitchen cabinet and floor. It is sad that the company cannot engineer a better product. From reading the reviews, it is obvious that this is a design defect, not the result of improper use. The other brand I use is Waste King, and I have not had any such problems with their disposers.
__label__1 READ THIS - What you order is not what you get!: I order this polyester flag and received a nylon flag. The vender, WinningGifts, as listed above, told me they don't sell a polyester flag and I got what I ordered! I hope others did not unknowingly receive the nylon flag when the paid for a quality polyester flag.
__label__2 Good Movie, GREAT in 3D!!!!: Growing up, I could NEVER watch any Alice in Wonderland movie b/c that vanishing cat just creeped me out... so, I decided to give it a try again now that I am an adult....and what can I say, I really enjoyed the movie. I first this in 2D and was very impressed by the acting, the imagery, and who can not like Johnny Depp!!! He seems to have a knack for playing the weirdest characters....BUT, the 3D version of this movie just ROCKS!!! it is like this mvie was MADE to be watched in 3D.... it is nothing short of spectacular!!! the images are crisp and FULL of color!!I've never read the book so I can't say if it stays true to story, all I can comment on is what I've seen and THAT impressed me....If you have a 3D TV, I would defn recommend adding this movie to your collection! It is defn worth it! I know I will be viewing it again!
__label__1 if you read the other reviews you know what happened to mine: I've had the t.v. for about 8 months. Last night it decided to just start turning off, losing the picture and sound while it was still running. That's a problem. It comes back on for about a minute and shuts down. Needless to say that if i'm one of many seeing this problem, you would be well suited to buy a different television.
__label__2 Practitioner: This book is a must read for anyone or any company seriously interested in utilizing outsourcing as either a strategic initiative or as a tactic to achieve specific strategic goals. Mike has taken his vast knowledge base and created "the" formost book on the topic of outsourcing.Although currently in the private equity field, I was recrutied by American Express back in '97 as a senior leader to lead their business processing outsourcing initiatives and wish that this book was available at that time. Its content would have shortened the learning curve, assited in avoiding mistakes and added to the value proposition. I cannot recommend this book too strongly.
__label__1 Stick With the Original: The 2 star rating is for the music only. This is some of the greatest show music ever. The vocalists on this version are really poor, even Josh Groban (very nasal rendition version of "Anthem"). The original (with Elaine Paige, Murray Head, Tommy Korberg, etc.) is the best version.
__label__2 extremely underappreciated: i was forced to rent this movie by a friend because it had madonna. The box made it look ridiculous, and I was very uninterested in watching it. As soon as it got going, I was mesmorized. I don't understand what everyone has against this movie, to each his own i suppose, but it has some of the most incredible acting I've seen in many many many years. Forever will James Russo's "I NEED THESE THINGS!!!" be ringing in my ears.
__label__2 A Great Tool: I bought this sander to replace an older model with a non-centered motor.This tool is well balanced and having the motor over the belt makes it much easier to use and eliminates my tendancy to tip the machine and cut into the wood. It is a heavy tool and the weight works in it's favor. The belts are easily removed and installed with the single locking lever.The alignment is easy to adjust and the tool is relatively quiet. I have used it with the dust bag as well as with a vacuum hose. Dust removal is pretty good with the bag but of course the hose is 100%.The design make it easy to sand right up to a vertical wall and that has come in handy.I think this is an excellent tool for finishing large surfaces like tabletops and getting top notch results.
__label__2 Phillips Ambilight: The TV is amazing!!! Have the Ambilight on in a dark room while watching a movie and then turn it off. It feels like your TV just drastically shrank.
__label__1 Bad quality: Pros: beautiful, easy to put togetherCons: the legs in the one I got were uneven, head of one of the bolts in the seat was missing
__label__2 Great Music.: I loved it, fun, imaginative and Not predictable. I have missed the days of good theme albums and it wasnt untill I heard Greendale I realized how much I missed them. Thank You Neil.
__label__2 dog toys: my dog loves these. They squeak and are easy to grab from him. The two pet superstores stopped selling them.
__label__2 Pillow: I bought this present for my boyfriend last Christmas and he currently uses it as a pillow. He loves wolves and I thought that a near-lifesize one would be a good gift. It's not so big as to be cumbersome so long as you don't try and carry it around everywhere, and doesn't have any hard or sharp bits to poke at you, so it makes a great sleeping companion. The fur on his back isn't really as soft as I would like but my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind at all. I think the rough fur may add a little bit to realism as well, if that's what you're going for. Overall I think it's a good buy for anyone who likes large stuffed animals, dogs, or wolves.
__label__2 adventure in reading: How often does a book change your life? For me, the answer is: rarely. As a child there was The Diary of Anne Frank. As an adolescent, The Prophet. Since then I've found important books, quotable books, but few as profound, engaging, generous, and unpredictable as Kelly Winters' Walking Home.We need this book now more than ever, if only for the sheer humanity of it. While the story reads like a magnificent, heart-thumping adventure, it is startlingly candid and full of great humor (I smiled so much while reading it that my face hurt).But you need not be outdoorsy to be gripped by this book. You just need to be up for an adventure in reading and self-discovery.So how has Walking Home changed me? It has given me a compass for truth-telling. It has encouraged me to walk up rather than around the mountain. And it has made me marvel at the simple things.
__label__2 The Thorn Birds--book: Read this book and saw the movie years ago and bought it for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it!! Great story.
__label__1 Outdated & Boring: I bought this book based on the great reviews from other customers. But, I don't see what they see. I see parents and kids wearing clothes from the early 80's and information that can't possibly be more basic. There's nothing wrong with the basics, but there are plenty of books that give the basics and more in a creative and entertaining way. Well ... at least it was cheap!
__label__1 Question: The picture in Target shows 6 rolls and the price seems to reflect 6 rolls; however, no where does it indicate anything other than 1 item. Is is 1 item, a box of 6 rolls? Did not order. Did not want to pay $20 for 1 roll. Would like to order if I only knew what was being sold.Thomas
__label__1 Wish I could lose this book!!!: God!!! The main character so pathetic I wanted her to "end it all". She let everyone step all over her, just taking it? Why? because she was "obese". This entire book seemed to say, "If you drop a few pounds and wear a little make-up your life will fall into place". I truly loathe books like this, because it implies that only as a size 4 can you be happy and have a good job and fufilling relationships. This book really aggrevated me, there are so many other books that RDI offers, don't waste your time on this one!!!
__label__1 Big Disappointment: Well I thought I would try using this for my ipod mini, seeing as other wireless FM products were receiving negative reviews. Much to my dismay, this product did a terrible job. The sound was airy, soft, and could hardly be heard, even when using a portable CD player.Overall, this product was a thumbs down.
__label__2 I read this book a few years ago and I still think about it.: This story just somehow seemed to stick with me... I usually read Romance, but was given this one day. I couldn't put it down. I'm normally a wimp for suspense, but I just HAD to find this book again. I thought it was fantastic!
__label__2 Excellent!: Been using hot water bottle for a while, I thought it was good. This thing kicks butt! Would buy again!
__label__2 Smashing! Bombshells of the world, unite!: I absolutely love this cute, charming, adorable little book, and I find myself referring to it when I need a pick-me-up and a smile. It's not gospel, it's an homage to the immortal bombshell and everything she stands for. Magnifique. Mwah!
__label__1 Back to the library within 48 hours!: Maybe it was just too 180 from my latest summer reading selection (Midwives), but this book just bothered me. I have a shelf of Rice books; I've done the standing-in-line, book-signing thing. I've even walked by her house in New Orleans, proof positive of a devoted fan. But "Armand"... I felt embarrassed reading it, for myself, and for Ms. Rice. I dumped it into the drop box at my local library, unfinished. All I could think of was Lestat, on horseback, racing away from the wolves. Now THAT was a story.
__label__2 Very good product: I was about to go out to WalMart and purchase another flimsy garment rack when I thought of Amazon.Com. When I read the wonderful reviews for this product, I decided to order it. I had to wait till payday because it was more expensive than the ones I had bought in the past.When I purchased it, it was easy to put together, and it has certainly proved to be sturdy. I love it. I'm going to buy another one. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a very sturdy clothes rack. It is definitely worth the price.
__label__1 Completly unimpressed: As an avid reader of books about America's "gilded age", I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I am sorry to say that I was completly and totally unimpressed. If you are familiar at all with Morgan, you will find Jean Strouse's handling of his business career to be very superficial. Unless all you are interested in is his female companions or his so-so art collecting this is not the book for you.
__label__2 Need some help with your golf game?: Johnny really brings home the basics to every golfer. We all need a tune up once in a while and I enjoy this video more than most of the ones I own. He's a good person that explains what it takes to hit good shots. I especially enjoyed the slow motion high speed film of his swing. Like he says "all that matters is impact". I watch it over and over.
__label__1 dissapointed to say the least: Wow, my hopes were up way to high to expect o great follow-up to WOLG. This new single is so off the mark. I hope this is not a permanent musical direction change for Corrine and Andy. Don't waste your money on this high priced import. It's basically one new track, and an instrumental version, both pretty boring. The filler is just the live tracks from their previous live recording.I'll be crossing my fingers and hope their new release is a return to what they do best. Cool, modern, breezy bossa nova tunes.
__label__1 more food: Should have had more useful products listed.Was going to give it to lady at nursing home who had a stroke and can not talk but it does not have enough food items to help her much.
__label__1 what my Mom said. She hates it too.: These songs are pop garbage and everything that is wrong with radio today. I hope Bo didn't have much to do with picking these songs. Slick, over produced, unoriginal lyrics, just a really disappointing cd.
__label__1 Not happy at all: I purchased this coffee maker less than two weeks ago and it made great coffee at first. Now I brew a pot just as I always have and it tastes like water and is just really weak. The basket continues to drip even after the coffee is done. This is my first bunn and obviously my last. My 39.00 coffee maker worked much better. The speed of the bunn is great but what good is speed with no flavor. Very disappointed. If I didnt throw the box away I would have sent it back.THIS IS THE BUNN BTX B WITH THE THERMAL CAFE
__label__2 Heard only a couple of songs but liked those.: I've only heard about 2 songs but i liked them. Stacie Orrico's "That's The Way(God Planned It)" is awesome. That is a very good song. Also Out of Eden's song "Rolling Stone" is great also. If i were you i'd get ti.
__label__2 Love my Dyson: I love my Dyson, and this attachment is indispensable for cleaning wooden blinds. Wow.
__label__1 How bad could a film actually be?: A new rating system has been introduced into my life since I saw Gerry. Gerry gets 10 marks out of 10 for being the WORST film I have ever seen. EVERY film I have seen is better than this ego trip and as such gets a rating from Gerry (10) to 1 (being a great film). Yes, it had stunning scenery, but no story at all. It was so annoying and frustrating - I can't even describe the anger I felt at paying to watch it.Do anything with your life than watching Gerry.What a shame Amazon dont allow for zero stars.
__label__1 Not recommended: I have been involved with competitive bodybuilding and power lifting for over 15 years. I was looking for something different / new and I thought this would be it. Well... not really. My "holding" strength went way up but the full range of movement strength really didn't budge at all. I followed the plan to the letter and it just didn't have the impact I was hoping for. If you want to get big, train 3 days per week for no more than 90 mins per workout. Train with basic movements for the first 6 months then add to it as you progress. Maximum days of training should only be 4 per week... any more than that and you are just tearing yourself down! And remember, YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT!
__label__2 Self-employed woodworker: I have been a cabinet maker and woodworker for 23 Years. Having checked out and compared features with other brands, I was very impressed with Dewalt's 13 inch planer. I have been using a Dewalt 12 inch planer for a few years with no complaints. The 13 inch has several features that I like e.g.three knife cutter head, two speeds, more ergonomic hand wheel, assisted chip ejection, threaded collumns for a more rigid platform. When I unpacked the tool my excitement suddenly turned to despair. As noted by B. McCoy in another review, the packaging is inadequate to say the least. The planer weighs about 97 lbs. and the carton has no handles to assist in picking it up. The outside package looked damaged and, in fact, the planer's metal base was broked. I never actually got to run or test the tool. I returned it for a refund. I would strongly advise anyone against buying this planer until they figure out how to protect it for shipping.
__label__2 Reinvention at its Best!: It seems like every time Janet releases a new album I feel like I can relate some aspect of my life to the emotions that Janet reveals in her music. I though that Velvet Rope was the most revealing project had ever done. Then I heard All For You. What a great compilation!Janet..you've come along way and as a fan I'm glad for the ride your rollercoaster has treated us to! Thanks for keeping it real... That alone puts you miles above the rest!
__label__2 Very Helpful book!: This book taught me so much. It was a very valuable tool in helping us get more sleep. There is work to do to change sleeping habits, and this book helped me do it. When I did the work the book prompted me to do, my daughter started sleeping 5 straight hours, then 6, then 7. She slept 11 1/2 straight hours last night! But she is almost 4 now! I bought this book when she as a baby, and it made all the difference in the world. I highly recommend it! The baby whisperer was great too, but this one helped the breakthrough occur!
__label__1 bulky and twice the cost of displaydoc system: Good idea but bulky and expensive compared to my displaydoc system which was half the price. Plus, my displaydoc system is expandable and the pages snap in and out so I can rearrange or store unused pages in my filing cabinet.
__label__2 Awesome show!: I watched all the previous seasons and had to see how the series ended. I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed this series and wish it was still going!
__label__2 New Impression of the Wicked Witch of the West: This book has truly impressed me as has Elphaba. The future 'green meanie' known to us all in The Wizard of Oz. "Fabala", "Elphie", "Faye", as she is known by her family, friends and lover, is truly captivating and someone you just may want to know yourself. She is smart, compassionate, and simply misunderstood! I have been recommending this book to everyone I speak with these days and its been touch to put it down. Bonus: Did you know that "Elphie" and Galinda, aka: Glinda went to college together? Or that "Elphie" had a son? Get reading!
__label__2 Another Winner: Caedmon's Call limits their normally broad range of lyrical topics to one -praise of the God of the universe-, but the music picks up right where 2000's Long Line of Leavers left off. This album stands in brilliant contrast to the lyrically, theologically, and/or musically bland "praise" music that has characterized the last 30 years of Christian publishing. The songs are enjoyable, substantive, and for the most part, new. This adds up to another great record from one of the best acts in the country today. My favorite track: while the music is catchier on some others, the lyrics to "Thy Mercy" are the most profound on the album.
__label__1 Won't buy again: I bought this because it's important for me to use organic products for my two-year old, and I used it too. I thought, you know, baby wash, you can use it for the body and for shampoo. For the body, it's fine. But seriously, it made my scalp dry and itchy. I think it was fine for my daughter's hair. I thought it would be like Johnson and Johnson baby wash, usable for both hair and body.Finally, I just CAN'T STAND the strong smell of the baby wash. I think that's what did it for me. I've grown to hate the strong smell. I bought it because I like lavender, but it's all Tea Tree. Tea tree is just TOO strong, I mean come on, they recommend that you put drops of Tea Tree essential oil in your own homemade cleaning supplies.Ok, that's it. It does clean, does the job, but it smells too strong. I won't buy it again. Maybe, MAYBE, I would try a different scent. But I don't know. Hope this helps.
__label__2 Childhood memories: The Bestest Present I have ever bought myself! I watched this movie so much when I was younger! i loved it and wanted to be able to share it with my kids in the future. So glad to have a piece of my childhood that kids from any generation will enjoy.
__label__2 The BEST: When I first saw it, I immediately knew this would be the Oscar winner. And I enjoyed it just as much the second and third time. True, there are better singers and dancers, but then again, those people usually cannot act. I thought everyone associated with this movie did an outstanding job. And Rene Z was robbed--she nailed the part!
__label__1 So bogus the book levitated into the trashcan.: The other Lawson book I read, Second Perimiter, was pretty good, so I got this earlier book - That was a mistake. Maybe he was just learning his trade on this one, but the hero, DeMarco was doing things like refusing to arm himself or take simple precautions when he knows his life is threatened. Later, we have the scene where he is talking to a woman at her remote house when Surprise! the bad guy and his elderly boss suddenly join the conversation. They were not heard driving up or walking on the porch ? That was too much for me and I tossed the book.
__label__1 rattle oven: I PURCHASED THIS OVEN FOR MY WIFE. WE'VE USED HOT AIR OVEN'S SINCE 1992 ARE OLD ONE QUIT IN NOV. 09 SO I BOUGHT THIS ONE. CLEANED IT, PLUG IT IN AND LET ME TELL YOU. IT RATTLED ACROSS THE COUNTER FOR 2' JUST WARMING IT UP. I CONTACTED THE COMPANY THE 1ST jAN 2010. DID AS I WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE MANF. REP. gUEST WHAT! HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THEM. i HAVEN'T. STILL HAVE A BAD OVEN IN THE BOX. AND WAITING. i KNOW THINGS HAPPEN. I understand. My wife don't. But then it was 1 of her presents. Hot air oven's are great! We just got the lemon. Sure wish I'd hear something. I will make me think next time before I purchase something over the internet
__label__1 Comfortable but not long-lasting: I was looking to find some high quality socks that would last for a few years (like the old style wigwam cotton socks; NOT the low quality stuff wigwam is selling now) instead of weeks or months. Thus, I tried the grey style Gold Toe socks and the first pair shows holes after a few weeks. They are certainly comfortable but seem otherwise average. Taken into a account the higher than average price this results in only two stars.
__label__2 Very Helpful Book With Lots Of Accurate Info.: After aquiring my first Frenchie puppy a few months ago, I read this book cover to cover. Now I use it almost daily as a resource--I even quote this book at my vet's office. I would definitely recommend this book to any future Frenchie owner as it has really been a lifesaver for me.
__label__1 Disappointing: There really wasn't anything useful in this book. I was terribly disappointed especially since I enjoy so many of his other books. My biggest gripe is it's just a little bit of folk lore, with a number of differing meanings for any one thing but nothing conclusive. It could mean "this", or it could mean "that". Don't waste your $$
__label__2 Great case: This case is awesome! Sturdy and looks expensive. It fits the Photon really well and best of all my hubby likes it!
__label__2 Great: I recommend this book to anyone having problems communicating with people, does not have to be your ex. Book came promptly and as expected. Nice transaction.
__label__2 Surprisingly capable!: I have been very impressed with the clarity of this small unit. I have used in violin lessons, and at band practices and performances. It is one of the best voice recorders I have used. Highly recomend it.
__label__2 there's some hope left...: I recently got in this mystery-esoteric information kick ever since I read "The Da Vinci Code." "The Dante Club" is around the same neighborhood of advanced information and mysterious murders, except this time around, everything takes place in history.I won't compare this to "The Da Vinci Code" since both have their strong suits. "The Dante Club" showcases a group of interesting characters (taken from real-life figures). My only complaint was that the ending wasn't as beautifully rendered. The writing style serves well, even though the initial descriptions of Dante's hells disturbed me a bit.I do recommend this book, even though it does not draw me into an adrenaline-filled adventure and some plot points were forced. However, several fascinating characters and back-stories make up for all this.
__label__1 not what i expected: Rooty sounds like a Prodigy album gone awry. There's the big beat in-your-face production, but the sounds are all sweet and poppy. There's a few decent cuts like "Jus 1 kiss" and "Get me off", but most of it is just inane noise. I really hate this type of music.
__label__2 Water for elephants: An amazingly thoughtful, well written book. A great story of circuses and circus life........loved it. A must read for all.
__label__2 Great Buy: For the price this is a great buy, goes well with my espresso contemporary style living room set. Definitely recommended.
__label__1 disappointing: 1st this video was short, second the silly song interuppted the story, had nothing to do with the story, and I didn't get it. 3rdly it just wasn't the best. I love Gideon the Tuba warrior.
__label__2 JUST LOVE JUDY!!!: I LOVE THIS DVD... IT REVEALS A MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT A JUDY GARLAND THAT HER DEAREST FANS ALREADY KNOW... MISS JUDY GARLAND IS A SENSATIONAL HOLLYWOOD SUPERSTAR WITH A 24k GOLD HEART !
__label__2 Too Bad they left out the best songs: The single worse deletion was when they took "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" out even from the movie. They had featured it in the early theater trailers. I think rottentomatoes still has it. (...) Then they didn't put "Thriller" on the album. I don't think it was a rights issue. They'd already had the greenlight to have it on the movie.Having said that, still a great movie and good soundtrack even though most of it is anachronic by about three years.
__label__2 A "Must Have" for Traders!: This excellent book clearly summarizes charting patterns while giving just enough explanation to be easily understood, without becoming tedious. Chart illustrations are provided for every pattern, providing further clarity. A section on "Analyzing Trades" is a wealth of trading set-ups and ideas. Technical analysis is finally demystified in this essential book for traders.
__label__2 Very, very, very good: The album is great, but be careful because once you start listening to it you just can't stop. Very adictive.
__label__1 Little use outside of the U.S. - I will wait for a GSM version: This device seems to be all about vendor lock-in. First the DRM in ebooks... that's awful. Amazon made history by going DRM-free in music with its MP3 store and now they stick DRM to ebooks?.Second, the issue of EV-DO... they should have imitated the iPhone and gone GSM. The World+Dog has gone GSM, with the only exception of the U.S.In short: they should release a GSM version, make it DRM-free, make it able to read PDF files and other popular eBook formats (like eReader).
__label__2 Compelling: this is one of the best works of fiction i have ever read. everything about it is superb. i have read a lot of books and i can say that this is definitely one of my favorites..up there with Einstein's Dreams.
__label__2 More fun with Thomas: This is yet another toy to expand the imagination -- now how am I going to fit this on my child's track set? This one is easy though. The one track piece is not connected to the barrel loader so you can put it anywhere. Even better, you can take it to grandma's house and play with it without having to take any tracks. Definitely a perk.
__label__1 Will fit your head if you're a child not a man: This Xbox 360 Head Set Communicator is terrible size wise... It wouldn't fit me (a 21 yr old)... The mic came up to cheek and didn't swivel down only up which makes no sense... If you have a small head or a child then it will be 5 stars for you...
__label__2 More to Come: Hopefully, there will be more to come from this amazingly talented performer. A good sampling of some of his music, and a second CD of just his chants (what a bonus!). I am deducting 1 star for the packaging though. While the booklet included is interesting and has all of the songs translated, the case is cardboard and the CD's are hard to get in and out. I am noticing too many companies getting cheap by not including the jewel case-type CD packaging.
__label__2 Mentioned in The Power of Positive Thinking: I don not consider myself a very religious person at all. I read The Power of Positive Thinking and this book was mentioned so I thought it was worth a read. I was amazed by how effective some of the techniques are. It's not preachy at all, just a down to earth guide to using prayer more effectively.
__label__1 lacking instructions: Good 'idea book' for a beginner. Projects are simple and basic...low quality miniatures done well. If you are an intermediately skilled or experienced miniaturist, this book is not for you. The projects are easy enough, most are made with paper, buttons and beads. Over half the projects are made with polymer clay, which is fine, but the instructions for all clay projects are poor, i.e. "make from polymer clay". Projects are all for decorative accessories, if you're looking for furniture instructions, look elsewhere.
__label__1 Fragile: This set is simply too fragile. Several of the black pieces shattered within 24 hours of getting the set. We have lots of tournament style chess sets, and this is the worst I've seen.
__label__1 not that great: My son has beheaded the sun and one of the legs does not stay put on the non rocking feature....but what a pain to bring back to Babies r us......and he really does not last long in this thing...consider something else...
__label__1 Bad: Ghoulies IV is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I feel it is a wasted effort. Prom Night stars Jamie Lee Curtis.
__label__2 Excellent Item: I recieved this item in no time at all. I was more than happy with it. I will shop Dan's Jewelers again for sure. I am completly satisfied and cannot wait to order more items from them.
__label__1 too heavy: These shoes are far heavier than other steel toed shoes I have worn. If you are not on your feet all day, and want something that looks a bit more business-like, then they may be a good choice. But otherwise, I would suggest something lighter.
__label__1 Bought and returned: I bought this because I really liked the way it looked. When I finally received it, it was flimsy, cheaply made, and hard to see the time. Now if it was $15 it might be a good deal, but not for the $40 that I paid. Sent it back the next day.
__label__1 Not For TiVo: After reading other reviews I decided to order this model, listed as a NetgearWG111, to use with my new TiVo system. What I received was a Netgear WG111USA, which IS NOT COMPLIANT with TiVo systems. After over a month I am still waiting for my refund to be credited to my card. The difference is in the details - get them right folks!
__label__2 son's favorite book: My son is almost 2, and this has been his favorite book for a few months. He doesn't seem to be close to toilet training, but he finds this book utterly fascinating! He'll pick this book over Teletubbies (whom he adores) any day! (The book is pretty dated, but he doesn't notice.)
__label__1 tin can on a string: This was to replace a 10 YO Sony portable, but it comes no where close. It's a lot of silver plastic that sounds like - plastic. For its size and weight, I expected much more. Also, the minuscule LCD display is too small to read. The 'mega bass' is a joke - 'on' it approximates a AM radio; 'off' it's a tin can on a string; my $40 PC speakers sound far and above better. Stereo separation is better then expected for a portable, but the lack of any bass/mid's makes this unacceptable. Also, the controls' placement and design keep one guessing as to what is what. It's OK for 'talk radio,' but is guaranteed to disappoint for anything else.
__label__1 Doesn't Work with "Happiest Baby on the Block": I got this because people who use the "Happiest Baby on the Block" system advocated this product. Boy was I disappointed. Happiest Baby recommends a tight, very tight swaddle, and this thing is in no way tight. While it may stay closed, it doesn't simulate the womb in the way a swaddle should. I found the hospital blankets work best (yes, I stole some).
__label__1 Very Light: This is much more of a "who I think is cool" book than one with any information or analysis. Good for those who want to name-drop, but not for real students of music.
__label__2 WE ALL GO A LITTLE MAD SOMETIMES!: The grandfather of slasher horror films.Anthony Perkins delivers a chilling performance as Norman Bates. This film is based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel.This is really a true classic and should belong to all serious horror fan and film buff's video collection.The remake could never out do this original classic.
__label__1 Consumer Reports found dangerous Metals in this and many other Shake products!!!!!: Consumer Reports found dangerous Metals in this and many other Shake products!!!!!Dangerous levels of Cadmium, lead and many others for people who drink 3 or more shakes a day.... well I don't want ANY metals I don't need in something I'm taking to help my HEALTH!!!
__label__2 Tasty: I got a pack of these for free with my last order! Thanks Pier Mall! Very tasty cookie cracker snack, with a light touch of honey flavor. My friends liked it too. I will definitely buy some with my next order.
__label__1 Sad...: what a waste of good paper and ink, not to mention the loss of a small part of my life that i'll never get back. if your looking to learn Haitian Vodou or even New Orleans Voodoo for that matter, i would suggest Voodoo for Dummies before this trash lol. sad, sad, sad...how embarrassing.
__label__1 Sagan's Calculus of Variations: I really couldn't get into this book. And I tried others and they weren't much better. This just must be a tough subject to write about. It comes across as an applied analysis text at the 1st year graduate level. the problems are sometimes hard to decode; once you know what he's asking they don't take much time. but it's tough to figure out what he's asking.i'll keep looking.
__label__2 Classic cute!: These are my favourite shoes. They go with everything and are as comfy as sneakers. I have very wide, hard to fit feet, but thanks to Propet's wide selection of widths, I got a perfect fit!
__label__1 Broke in the Wii after Two Years: I bought this generic Wii component cable because the price was right. However, as is usually the case, you get what you pay for. After about two years of use the plastic head of the cable that connects with the Wii broke inside the unit, requiring needle-nose pliers to remove it. Not good! It is made of a cheap construction quality. While the component video and audio quality was decent, and better than the RCA cable connection, it was not worth the pain of the head breaking off in the Wii. I replaced it with the more expensive better constructed Monster Component Cable. This proved to be of much better quality, as well as picture and audio quality. While the price is definitely good, I cannot recommend it based upon my experience with it.
__label__2 Great Product: I tried thyrotril after seeing my friend use it and lose 25 lbs. I have lost a total of 15 lbs so far. It has helped me control my apetite and gave me the willpower I was lacking.
__label__2 This is a good one: This one works well for me; I like the large ball, the way it fits under my (average sized) hand and the smoothness of the action. It took me a while to get used to the little scroll buttons, but now I can activate them without thinking about it.
__label__2 From National Music Dept On: Hats off to Elder Edgar Petey Madison and EMMC for having some of the best in COGIC Music contributing to this effort--Richard "Mr Clean" White, Bettye Nelson, Kelvin Lenox just to name a few.I like the song "Never Give Up" with LeRoy Burks and Edgar O'Neal too. The harmony on the lead reminded me of Bro. O'Neal and his late brother Eddie. (The O'Neal Twins).
__label__1 Jazz he ain't: Let's not mince words - this isn't jazz. Jamie would be much more at home at a hotel restaurant in the middle of nowhere singing these ballads than as a "pop star". He also gets the "Worst Jeff Buckley Interpretation" award for "Lover, You Should've Come Over". He just doesn't have the vocal or piano skills - I'm amazed that he's gotten this far (actually, I guess I shouldn't, given the current state of pop).
__label__2 Bang for your buck: For it's price, this camera has managed to strike a balance between quality and affordability. 2.11 M pixels is good enough for any amateur, who's not fixated on getting the most pixels possible from today's technologies. The box comes with every thing that one needs to snap away and load JPG files into the PC.Using the camera is pretty easy and intuitive - although I'm a first time user, it just took me about 5 mins to learn the basic functions. FinePix 2300 is also relatively smaller and more esthetically pleasing to the eye in comparison with other models of its class. It's slim and smooth lines fits nicely into the palm of your hands. One does not need to hesitate when wondering "to bring or not to bring" a camera to events/places. I suspect that this little beauty will be going to lots of places with me in the future !!I'd recommend this anyone seeking an entry-intermediate level digital camera.
__label__1 LATE arrival: Arrived in mid-January for a Christmas gift for my husband. Fortunately he received other gifts in time for the holiday.
__label__1 Another dud from Emmy: If you liked Red Dirt Girl, this one is for you. If you lovedthe old Emmy with the beautiful sounds and harmonies withacoustics instruments, avoid this one at all cost. Music isrepetitive and lifeless. Emmy is not a song writer and MalcolmBurns is a very poor producer.
__label__1 Forget this phone!: I oredered this phone from amazon because my other razor went kaput and AT & T no longersells the razor. Since I was so familiar with this product I wanted another one and foundit on Amazon. What I didn't realize was that, although the product was "new" and packagedas such, it was an old model of the razor and even less capable than the one I was replacing.Many of the short cut features of my old phone are not on this one and I find myself constantlyfrustrated that I have to do extra steps for the same result. For instance the texting requiresa couple extra steps as does the ability to find numbers in the address book. I can hardlywait to get an Iphone. Forget it...move on into the new era of product!
__label__1 Batteries: The phone got this rating because I can't use it. I can't get the battery compartment open. I have emailed both contacts on the web page and called the phone number. Got no response to the emails and the phone was always busy. I just hope we don't have another power outage before I can get some help with this. It's my only link when the power goes out.
__label__1 not a laughing matter: This book has a serious title and some common sense material in it although ala the Advice Sisters groundbreaking book Recruiting Love-Using the Business Skills You Have to Find the Love You Want (Cyclone Books, 1998) but it doesn't add anything new to the mix and frankly, it didn't raise more than a wry snicker out of me.You can find humor in nearly everything, and I guess. Perhaps, that is what the author is trying to prove. But, being single and looking seriously for love isn't a laughing matter. It takes motivation, preparation, inspiration, and a dose of continual hope to find the person you really want. The title makes it seem as though a reader might actually find love using "A.K's" method (and why doesn't the author use his or her full, real name?)Better to get your laughs for free on the comedy channel, and save your money for a book that can really help you focus on a love search!
__label__1 I dont see how these guys are so good!: some people say these guys rock and they are totally hardcore. Whoever says that is wrong. These guys dont even sound like As I Lay Dying or Underoath, and I cant believe people relate Comeback Kid to them. Comeback Kid is just a wanna bee screaming hardcore band. They think they are cool but they really arent. There music is full of yelling. Its like this guy wants to scream, but he cant. What kind of a band substitutes screaming for yelling? If you ask me, these guys suck!! As I Lay Dying and Underoath are real metal and hardcore and are way better than these wimps!
__label__2 Not as happy as I was at first: I agree with the other reviewers that KitchenAid product is heavy and sturdy. It does a good job for the money. We purchased it to make easier work of making muffins and sauces.My reasons for only 4 stars are:- the work bowl and lid have broken, both shattered to be exact, after using about twice/week since February 2006;- you have to leave the blade in place after removing the workbowl with more than 2 inches of liquids or it will pour all over the place; and- with the blade in place it's difficult to extract the batter from the work bowl.Other than these issues, we've enjoyed having the use of the food processor.
__label__1 Missing Files Make A Potentially Good Book Mediocre: I was looking for a book that had theory and enough exercises to improve my fluency in use of VBA. This book has the theory but, due to an obviously extremely flawed production process, fails to include the chapter by chapter sample files on its CD that the authors claim are included. This severely constrains its overall utility. Also, as another reviewer has indicated, the authors sometimes play fast and loose with some of their explanations. I could probably overlook this, if the sample files had been included on the CD or if the publishers respected their customers enough to provide them with a page to download the files. Instead, the publishers simply indicate that they will not help title purchasers.If you want to expand your theoretical understanding of Access 2002 and can get this title at a good discounted rate, you may want to consider purchasing this title. However, if you want both theory and practice, this book has very little to offer.
__label__2 Classy Design: I have had this watch for two years now, and it has easily withstood the abuse that I've thrown at it with only a few minor scratches. The crystal is very scratch resistant. The UTC hand is especially useful as a pilot, but the slide rule is so small that you might as well stick to your handheld E6-B when in a vibrating airplane. However, it is legible enough the rest of the time. My watch looks just as classy as the day I bought it.
__label__2 Fun thought provoking read: many brilliant ideas: I think it is a very unique compilation of ideas that are fun to think about. I liked the part about video games and litaracy/reading early on in the book - as well as many other novel thoughts. The book does a good job in considering how "video games" and moder TV actually are more intellectually challenging than in the past, hence; perhaps not a waste of time but cognitivly beneficial activities.Today's video games and TV shows, the plots of, are much richer and more involved than say "pac man" or "Three's Company" of decades ago.This is a very basic snapshot of what you will find within - and a scratch of the surface. If you enjoy Gladwell's books (i.e.The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference) you will probably enjoy this.
__label__1 great movie; poor DVD package: The movie is fantastic but don't waste any $ on this DVD release. It looks like one of those put out quickly to cash in on the Oscar buzz. There are zero extras on this. That's right--no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no making of's, etc.Come on! There is a huge goldmine of stuff they could have done as to how this movie even got made, a look at the actors who we know little of and a look at Mumbai itself.Shameful release really that shows almost no understanding of the DVD market.
__label__2 Getting the Point: This book makes an excellent study for small groups seeking an open perspective on some of the traditional hot topics in spirituality. The study questions are open ended and the responses written by the authors themselves point to the areas where differences of opinions exist. The chapters are relatively short and concise, so occasionally some extra background or clarification is helpful, but there is enough detail to provide for valuable discussion time.
__label__1 Leaks: Worked great for a few months but now it leaks. I always hand washed it and took care of it but I don't use it very much anymore because I can't throw it into my bag.
__label__1 Easily tears in months: I had a changing pad and used it for the first 4 months of my son's life. It developed tears around the straps (I never used them, just tucked them under the cover). The store where it was from took it back and replaced it. The second one has a tear at one end, not near straps or any other wear spot, after only 8 months. The store won't take it back, so I'll be contacting the manufacturer. I wouldn't advise this brand to anyone. We did not mount it on furniture - we just slide it out from under the crib to use it and then slide it back.
__label__1 Definitely not for beginners: There is so much wrong with this video that it would take paragraphs to describe. Just know this: I heard not one word about proper breathing while doing the movements. For me, yoga is most beneficial when done in concert with proper breathing, and I don't think I'm alone in that.. And no beginner should attempt a number of these movements. There's nothing technically wrong with the instructions in this DVD --- they're just not for beginners.
__label__1 Lazy: Mummified Bing Crosby musical from the mid-forties, when the old groaner would amble off the golf course and walk through another tailor-made vehicle without raising a sweat. Adding to the atmosphere of torpor is the laziness of the composer, Irving Berlin -- he trots out dozens of his old hits, while his new originals are totally forgettable. Fred Astaire was a late addition to the cast, which may explain his having the worst role of his entire career -- that of a seedy also-ran playboy who ends up crippled for life after a drunken fall. If That's Entertainment to you, help yourself.
__label__2 Outstanding tool for multi-sport athletes!: The Forerunner 305 has already began to help me perform better on my runs after only 2 weeks of use. It makes me more competitive toward improving personal bests, and keeps me more aware of my current athletic performance. Great Product!
__label__1 Hortizontal Print: I missed if the product description said it was printed on the horizontal instead of the usual vertical. Too weird for me. I returned it.
__label__1 Comedian not funny.: I like Jerry Seinfeld. Alot. The show was funny, all his stand up was funny, but this movie wasn't. And its not just about Seinfeld. It's also about some egotistical manian named Orny Adans who also isn't funny. Don't make the mistake that I did and see this movie.
__label__1 Not much substance: I was disappointed in this book. There's not much substance and no new ideas. I teach remedial composition and found nothing new in it that would help me become a more effective teacher or would help my students become better writers.
__label__2 Black Star: This CD is classic. Mos and Talib did their thang on this joint. Excellent. I recommend it to everyone who loves HIp Hop
__label__2 Appreciation: I appreciate very much that I can find detailed information about OED which I have sought after for a long time. I would love to enjoy the whole things which are offered on this page. Thank you.
__label__2 The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition): The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (Four-Disc Special Extended Edition) is Peter Jackson's vision of The Fellowship of the Ring. Why I start with this sentence is to make sure to make it clear that it differs a lot from the book. That being said as a fantasy movie it is quite remarkable. The special effects are amazing and so is the music. Elijah Wood is perfect in the role as Frodo, as is Mckellen in his role as Gandalf the Grey. Then we come to roles that could been reconsidered, i.e., that of Arwen. This is a very good fantasy film that will entertain both young and old alike. Recommended indeed. 4/5.
__label__1 I've never been so hungry in my life.: Besides being incredibly expensive, I don't like this diet because I spend all my time cooking, cleaning up from cooking, shopping for food and a half hour after every meal, I'm thinking about food again. All I do is eat and prepare meals! I'm so hungry all the time. This can't be good for you. Everything listed as a meal goes right through you. I never feel satisfied. I don't enjoy food anymore. It's nice to spend time cooking but I am quite tired of it. It's a great diet for a very wealthy person who doesn't work for a living and has someone else cook, clean and shop for them. hey, that sounds like Marilu! what a coincidence! By the way, what is Arugula?
__label__2 Himalayan Salt: Really a good product, I have a lot of people wanting to try this out. So here I am again ordering more.
__label__1 patronizing and disturbing: When Covey gives example situations of codependency, which he does alarmingly often, it is always from the _first person_. Don't listen to everything he says because he berates both himself and the reader throughout the book.
__label__1 Type IT: just not what I thought it would be. I expected the pen to pick up the words of each sentence as I scrolled it across the page.It seemes that the button that is compressed to turn on the light just doesn't want to work all the time.half way across the page the light turns on and then it reads a few words and then the light goes out and you end up with half a sentence.After much frustration by my adult daughter, she laid the pen down and started typing the information.I'll wait to make a final judgement after I get to try it, but I did try it for about 5 seconds when she was frustrated and it seems to not function like they say it should.Not totally impressed with this item.
__label__1 Terrible camera work: I did not have any problems with the sound although I have CDs with better sound tracks. But I was very disappointed with the video. The camera work was atrocious even by 1983 standards. No wonder I have never seen this broadcast on TV or cable.Neither the orchestra or the choir are shown in their entirety. There are only side shots, no direct shots. It appears that only two cameras were used and all that changed was the zoom of the cameras which was not very much.I am very sorry I purchased this DVD. I am better off with the CD.
__label__1 Don't rent or buy this movie of pure heresy.: If I could have given this movie less than one star, I would have. This movie promotes Equadistant Letter Sequencing which is heresy because it is saying God said something that he didn't say. I would rather eat my own liver with a rusty spoon than watch this movie again. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that (other than the ELS stuff) it follows the book of Revelation fairly closely. This movie should have a warning lable on it saying "Watching this movie could be hazardous to your salvation."
__label__1 Lack of substance and interest: I've read one other Stone Barrington book and enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to Cold Paradise - what a waste of time. This book read like an Archie McNally novel - light, fluffy, no "thrill factor" at all. I knew from the beginning how it was all going to turn out.If you enjoy reading fluff, you'll love it. If you're looking for a story with some substance, however, skip this one. It's not worth your time.
__label__2 A PERSONAL VIEW OF COMMUNES - CIRCA 1974: Judson Jerome (1927-1991) was an American poet, author, and literary critic, who wrote the poetry column for Writer's Digest for thirty years. However, he was ALSO a "utopian" who moved with his wife and four children to a commune called the "Downhill Farm." He also wrote this sympathetic book in 1974 (subtitled, "Communes and the New Anarchism").This is not a dry, academic study of the subject; in many respects, it is more of a personal "tour" of the field interspersed with his own experiences, developed in chapters such as "What is a Commune?", "From Utopia to Eden," "The New Plentitude," "The New Anarchism," and "The New Consciousness."This is not a useful book for an "overview" of the subject of American communes, but is interesting reading for those interested in intentional communities---particularly those formed in the aftermath of the 1960s.
__label__2 Great, Practical Ideas for Meeting the Demands of Learners: This enjoyable, quick-read has a palatable mix of learning theory and tools that can be practically applied. It is seemingly written by a `regular Joe,' (because of the easy to read, straightforward language choices and real-life anecdotes peppered within) who also employees a keen sense of observation and innate ability to make explicit the simmering trends of American life. The most valuable part of this book lies in the best practices and actual templates that can be customized for use in any organization. The TEL assessment alone, if conducted by individuals with some knowledge of technology, could save a company hundreds of thousands of dollars. I am looking forward to Darin's next book and, yes, if it were a romance or some other work of non-fiction, I would also grab it up!
__label__1 Unbelievable Greed: Sharon is "The Prince Of F*cking Darkness". Ozzy let his wife f*ck over two very talented musicians out of spite and greed. Bob wrote almost all the lyrics and split the music writing with Randy and Lee. Ozzy just sang the songs. They deserve their money. Ozzy is only as good as the musicians that surround him. With the exception of Zakk, his band blows. The current rhythm section's performance is pitiful on this album. The mixing is horrible. The bass is too loud and sometimes out of tune with the backing tracks. The drums? Forget it. Lee Kerslake was da man. His performance can't be topped. I can't believe Ozzy would desecrate the precious few tracks Randy played on with this rubbish. Says alot about what he has become. A businessman.
__label__1 Can I rate this for less than one star????: This movie has been added to my list of the absolute lousiest movies I have ever seen... This is two hours of mainly ethereal, abstract, wildly absurd, funky cinematic junk...the worst I have ever endured. A flimsy thread of a plot about poor parenting tries to hold it together....but regardless of the poor parenting and wildly absurd National Geography type photography of sand drifts, stone scapes,sun bursts,blowing grass,etc....the movie still sucks.Did I mention I thought is was a total waste of time, not to mention, my five bucks!!!! Gees....How do I get my money back?
__label__1 Nice Pictures: I have used two calculus books in my lifetime so far. This one was the second and I just ended up confused. I recomend you find some other textbook. The pictures are nice, but I don't think that the book is well written and easy to follow.
__label__2 What a little Gem: Just received this little Gem. It looks really nice and the size is prefect. Like that it holds a lot of peppercorns. The little serving tray is a nice touch. Highly recommend this.
__label__1 You can dress a pig in lipstick: Self-delusional hack and supporter of Bush's arrogant, imperial presidency doesn't write about how George W. screwed up on Osama or Saddam. No, she's busy demonizing liberal Democrats.
__label__1 What Was She Thinking?: I have no respect for Woody Allen as a person (he remains a great artist), and now I have none for Farrow either. Doesn't she realize the children she discusses in such pornographic, biological detail will have to deal with this book the rest of their lives? That their school friends and (eventually) children will read it? Farrow should have gotten all this out of her system on the analyst's couch, and not sent it to a publisher. There are more kinds of "child abuse" than those she accuses Allen of.
__label__1 Wow I'm broke: I have a sony vaio that is 9 months old, I bought the vista home premium upgrade and it has cost me $400 including the upgrade to get it to work like the ad's show. If I'd have known this I would have waited a year. This is a total rip off and lack of information from microsoft, they say your computer is ready to upgrade but the cool features wont work unless you spend $150 on a new graphics card and have 1 gig of memory. My mac mini which I bought a year ago does everything that vista does. Once you buy the software you are commited to get it to work. Stick with XP, it works, my browser keeps freezing with vista so I have to go.....
__label__2 *sigh*: My husband knows all about Tom and me. He knows that if Tom weren't married, and I weren't married, and if Tom played his cards just right...Monty Walsh has got to be one of my favorite westerns of all time. Tom Sellecks humor, and his honest portrayals of western men is just wonderful. He is a classic, and so is this collection. I recieved it in the mail at my office, and a girl who worked for me said, "Who's the old guy with the cheesy mustache?" I almost punched her in the throat.
__label__1 Big problems with read errors: For perfect DVDs, this drive is fast and smooth. However, when it encounters a bad block on a DVD, it spends over a minute fiddling with itself trying to read that precious block. Meanwhile, the movie is frozen. This makes it almost unusable for DVD playback. I broke a brand new Incredibles DVD from its case, and that played perfectly. But any DVD that has the slightest imperfection is a problem.I haven't tested the recording capability. I was hoping to buy only 1 drive for both playback and recording. This one doesn't fit the bill.
__label__2 LOL: This is one of the few books I've read recently that made me laugh out loud as I was reading. Imagine a book that keeps track of pounds weighed, lottery tickets bought, alcohol units consumed while detailing the life and loves of a thirty something wild woman. I'm older than this book's subject by more than a decade, and it definitely crosses that generation gap.
__label__2 A must-read!: Loved the book...but I have a question. James talks about his big sister Jack. However, she is not mentioned in the end when he lists his siblings and their accomplishments. Does anybody know why?
__label__1 Buyer Beware: I am a very advance crocheter, who has his own business. I write my own patterns, and I am aware of has to be done to get one together.This book is so poorly written. Every piece I have tried from it has gone horribly wrong. I have had to write, re-write, recalculate. The gauge (hook vs yarn) is so off... you will spend more time doing a gauge swatch than working on your project. I agree with other reviews- if there was a pattern tester, they did a horrible job.This book is just not worth the price.
__label__2 Best book ever read!: I love this book! It is her best one, I feel. Her books take you away to another time and place.
__label__2 'Sup dude ?: This toy will be best in the hands of every Disgaea geek in the world.I will juste mention that there is no sword in the prinny's bag.The plush is quite solid : after being thrown quite a lot of times (every friend knowing Disgaea prinnies starts by throwing the plush at you, shouting boom, which makes them sound like 5 year old kids), it is still intact.I disregarded the educational value of the product, yet you can use it to teach children that if they do some wrong, they will reincarnate in prinnies and be slaves in either the netherworld or heaven. I'm not sure if this is really educational.
__label__1 HORRIBLE!: I purchased this video for my 5 year old for Christmas and was very disappointed. Do not make the same mistake. Buy the "Beginner's Bible" series, but do not buy this.
__label__2 mzdeedee21: I bought this for my 3 year old daughter she is so into building and fixing stuff w/ her daddy. After gett'n the toy it looked just like the picture, and had all the lil realistic toys In it. I feel like the 14 bucks was worth it because whhn I went into stores the prices was more, and tool box sets didn't have all the tools. So do I feel its a gud toy yes indeed it teaches them sum everyday concepts to why ppl use tools to fix things whn broken. I'm pleased to have purchased it for my daughters " she is a big helper around the house :)
__label__1 Unreliabe watch: This is a beautiful watch, and I would have given it a five star rating if it had not been for the following: it was purchased about two years ago. I only wear it during overseas or hunting trips. It has been in actual use no more than ten weeks. About two weeks ago, the last time I wore it, it stopped working, reset the time several times and each time it just stopped working. In contrast I have had another automatic watch of another brand for over twenty years and it has never had this problem.
__label__1 the worst: If there was a half star I would of marked that one.2 lids snaped off the first day. Could not use it from then on.
__label__2 Great dual function lens: I wanted a new macro and telephoto lens for my Sony Alpha 100 but couldn't afford to buy both. But with this lens, a flip of the switch allows you to take some very nice close-up shots and the telephoto focus is very clear for a 300mm. I am very pleased with the performance and the price. I will try other Tamron lens now that I have seen what this one is capable of.
__label__2 Works great but too expensive: The adapter works easily, snapping on and off in seconds. It's large but very lightweight. My complaint is this is simply a piece of plastic which could not cost Canon more than 10 cents. Shame on Canon for charging close to $20 rather than including it with the camera for free.
__label__2 Best Soundtrack Music: This soundtrack has the best action music you can find.If you dont have it get it.
__label__1 The Mask of Zoro: I cannot write a review. It has been over a month and I still have not received the order I placed to be given as a birthday gift. It is discouraging that this seller advertises a product they cannot deliver.
__label__2 These work great!: Once I got the correct size for my doggie these shoes work great for protecting his feet. My dog is 9yrs old and is dragging his back feet when he walks. I needed something durable that would hold up to the scraping and these shoes are perfect.The only problem I have had with the shoes is that they rub on a few spots on his feet like a new pair of shoes can give you a blister sometimes. So I did have to get "socks" for him so the shoes wouldn't keep rubbing.
__label__2 One edgy album!: What can I say? Mr. Pompougnac is a fantastic DJ as his Hotel Costes series has proven this. "Morenito" both versions were excellent which the bossa version was also in Costes 6. I also love the lounge influenced "Clumsy". If you like Hotel Costes series then you should grab this one.
__label__2 The BEST Shampoo Ever!: I bought this shampoo as a last ditch effort. I've been a disgruntled consumer of shampoos for a while now, and let me say, I've bought them all. From Kerastase, to Biolage, to Redken, Rusk, Garnier, Tigi, Pantene - you name it. Some were so-so, while many were so full of sulfate-based ingredients, leaving me with rashes on my scalp and hives (I'm allergic). Organix was the first shampoo I've ever noticed to actually say, "Sulfate Free" on its packaging. After one use, I was totally amazed - my normally dry and course hair was silky soft and shiny. This will be the only shampoo I'll ever use, and I encourage others to give it a try - they're currently offering a FULL rebate, so what do you have to lose?!?
__label__2 Great Fun For Everyone: This game system has done something no other system has done before... Got my Uncle, Aunt, Mom, and Dad to Play. They always hated video games, but they love the Wii. This system is so user friendly almost anyone can play. And, it gets people off the chair and moving around.
__label__2 Great Book: This is a must-have book for photographers who are amassing a large collection of photos.I needed to read it 2 times before getting a feel for how to impliment it.Great strategies and it has now changed my workflow completely and for the betterMoney very well spent (although it cost me many thousands more since I also updated my computer, server, and softward to impliment this)Regards, Dean
__label__2 Artistic!: This book is nice for people who have a TRUE appreciation for the arts, you can see all the time put into each design.As you turn the pages, you can sit there and analyze every color, every pattern, everything and be completely mesmorized and at loss for words. Absolutely beautiful craftsmanship, wonderfully created, and nice for people who need inspiration for something a little edgy in their world of artistic design.
__label__1 Leather Gloves: The gloves are fine, got them for my husband for Christmas. Should have paid better attention to the shipping rates. Another company that gouges us for shipping because we live in Alaska. Cost double the price of the gloves for shipping when the company could have just put them in a $5 flat rate box. Will not do business with them again. Sorry
__label__2 No TIme on My Hands: This book had special meaning to me, as Nellie's parents were friends south of Cozad, with my great grandmother. Then after the family moved up to the Sandhills, they lived near my husband's parents.A very good book, by a wonderful author.Carole
__label__1 wimpy and overpriced: Tiny diameter pins are so flexible in their fabric mount that they glide over my bouvier's coat and accomplish absolutely nothing. Even if it worked, I believe the price is excessive and with the extremely high shipping charge from this vendor, the cost of this worthless brush was over $25.
__label__1 I wanted to give it more stars: I really wanted to award Martin Schenk more than two stars for this novel. It started off so promising. I actually read the entire first half in one night, just because I couldn't put it down. Really great characters (even though they were a bit stereotypical) were engaged in an original and believeable tragedy of greed and media hype. Then...I started the last half. It was so predictable, and by the time I was nearing the end, I was actually skipping paragraphs at a time just because the writing was so overdramatic and absurd, I couldn't wait to finish. The entire "revenge of the roots" storyline almost made me laugh out loud. Martin Schenk could have done SO much more with this novel. He definitely has talent, as was apparent in the first half. I just wish he would have used his talent in the second half.
__label__2 Starman!: Starman, written by James Robinson,with art by Tony Harris, Peter Snejbjerg and others, details the exploits of Jack Knight, the son of the aging 1940's Starman, as he struggles with the family business, his personal business and Knight's Past, his, um, business business. It's got science, mystery, romance, cowboys, pirates, and some of the most pure heroism that was presented in the grim and shallow world of 1990's comics. This is one of those great series, Sandman-style, which is loved by comic and non-comic readers alike. This is where I first saw the pencils of Ex Machina artist Tony Harris. I had such a man crush on this creative team, when I met them at a convention in 1996 I giggled Japanese schoolgirl style and averted my eyes. I palpitate at the thought! James Robinson complimented me on my shirt, which I had cleaned especially for the occasion. This is the comic that made me love DC comics, made me embrace my inner collector, and kept me returning to the comic store.
__label__1 Landfill: One word sums it up...LANDFILL.If you need five words,Ink sucking, nozzle clogging landfill.
__label__2 Optilux 1450 Fog Lights excellent deal: Put these lights on a '99 Buick Park Avenue and they have done an excellent job of providing light on the pavement directly in front of the car. These little lights are well made and should stand up to the job if properly mounted. The light pattern is oval shaped. I did remove the black shields as several others had recommended and there doesn't seem to be any glare that affects oncoming traffic.
__label__2 It never ends!: This was a great movie then and is now, my kids loved it and enjoyed seeingmthemlook on their face this Christmas as young adults. Great story.
__label__2 EXCELLENT BOOK! All Christians should read it!: I have struggled for years with intent study of the Bible, the history of the Church, and came to the same conclusions as Dr. Moore. I have been sickened by the smug closed minded superiority of some of the Christians I know, who are completely intolerant of every other religion (including other flavors of Christianity)! THANK GOD for Dr. Moore- I can follow the teachings of CHRIST- without the wierd 'invented by man' doctrines of the Church! I had come to this conclusion (after studing other religions such as Hinduism, etc.) just before reading this book. For awhile though, I felt like it would be hypocritical to continue to call myself a Christian, when I could not swallow the intolerance of the Church! I felt like I would have to find my own path. This book will be of great benefit to all people who seek God.
__label__1 Oh my God: This is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made (besides Penitentiary 2) but well worth watching. The soundtrack is nothing short of horrible, the dialogue is childish at best, and the plot line is so ridiculous and outlandish from the very beginning of the movie, that the viewer can only kick back, ... and laugh his/her ass off. Dont pay more than 2 dollars for this movie or you might want to destroy your home.
__label__1 Does not fit: I received the item and was pleased to find that the product is sturdy (I had previously used the tupperware cup shake and lasted for a few years, until I accidently grinded the top cover). However, this new tupperware cup shake took me a good few mininutes to forcefully fit the lids (one for the cup, and the other one for the top lid) initially because they did not fit. And it continues to give me hard time to close it each time I open to drink out of it. I'll return the item.
__label__1 sequel runs out of steam: I enjoyed the previous book, but was terribly disappointed that this book does not bring the story to a conclusion. enough already!
__label__1 Very Powdery. Not much flavor: The product is not as fragrant as I expected. The color of the lemon peel powder is very pale. Not much of the taste and smell. I rather go to Penzey Spice and pay more for the quality. Also with Barry Farm, the shipping of the product took so long. You pay for the price of the product. Also, shipping is too expensive for the small amount.
__label__2 Awesome quality: The color is actually darker when it's brand new. It was tight in the beginning but super comfortable after wearing for 2 days. I will purchase another pair of Clark's shoes very soon.
__label__1 Loves it at 8 months old: At first our baby seemed to only give this passing attention, at 3-4 months old. Now at 8-9 months old, he absolutely loves it! Sometimes we have a hard time buckling him in, because he is reaching for the pictures - especially the ones of animals. Plenty of picture cards to rotate during a car trip of several hours. It's well-constructed and easy to install/use.(I wasn't able to change the star-rating but would now give it four stars.)
__label__2 Pagan Born: I had heard of Inkubus Sukkubus from doing a search on Pagan videos on Youtube. I listened to as many tracks as I could and when I could not hold myself back I bought the Album. Every track on this album speaks to me in ways I haven't had done in a while. As I write this review I am listening to it. My favorite tracks are: 1. Pagan Born. 2. Burning Times and 3. Church of Madness. Blessed Be.
__label__1 Horrible!!!!: To this day I still do not understand the praise this movie gets! I get what the movie is trying to do. I get the whole racism, old man in a new world, coming to terms with yourself...blah blah blah. Those things are all well and good if they are done in a halfway decent fashion. First off the acting is on par with any Soap Opera on TV. I could barley sit the through the thing because of this. I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie. Second the whole story is just corny as hell. This is pretty much it "Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace ". The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass. It was so over dramatized....I can't even stand to talk about movie.Do you self a favor and skip this Over Hyped piece of garbage!
__label__1 This movie does not even deserve 1 star.: First off, the only reason I gave it a star is because that was the lowest I could give it. This is the probably the worst movie out of every movie out there. Sure the title may make it sound like it is violent, but it is like the Walt Disney version of horror movies. This movie is not even worth the $3.50 I paid to rent it. Movies like this should be banned. If you want to really waste your money and/or see why I hate this movie than I suggest you go and rent it first. And I promise you that you WON'T like it. This movie is about as bad as Linda Tripp's looks or Monica Lewinsky's cholesterol level.
__label__2 Fantastic Book!: Definitely recommend this book for any beginner in aromatherapy. I was skimming through a copy of a friends book and this is what inspired me to learn more. I bought my own book, and some oils.(very pleased with Edens Garden) And have had great results with several of the different recipes. There are no pictures, which does add to good book, but nonetheless alot of very useful information.
__label__1 Not what I expected: I bought these thinking they would be great.I was wrong. I give my baby breast milk and its just a hassle. I figured I would be saving time because I wouldn't have to clean a ton of bottles everyday. Well, you aren't able to heat the bottles with the liners in them so you have to get a container dirty anyway to warm the milk and then dump them back into the bottle. Plus you have to keep buying the drop-ins. If I'm going to have to clean bottles anyway I'd rather use a bottle that I can store milk in AND heat the milk in.These bottles dont keep air out. Even when I would squish all of the air out of the bag and put the lid on, by the time I went and got my baby and put a bib on her all of the air was back into the bottle. Also they are not good for on the go. There is nothing to protect the liner on the bottom so anything could puncture it making all of the milk leak out.I also dont think they are close to being like breast feeding at all
__label__2 Interesting: I found this very interesting especially after seeing the documentary on the prophecy of Atlas Shrugged. I am eagerly waiting to see part 2 even though the reviews haven't been that good. I have often found that I love movies that the critics hate.
__label__1 Not worth the money!: I was unimpressed and learned nothing. It might be worth mentioning that this is self-published by the authors. I wish I had known that--my opinion is that an established publisher would have a hard time marketing it. Just very muddled and not helpful at all.
__label__2 Exact vacuum bag for my Eureka: These are perfect for my Eureka vacuum. I cannot imagine the price is so economical while quality is really good.
__label__1 Do a little Macro research too!: I was interested to see in the credits, that Shatner did some research into micro science, i.e., nanotechnology and DNA. However, he missed looking into the macro science of geostationary satellites. A geosynchronous satellite CANNOT be placed over San Francisco. Nor can it be at 350 miles, nautical or standard. The only position(s) for such satellites is in a ring at approximately 22,300 miles over the earth's equator.The space elevator in SF is not a new concept. Arthur C. Clarke's "The Fountains of Paradise" is the first SF reference I know of. The center of mass for the whole elevator system must be at ~22,000 mile point. A platform could be placed anywhere along the path from ground to mass center point, 350 miles up, for example. It still couldn't be anchored at San Francisco.
__label__1 Over Produced Musical Theatre!!! Trash is being gentle!: This is DJ over producing as he began to do in Styx! And now, he has no one to answer to but himself! I liked "Desert Moon", the single when it first came out. As a huge Styx fan bought this album on its release with high hopes! However, those high hopes sent me plummetting to the earth, landing in the desert without a camel, food or water! I must say that whenever someone tells me about the worst song they have ever heard, I hear them out and put them to the challenge. I bet them that I can give them one that is even worst then theirs! I play them DJ's version of "FIRE" and they go running to the hospital with their ears bleeding from the pain of having to listen to such a great song distroyed. The performance throughout this album is pure & simple - TRASH!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!
__label__2 So far si good: We bought this broom/dustpan for our RV. This is our first trip using it. I especially like the front edge. It really does direct everything to go into the dustpan not under it. I also like that it can hang up as space in an RV is limited. When it arrived it did not seem asstrong as I had hoped, but as I said in my title......so far so good.
__label__1 boring: Well, if you ask me, the Herbert/Anderson team aren't doing a very good job with Frank Herbert's legacy. The characters don't have any depth, and the plotting isn't much above Buck Rogers. You'd think that Brian Herbert would have learned something about developing complex novels from his dad. Even more bothersome, is that they don't seem to be following the clues about the Old Empire that Frank Herbert dropped here and there. And I don't know how much of the Dune Encyclopedia had Frank Herbert's imprint, but the characters of Butler, Holtzman, etc. directly contradict what's in the Dune Encyclopedia. Don't waste your money on this book until it comes out in paperback...
__label__2 Great Showerhead: This showerhead allows me to use less hot water. It looks great and was very easy to install. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 A book worthy of reading.: David Gemmell is one of the best authors I have ever read. His books pull you in and you feel you are living the life of a Rigante. His writing is poetic and his characters are so life like you feel they are alive. His literature is addictive and I find myself re-reading his books sometimes three times."Ravenheart" proved a joy to read. Kailen Ring, Maev Ring and Jaim Grymauch fill your heart with pride and love. His characters are not perfect which is a reason you can relate to them. The conflicts between the highlanders and the Varlish are well thought out and the human emotions are written so well you experience them along with the characters.This book combines the elements of magic, love, and war into a novel worth reading. Few books cause me to shed tears but all of the Rigante series have thus far. This book moved me the most. I cannot wait to re-read this one and to read the seaquel "Storm Rider"
__label__1 rip off!: Gee... this probably would have been a nice shoe organizer IF THEY HAD SENT ME THE SILVER HOOKS TO HANG IT! The product actually said that the hooks are not included in tiny lettering.....
__label__1 Cheap, underpowered and unreliable: I bought this lathe for use by young folks - it has seen VERY little use. Two tool rests have broken - both due to faulty castings, the power supply failed with less than 20 hours of operation and the cost to replace is 1/4 the cost of the lathe itself. How long will the new power supply work? Get almost anything else (besides Harbor Freight) besides this lathe or anything from PSI. This lathe is junk, and customer service from PSI doesn't happen....
__label__1 Trash: I looked through this book and the sequels at the store the other day. Seems to be total trash, and not suited for teens at all.I don't know how publishers who put out this kind of crap sleep at night.
__label__1 Pulsar Watch: Love the style and practicality, but reliability falls short. It lost almost a second a day, and stopped several times in the middle of the night as the day and date was changing. I even had the battery changed and nothing improved. The other problem is that the hands don't glow in the dark. After about three months I sent it back to COSERV (Seiko/Pulsar Warranty), and haven't heard anything for three weeks. I wish they'd just send me a refund so I could buy the Citizen model.
__label__2 Does its job. Cheap, effective.: I bought it with the goal of controlling it from a computer. It doesn't have the flexibility of some other cameras for this purpose. But it works.
__label__1 Someone published this????: I've seen Fern Michaels name, but never read any of her books. This particular title was given to me by a friend. Since the premise sounded intriguing, I thought I'd give it a try.Heavens! I kept checking the cover to see if it really did say"'New York Times' Bestselling Author." I can't believe something so poorly written was even published, much less by a bestselling author. Not only is the plot incredulous, but the writing is stiff and stilted, there are dozens of missing transitions between one event/quote and the next, and it reads more like a first draft than a finished novel.A quick look at the Amazon listing for her other books shows several with great reviews, so perhaps this one was an anomaly, but I'll never know for sure, since I don't plan on reading any of her other titles.
__label__2 passing of a trazan fan: saddly i report on the passing of sarkis atamian on 12/27/2005..after a long illness and being unable to finish origins #2...hail and farewell...ken humphreys
__label__1 I couldn't finish it!: I could not force myself to finish this book. I have always loved to read and enjoy many genres so to not finish a book is a big deal for me. It's even bigger to come here and post a review.I found the characters cliche; this is not necessarily bad but these girls are so poorly developed that I found them annoying and fake. The heroine was weak, the dialogue was bleh.The other thing that really bothered me was the editing in this book. Multiple times I noticed words missing in the text.I'm awfully glad I checked this out at the library instead of paying the Amazon price for it. A waste of money. A bigger waste of time.
__label__2 Satisfied: I was sent Hershey's w/ Almonds also. I thought I ordered the Hershey's Milk Chocolate but was sent Hershey's with Almonds. After looking back in my confirmation e-mail, I did indeed order the Hershey's w/Almonds, $9.00 more than the plain bars. All 36 bars in arrived in good condition and I'm satisfied with the process. Now I remember why I ordered what I did. In order to get FREE Shipping, your order had to be at least $25.
__label__2 Great price for a basic unit: No complaints. Excellent price. No fuss DVD player. Very compact easy to place. Set up is easy. I have an earlier model...still use it. This one is smaller. No problems with either one.
__label__2 A Masterpiece: This book is INCREDIBLE. I had a C in US History, and after purchasing this book, it jumped up to a B+ in a matter of weeks. This book is an excellent resource. It contains information that helps even the worst of students. What i like most about it is it's layout and the text. It is so easy to read! If you don't have this book, your US History class is lacking something: INTELLIGENCE. Buy it now!
__label__2 Great buy...but sharpen your fingernails: These are excellent bar clamps at a great price. I've used many different bar clamps and these are my favorite. I want to warn you about one small thing....be prepared to spend some time scraping the bar code labels off- like an hour. I wore out both thumbnails and a razor blade just trying to removed them. I don't know who puts these additional bar code labels on but I sure would like to have a close-up conversations with them!
__label__2 Excellent thriller: I had never heard of this author and picked up the book at a thrift store along with a number of others to bring with me on vacation. What a find!Now I'm going to go back and read all his other books!
__label__2 Mary's Field: Reading about someone else's struggle with this thing we call life can help us view our own life. Struggling day to day and at times wondering if it is all worth it. But just hanging in there eventually you come to a turning point in life where it can make all the difference in the future.I love the way that Vic writes. His use of language makes this story seem so real. If your struggling with hard things in life this book might help you figure things out.
__label__2 Excellent in depth info .... average test prep: I just passed the test using this book for preperation. While it gives an excellent, in-depth overview of Photoshop, it falls a little short in actually preparing you for the test. I would highly recommend this book as a review before your test, but don't count on it giving you all the answers. Experience is the best study guide.
__label__1 Too Zealous..: He titles his book "Mormon Doctrine" and then goes on to explain that this is his personal study of Mormon doctrine. I don't like the author, I don't like the material, I don't find it helpful, I find it long, drawn out, confusing, bigoted in many areas. His style is to set the record straight on everything he can think of. I give it two stars as opposed to one because he actually references his words.If I were Mormon, I would give it a higher rating. This is a book for Mormons who are already ingrained in the faith. It will be of no help to investigators or the just plain curious.
__label__1 Good principle but doesnt work!: I think this is a fantastic mobile with great music and 3 d motion. However mine stopped rotating after roughly 3 weeks and Tiny Love will not answer my queries. What use is an expensive mobile that doesnt aimate my baby??
__label__2 Better Specs Than An Integrated Amplifier: I wanted an amplifier that would get the best sound out of my CD player. This relatively low power receiver has better specs and sound than some integrated amplifiers for hundreds of dollars more. Granted it doesn't have the bells and whistles of many other receivers, but if you want a stereo receiver with solid fundamentals then this is your ticket.
__label__2 This is a very good book: It makes economics alive. Supply side is still alive. Easy to read easy to understand.
__label__2 Helpful Eye Opener: I read both of Dr. Perricone's books and found them both to be of great interest. Prior to this time I never paid a significant amount of attention to my diet. Since reading I've commited myself to having more Salmon and following the other dietary advice. I don't think you can expect miracles from a plan such as this but I do think that every little bit is going to help.
__label__1 I really wanted to like this movie...: ...but it disappointed on too many levels. It's not a clever movie, it's very poorly acted, and the special affects just aren't special. The trailer was much better than the actual movie. I think - cuz after 15 minutes I threw it away
__label__2 an excellent book for thos experiencing the loss of a child: Somewhat difficult to read due to the translation of a very alliterative book, but worth the effort. You can feel her pain and emptiness. You can also understand the healing, but constancy and ever presence of her loss.
__label__1 Eye Liner: Very difficult to apply the color in a thin line. I ended up not using it and throwing it away.
__label__2 A New Spin on MMW: It took me a few times to really get into this album, but the love is there. "The Dropper" is a lot different in my eyes to previous albums. "The Dropper" is a lot more free and open jazz. The songs are really space but still amazing. It seems that Medeski Martin and Wood finally achieve what they are trying to do with this album. The songs aren't very structured, but its on purpose. The keys are a little bit too spaced out sometimes, but the increadible rhythem of the drums and bass keep it all in line. If you liked "Shackman" you should love this album, although I like "Shackman" a little bit more. MMW showed a new style which you can get hints of in "Combustication." If your a MMW fan i suggest adding "The Dropper to your collection.
__label__1 Pre-written Sermons?: Ok first we have George W Bush trying to become president and now this! I need oxygen, this is just too much stress for my poor heart. Let me see if I get this right...the book has detailed (fine ones at that) sermons on Gods Gifts to each of us...and this was written in the original intent that preachers and pastors would use this sermon...the ironies of it all. Forgive me if I am wrong but I thought that pastors spoke with the leading of the Holy Spirit...does not Jesus say not to worry about what to say because the Spirit will talk through you. Therefore it is silly to have a book about pre-written sermons. That is like borrowing the Smiths answering machine to use at the Martin's home. And the kicker...the sermons are all about Gods Gifts....apparently if a preacher buys this book, he doesnt have the gift to teach!
__label__1 This DVD must be a copy of an original movie with more exceptional characters.: I don't have much to say about this movie other than I just watched it to see if it had any good aspects. Sorry, but it just wasn't worth the time.
__label__1 Pretty Good: At times it's tempting to write her off as a dilettantish Shania wannabe. She has a fine voice. At times the song selection is questionable. Overall a good effort.
__label__1 Bought 3 - None worked: I bought 3 of these tank floats. All 3 of them failed to cut off the water flow like a tank float is supposed to. And I had the water pressure turned way down. I ended up w/ a half-flooded stall & over watered paddocks. I've used tank floats for 15+ years & these are the worse ones I have ever tried. I am waiting to see how the seller.responds as to my needing to return them.UPDATE: Okay. I only got a short, no help response from this vendor telling me to deal w/ my problem w/ the manufacturer. No exchange or help whatsoever. Told me they were used so couldn't return. How would I know that these floats didn't cut the water off like they are supposed to w/out hooking them up?! Anyhow, Amazon came through after I contacted them & they refunded my money through their A-Z Guarantee. This seller has NO customer service. Never replied to my response to them after being told to contact the manufacturer. Have never heard from them at all since. Be careful dealing w/ them!!
__label__2 Cinderella With An Attitude!: Violets in the Snow is the funniest, sexiest take on the Cinderella story written. Isabelle is beautiful, pious and charming. John is, according to Isabelle, "no prince." How they get together is pure fun. And it doesn't hurt to have a guardian angel close by. John and Isabelle weave a tale of what happens between the wedding and the happily ever after.
__label__2 A great Second Mystery in the Series by Marklund: Another gripping story in the Annika Bengstrom series. Set in Stockholm they give a glimpse not into only Swedish life but also how a newspaper there operates. The fourth book, "The Bomber" was a hit here but I thought the first two were even better. I'm going on to the third, "Primetime" next.Annika, a young newspaper reporter, deals with resentment from many of the permanent staff at the newspaper as the result of a shocking incident in the first book, "Studio 69", while she tracks down a mysterious organization that seems too good to be true. In the process she is involved with the Yugoslavian Mafia and the dangerous Ratko. A gripping story all the way.
__label__1 Not intuitive and buttons do not work after a few months: The setup and design of this remote is not very intuitive. The computer interface requires navigation through multiple screens and many of my products required quite a bit of playing around before they worked like I wanted. However, after a few hours of setup, most things worked fine.My biggest gripe though is that about a year after buying this remote, many of the buttons don't work. In fact, pretty much all of the buttons we use on a regular basis are completely useless. This despite the fact that we have taken extremely good care of it and it still looks like new.Also, a number of our electronics aren't supported by the remote such as our Sony Google Bluray. I'm sure it would function with a lot of work on my end but since the buttons don't work it would be a waste of effort.I am very unsatisfied with this purchase.
__label__2 awesome product: Great product for the price.Very easy to put up.Last time we used it the temperature dropped down to 30 at night and we were fine.I like this tent a lot. It is light and doesn't a lot of space.Definitely a bang for the buck!
__label__2 Awesome Book for Concealed Carry: Great book for someone looking to build their knowledge around Concealed Carry and Gun Handling. The is a awesome book for your library. This is on my must read list, one that needs to be reviewed regularly.
__label__2 Awesome album!!!: This album is awesome. Its like a mixed cd with every song u would actually want to listen to. By far dis is tha hottest cd Ive heard in 2004. You can't go wrong when you got stars like 112, p.diddy, notorious big, faith evans and appearances by 50 cent and Lloys Banks. With a DVD you get to enjoy it even more!!!!!!
__label__2 Worth the 20 bucks!: I agree that this toy doesn't deserve the negative reviews. There is a safety mechanism that makes it tricky to work first time but once you figure that out it's smooth sailing. Easy to clean, quick setup, fun, just follow the directions! It is a bit noisy but it's not a drum set. I bought it for my six year old last year and he really enjoys it.
__label__1 Look Elsewhere for Light Recipes: I bought this book used and, after having read through it thoroughly, have come to the conclusion it would be overpriced at 50 cents. Almost every recipe calls for hard to find ingredients. Many are neither low fat nor low carb. A few recipes even call for deep frying. Unlike every other cookbook that provides nutritional information, this one gives the calorie/fat/carb counts for the entire recipe, not just a single serving.Also, the "witty anecdotes" from the author (which were one of the things I was really looking forward to) come across as very pompous and self-agrandizing. Mr. Giobbi finds fault with everything from the spelling of broccoli rab to the poor quality of chickens available in local stores.An absolute waste of money.
__label__1 basic: You probably already know more about Persians than the book writer himself.Disappointing.Better to spend more and really Learn about Persian cats.
__label__2 Great relaxation music: My old boss had this CD at work and would often loan it to me to play at my desk. It made the day go by faster and eased some of the usual stress caused by work. I recently bought my own copy, which I play at home during parties. Everyone loves it. Apparently, it is out of print, which is a pity. If you have a chance to get this - and if you enjoy relaxing South American music - buy it at once!
__label__2 50 years of important history, including of Abraham Lincoln: This was a riveting dialog of the life of Charles Chiniquy in his church experiences, including the lawyer Lincoln's defense of him when falsely accused by priests. Also, contained details about the conspiracy and the assasination of Lincoln by church going Roman Catholics. 8 were hanged.
__label__2 Great early recordings: Same review for their other recording I bought. Very happy music from a time that needed it the most...kinda like today.
__label__2 BUY IT: EXCELLENT SYSTEM. ABSOLUTELY NO WIRELESS INTERFERENCE. LARGE BUTTONS ARE EASY TO SEE AND USE. SPEAKERPHONE FEATURE IS SO GOOD ,THE OTHER PARTY DOES NOT REALIZE THEY'RE ON A SPEAKERPHONE. ALSO , PHONEBOOK FEATURE IS EASY TO SET-UP. PROGRAM ONE STATION AND THE OTHER STATIONS COPY WITH ONE COMMAND.
__label__1 Fixed it once, then broke again: After buying camera, worked fine then i started having to reset it constantly. I sent it in, came back working fine. Same thing started up again, and now i cant play back. Also, terrible quality when filming indoors. Very grainy.
__label__2 great for the alabama fan: Great stories from Bear's life with a devotional message. the quotes and Bible verses alone make for interesting reading.
__label__1 Be warned...: This edition is only the first volume of a two-part work. I am returning this book and exchanging it for the edition with the forward by C Vann Woodward as it appears to be complete.Did none of the reviewers here notice that the narrative stops at William Henry - and with the words "End of Vol. I"????
__label__2 I think this song will go straigt to the top: I think that this song is awesome and it is going to deffantly go staigt to the #1 spot! I also think that it is a great tune for the summer but i think it should have came out in the beginning of the summer!
__label__2 Pooh's Top 40 is Tops: I highly recommend this CD for any child's collection. The collection of songs are fun and enjoyable (resulting in many sing-alongs).
__label__1 Again?: Didn't this CD come out a couple of years ago and was called No Shoes, No Shirt, No Problem? The title tracks are the same song rehashed and "Keg in the Closet" really shows how Chesney has 'matured'. Go ahead, vote my review unhelpful, but it's true. Wah, wah
__label__1 Piece of Junk: We purchased a DeLonghi toaster oven and both the toaster and oven functions stopped working right after the one year warranty expired. We barely used this product. When contacting customer service we were told that there were no replacement parts available for our model and there was nothing we could do and nothing they would do for us. My $20 toastmaster lasted more than 15 years! This is the last time I buy a toaster based on appearance!
__label__2 Love it!: My daughter loves this video, as well as all of the others in the Baby Einstein series. If she is cranky, all I have to do is pop this in, and she immediately cheers up. Couldn't live without it!
__label__1 Would Not Recommend: After the second chapter, I had to keep telling myself to "stick with it." I know there is a story in there somewhere, but I felt like I had to really dig to make the discovery. I wanted to take the book apart, cut out paragraphs and chapters and paste them back together in a different order to find a cohesive story. On the positive side, there are some interesting characters and I did enjoy a look at the dogs' side of things. I won't say that I wouldn't try the author again, but I will not be recommending this book to my friends.
__label__1 Not worth the money: I was very disappointed with this book. The pictures of the designs are not placed next to the instructions, they are placed in middle of the book. All the pictures are grouped together on a few color pages (instructions and diagrams are in black and white). The pictures are of poor quality, multiple overlapping pieces of jewelry, laid upon muted "postcard" type pictures. This makes the jewelery very hard to see. Also the designs are old, i saw nothing new or innovated. I will be sending this book back.
__label__2 Very Disturbing Book: You have to give Nelson Demille credit. He has written another outstanding book. I have read two of his books and have recently bought two more because he has proven to be an outstanding author. The subject matter of "Charm School" will really make you wonder if a plot of this magnitude could have really been pulled off with the Russians and the Vietnamese working hand in hand.This book will certainly make you think. Once again Nelson Demille has written a spellbinding book.
__label__2 Kid K'nex are great toys!: My six year old son spends hours playing with his K'nex. We have bought several sets, and he uses the pieces to make some very intentive creations. The pieces are sturdy, and bright colored, and he uses the softer rods to put around his neck and waist; he has made robot breast plates, goggles, an electric guitar, a laster blaster, and a sword and stabbard. It is amazing the things that he has come up with to make with these toys, and he plays with them for hours. It has been an excellent toy investment for us.
__label__2 Looks great, but...: I have many pieces of Farberware cookware that have served me long and well and still look and work great. I have wanted one of these for a long time. This one fills the parameters I want very well...except for the fact that the pour spout is on the wrong side. I am left-handed, and it is very awkward for me to use one designed like this. I have seen some with spouts on both sides, but they are not as nice as this one. I guess I will have to keep waiting and looking, unless Farberware changes their design soon.
__label__2 pokemon pikachu 2: POKEMON PIKACHU 2 ALOT BETTER THEN VERSION I AND 2. IVE BROUGHT MINE A FEW DAYS AGO ... AND I CARNT STOP PLAYING WITH IT. WITH MORE GAMES TO PLAY AND MORE THINGS TO DO POKEMON PIKACHU 2 IS AN EXCELLENT TOY AND IT IS A MUST FOR ALL POKEMON FANS.
__label__2 Beyond Trout and Ries: The Brand Gap picks up where Trout and Ries leave off. It gets into areas that traditional marketing and positioning books fear to tread, namely the role of aesthetics in building brands. As a 30-year veteran of Madison Avenue, I've learned the hard way that it doesn't matter how great your strategy is---it's execution PLUS strategy that moves products. Neumeier is one of the first to recognize this simple but elusive truth. It's enough to give one hope for the future of the marketing business. For that matter, for the future of business. Period.
__label__2 A Must Have for Fly Fishing in Colorado: Marty Bartholomew has not only proven himself as pro for Ross Reels and Scott Rods, an elite fly tyer, and one of the classiest individuals in the fly fishing industry, but he has now proven that he can write the most informative book available on fly fishing in Colorado. As a former fly fishing instructor, I often referred to this book as "The Bible on Fly Fishing in Colorado." Bartholomew attacks every aspect of the waters covered in this book from where to fish it, what to use, how to get there, when hatches are taking place, and even where to park. The Flyfisher's Guide to Colorado essentially takes the reader on a guided trip to the water he or she desires. This book is certainly a must have.
__label__2 Very nice overview: This is a big, fun, overview of women cartoonists from about 1895 to now. It would make a great gift. Lots of full-color reproductions of the work and some quotes from the artists make this a great introduction for anyone interested in women artists. That being said, it is really kind of a "coffee table" book in that the text is secondary. There is no analysis, just a chronological introduction of each artist, and the nature of the book requires that the author can only briefly mention incredibly important cartoonists like Alison Bechdel in a sentence, or not even mention Roz Chast at all. Still, you can't do everything in one book, and some people would not be interested in heavy reading. This book should serve as an excellent appetizer for those who will seek out more about these talented women, and to check out more writing by Trina Robbins.
__label__2 This stuff works! And it smells good, too.: Our dog's belly was bald because of his excessive licking to calm the itching caused by an allergy to the grass he loves to lie on. After just a few days of regular sparying with the Hot Spot Itch Relief Spray, the hair started to grow again. I think he's made the connection, because he doesn't run away when he sees the bottle in my hand....just stands still so I can spray.
__label__2 Level 42's former bassist continues his fantastic solo work.: Mark King's "One Man" is a great album that you will surely enjoy listening. Considered one of the world's best bassist, Mark King drops his famous "slapping" technique for a more "adult" sound. Former LFT guitarist Boon contributes to his album. Of the following tracks "Bitter Moon" and "One Man" are well written songs. A great addition to anyone's collection.
__label__1 What a waste: It is a shame that such great actors would lower themselves and play in a movie that was so bad. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 An eye opener, Aha moments, and Great Advise for Parents of Teens!: I have found the book to be very informative and right-on when it comes to parenting teens. My son is 14 years old and this book has come so handy and the information invaluable. I learned the mistakes I've done along the way and ways to correct and improve my parenting techniques. The book "God's Design for the Highly Healthy Teen" has brought to me the biggest Aha Moments I've ever had. Currently I am sharing this book with my husband because he is more of a Dictator Parent and I want him to realize the emotional and behavioral damage that can cause to a teen who is already going thru so much at this age. I feel fortunate to have read this book while my son is 14 because I still have time to correct and implement great parenting skills that will last a lifetime. Not to mention, I have 2 other sons that are younger and I will do it all over again!
__label__1 This is NOT a good book!: This book has a very "amateur" feel to it, and needs serious editing. The plot is unrealistic, there are too many characters and plot lines, and the writing often seems incredibly "preachy". There is also some sketchy theology in the book, such as a strange interpretation of the parable of the ten virgins where the author says that the Body of Christ and the Bride of Christ are not the same group of people. Overall, I found the book frustrating and annoying. There are MUCH BETTER Christian fiction books out there, don't waste time reading this one!
__label__2 Wonderful: I recieved the train set and set up in the preschool class during the summer. The children loved and we played together while talking.
__label__2 The king of Trend ....: This is the first big book I read on trading. At first glance I thought I would fall asleep trying to read this thing. To my surprise, I find it extremely interesting and read it in no time at all. Love the stories of the famous trend followers and there successes and Misses and why. Also the book is filled with insightful quotes.Anybody interested in trend following as a strategy then this book is for you.P.S. For Investools followers you will find this book a little contradictive to what has been taught. Please bear in mind that this is a different strategy than you were taught and therefore has different rules it follows.
__label__1 Received as advertised, but SLOW shipping.: I placed an order for 1 box of Junket Rennet tablets on July 9th and received it yesterday (July 16th). In the meantime, I visited the manufacturer's website and placed and additional order for 6 boxes of rennet (each box at less than half the price of the box I ordered here) on July 11th and received it on July 14th. Incredibly slow shipping in my opinion, and my one tiny box of rennet arrived in a box intended for an entire case of the product filled the rest of the way with paper, which was a waste of packaging and environmentally unfriendly. In the future, I'll just order directly from Junket.
__label__2 My 2-Year-Old Boy Loves It!: My 2-year old son absolutely loves this movie. I think he relates to the young boy who is the protagonist, but mostly I think he is fascinated by the gentle yet powerful iron giant.He watches this movie over and over and it has displaced Sesame Street, Pixar films and Disney films as his favorite.
__label__2 Best of the series: I have seen all of the productions of this Movie, and this one comes the closest to Dumas' Book. The cast and Colors are fantastic. The Cinematography of today is an advancement, but the acting cannot compare in the quality of the performers in the past.
__label__2 Bone People ..not for the squeamish: Extremely interesting book. The characters of Joe, Simon, and Kerewin (sp) are vividly drawn. The subject matter is serious, child abuse, alcohlism, destruction of culture, despair, cancer, isolation. Yet with all this it is a book that celebrates life.The prose is dense and evocative. The author is excellent at building a sense of place. The descriptions of their time at the beach are incredible. I could feel the rocks beneath my toes and the cold wind blowing.Their are some graphic scenes of violence and pain. The fishook incident made me want to pass out (having put more then my share of fishooks into my own thumb).The discussions of Maori culture just make me want to read more about this period in New Zealand's history.Not the easiest book to read, but well worth the effort.
__label__2 Pole Hedge Trimmer - Battery: 5', 5" 165# senior citizen (male) The battery operated pole hedge trimmer is fine for my application. I use it for trimming on a regular basis, not heavy cutting. Overnight battery charge is sufficient for trimming a very long and very tall hedge. B&D should redesign it with the motor in the base handle using a drive string up to the cutter head. Having the drive motor in the head makes it very heavy to lift high overhead. Overall a good product but not great. Nelson
__label__2 Top 10 Barclona: This is a wonderful guide to Barcelona. We took the Hop-on / Hop-off tours and it was a fabulous guide.....a lot cheaper than other guided tours!
__label__2 Love this movie!!: This movie makes for a great date night movie or girl's night film.. Not as light as I had expected, but definately got some laughs out of it and liked the story line, even though it is a bit predictable towards the end.
__label__1 Best of feel, worst of performance: Razer, I am done with your products.This mouse like all their other products have been the best looking and best feeling input equipment I have ever owned. However the reliability of this equipment is horrible. Over the past year alone two of their keyboards and two of their mice have developed hardware flaws preventing their proper function. In the case of this mouse the mouse started to list in an upward direction whenever I would stop motion.Unacceptable performance, even worse customer support. Love the look and feel but for this price the thing needs to actually work.
__label__2 Useful Tool: This book was chosen by my professor for our German History class. An easy read and very informative. There are great pictures and quotations. I would recommend it for a class or history buff that wanted a good read.
__label__1 Environmental Black Faeries: Buffy novels are usually enjoyable, heart-warming and thrilling. I'm sorry to write, "Unnatural Selection" doesn't offer that. The premise was promising; Willow's environmental activism, a possessed baby and Xander's comic book pal. Hutch, who's chock full of intrigue, could have been developed a bit more. The characterization of the Scoobies wasn't bad, but the plot was so divergent and non-linear. This reader never became fully invested in the novel. The big unanswered question involves the connection between the faeries and the vampires and did Odom completely forget that Buffy had a mother? Odom has written better Buffy novels. Skip this one.
__label__1 Watch Out! Does Not Fit All Honda Shadow Spirit 750s: I have a honda shadow spirit VT750C2 and these did NOT fit. Very disappointing as it advertises as a honda shadow spirt 750 Cobra guard support, but apparently not all shadow 750s fit this discription. So be careful when you buy your saddlebag guards from the internet. Make sure that the guards you're interested in meet the measurements of your bike.
__label__2 Cruden's Unabridged Concordance: The book was shipped quickly. It was in very good condition and contained extensive information. The only drawback was the tiny sized print.
__label__1 Much Too Much of a Good Thing = Overkill: A promising start reminding me of the classic gothic novel, the story line begins to unravel in psychotic episodes supposedly experienced by the character/author. I could just imagine Barker saying to himself "Gee, can't figure out where this is going so let's be truthful and let the author say he's loosing his ability to tell this story." This leaves the reader feeling manipulated and foolish to continue reading hoping that something would at some point "come together." Being a true fan, I stuck it out but was disappointed in the queasy kissy face ending.
__label__2 Pulsar golf spikes: Softspikes PULSAR Fast Twist Golf Cleats Great spikes compared to the cheaper black rubber versions. These spikes are harder,stiffer and last longer.
__label__2 GREAT GREAT GREAT Show!!: I have been waiting for almost 2 months for this CD! Saw the show a couple days after the blackout in NYC! Great Show! I can't wait to get the CD! Really, see the show if you have the chance, even at full price, it IS worth it!
__label__1 PC Bust of all time?: Years of development were spent on this? I mourn for the future of PC gaming. Ridiculous copy protection = EPIC FAIL by the way.
__label__1 Horrible!: I was so excited to get this because it is diffcult to make a cake completely level. I thought it would make it easier. It didn't. The handle is too small which makes it hard to get any sort of force behind the lame wire that is supposed to cut cake. It simply rubs up against the edge of the cake and makes more of a crumbly mess that cut anything. A waste of money. This went into the trash after 5 minutes.
__label__1 Not the stylus: The picture looks like it shows the stylus but the item shown is really the metal refill that goes IN the stylus.The picture may mislead. If you want the stylus don't get this item.
__label__1 Sorely Disappointed: For a minute I thought I had chosen the wrong book. It definitely did not live up to the rating for me. I was left bored and confused. At first I thought it was my timing. So, I picking it up again. I soon realized that this book wasn't for me. I rarely give reviews, but feel obligated to do so when I feel that a book is misrated or is hyped more than it delivers. Anyway, I would suggest a thorough review before you invest in this book. Maybe check it out from the library first.
__label__1 This shows for kids: I have seen this show when I was younger and collected the toys as well. I decided to check out some episodes and realized I don't care for it anymore. This show is for little kids, Scott and T- Bob ruins the series along with huge wipe outs and Nobody gets hurt except for the heroes plus check out episode 12 The Roteks when Matts Thunderhawk crashes and explodes. What are Venom Super Humans Since they're Vehicles explode and not one injury or scratch way too unrealistic.Even GI Joe had people getting killed,There is too many jokes same as the 80s He-Man. I could only watch a few of those since only 5 had Skeletor and the rest were all filler. M.A.S.K. would of been better if Sunbow made it since Dic makes mostly kids shows.If You want to Buy it for a Collection that's Fine But I don't advise watching this series unless your a kid or you have kids.
__label__2 For Basic Math computations, look no furthur: Durable, high quality, sturdy, what you come to expect from the Melissa and Doug line of items. My kids use this with the Rod and Staff math curriculum as an added manipulative to help them with addition and subtraction.
__label__1 If you want Pink Floyd...go and buy Roger Waters In the Flesh: Good music, but In the Flesh has a better selection of the real Pink Floyd music including Animals, The Wall (including mother)and many others (Includes almost all the songs of Dark Side of the Moon). Also better quality and better sound. You need to have this one if you are a Pink Floyd fan, but I enjoy 300 times more, In the Flesh.
__label__1 Use The Library: I would recommend one borrow not purchase this book, and after the half-way point return it. I found the first half extremely interesting and captivating. The remainder loses the reader in a case with racial overtones and fails to establish a logical relationship with the first half. I read a comment by another that seemed apropos: describe a new method of building an office building by explaining briefly a new building method and what the building might look like when finished. And, then talk about some of the surrounding pavement, you'd have "Blink," well--in a blink.
__label__1 Long on gimmicks,short on safety and function: I have really tried to make these work but am just having to give up. Maybe it is just the configuration of my bike but the pannier has to ride too far back on the rack in order for me to pedal. I have tried to add additional bungees to help secure them and even took the rubber coating off the clips that go over the rack to make them more secure all to no avail.Now, the elasticized cord that hooks to the bottom has broken and I have decided to move on.It seems like this company over=designed all the gimmicks (like the cellphone pouch and handle straps) but did not design a product that was functional and safe.
__label__1 Pop Trash: The "Same Ol' Same Ol'" beat is ripped straight out of Dr.Dre's "The Next Episode". At least make your own msuic.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money: This is an awful product, and a waste of [money]. The problem with this warmer is that it doesn't have an automatic shutoff, and it doesn't control the temperature. If you put a bottle in, and get distracted (and what parent of an infant doesn't get distracted), the water just keeps getting hotter and hotter. I have used a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water around the bottle, and after turning my back for less than a minute, the water went from 120 degrees to 160 degrees. The only way to control the temperature is to unplug the product. Not too safe!Don't bother with this product. You can do the same thing it does with a pot of water on the stove and a ... meat thermometer.
__label__2 criminal minds season 8: great season enjoyed watching it cant wait for next season. i'm hoping that criminal minds keeps on going cause it's fantasic
__label__2 Very helpful, but also very theoretical: The problems in this book where very helpful to me in my applied continuum mechanics course, but they tended more towards the theoretical side. A good purchase for students and researchers dealing with solid mechanics and mechanics of materials.
__label__1 Children everywhere learn to hide behind settees...: This episode would get one star from me, simply for starting the whole darn Doctor Who franchise in the first place, but gets another star for the fact that it probably produced a better fight-scene amongst those cavemen in '63 than anything 'Who would ever subsequently see. This episode also presaged the cheap special effects of future years with the BBC's effects budget being saved a bundle due to the chameleon circuit on the Tardis ever so conveniently "breaking" leaving the good old blue Police box to be recycled for all future episodes. Uh huh.Oh, and if this took place today, with a (supposedly) teenaged girl living in a junkyard with her eccentric "Grandfather," Ian and Barbara would be dialling 999 on their mobiles, and a very different story it would have been indeed...- M. Grade, professional Who-hater Esq.
__label__2 Easy and fun to share tunes: I got this just so we could have our playlists going wirelessy through the entertaiment system in our living room. Now when my friends come over we can swap who gets to play tunes through the system. Even the lesser PC guys can play along. Beautiful device, thanks Apple!
__label__2 One of the best game soundtracks ever: I recently bought this and Wow! I have not played the game in a while, and this CD made me want to play it again. I especally liked "Inside Ganon's Castle," which is Ganon's theme played on a pipe organ. Any Zelda fan should get this. It's basiclly a great reversion of all the NES ans SNES Zelda games' music. It's the best one out of the N64 soundtracks.
__label__2 Raw Album 110%: This is on of the best albums of the year. Lynch has gone crazy once again. It is a little diffrent then season of da siccness.On this album he lets off all his anger and emotions through his music. He raps about differnt things now but still has that sicc [...] flow. Every song on the track is off da hookespecially spydies birth and death dance. go and cop this albumreal soon. If u like gangsta rap go and pickup J-Diggs Both Sides Of The Gate, the whole c.d. is off the hook!
__label__1 Not worth over $50.00: This book is a disappointment. it has nothing to do with restorations. This book covers the difference and the history of each model. The photos are black and white, for $175.00 you would expect colour. The original list price was $29.95; I doubt it is worth over $50.00 today.There are better books out there for a quarter of the price that cover the same information.A better buy for restorations would be Triumph 500-750cc Twins 1963-1979 Service-Repair-Performance manual by Clymer Publications,oh well ripped off
__label__2 What is real?: I must say, this movie is not at all what I expected it to be. It was in Empire magazine's "Greatest Horror Films Of All Time" issue, but I don't know if I would call it a horror film at all. Even the box says "a psychic thriller", which it most certainly is. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are stupendous in their roles, but the best character in the movie is the Venice setting, helped out by the beautiful cinematography. The parallels between the slowly sinking city and Sutherland's downward spiral is made all the more real by the melancholy and dark feel of the scenery. This is a true masterpiece that transcends genres.
__label__2 One of the Best!: Next to the "coldest winter ever" By Sista Souljah. This was my next favorite! I have recommended this book to all my friends and they have loved it as well now they come to me asking me what to read next. So just pick it up read it and I'm sure you will feel the same.
__label__2 First Rate: Jack Reacher is someone that one should never get on the bad side of. Great action.I kept wanting more and more.
__label__1 Meh...: Compared to "Holiday man" I didn't like this album.But I didn't give it too much of a chance before I sold my cd collection...
__label__2 Spence is a Hoot, Part Philosopher, Part MANIAC!!: Spence does a wonderful job of framing what it means to "win" an arguement. He makes an eloquent, I dare say nearly buddhist, arguement of his own for what it means to let go of the need to be right. Pounding others into submission is not always helpful during arguements. Rather it is the style (if not substance) of your arguements that win. Slow at times, but a nice read.
__label__2 Soothing Balm For The Wounded Soul: The last time I purchased a proper Olivia studio album was Soul Kiss in 1985. Her 2007 Body, Heart And Spirit tour featured only one or two songs from Grace And Gratitude, so I did not buy this until recently - where the clearance price prompted me to do so.Olivia is largely known for sexy pop rock (Physical) and country stuff (Have You Never Been Mellow?), so this new agey album was totally refreshing.Wistful, tender, slightly melancholic and optimistic - Grace And Gratitude will interest those who like Govi, Chris Spheeris and Windham Hill stuff.There is a re- released version called Grace And Gratitude Renewed which features reworked songs. Also available is a pink edition with two bonus tracks - new recordings of Physical and Magic.Olivia's intention is to heal the heart and help people connect with each other. Grace And Gratitude is indeed soothing balm for the wounded soul. Just close your eyes and relax.
__label__2 Angst saver!: Wonderful device....wish it had come with a full manual...had to download and print it from the Garmin website..a lot of pages and printing ink and paper.....it took some getting used to as to how to preview your intended route without going through the whole route in real time...and initially did not realize the arrow supposedly pointing north was pointing south...so all directions during the first tries were backwards!!!!!! Intuitively, I finally touched the arrow to correct its orientation and from then on, directions were correct. Once you get to know it and use it a few times, it is a wonderment!
__label__1 COMIC BOOK IS BETTER: Can ANYONE out there make a GOOD movie about this elite service of professionals?? I guess not. Don't waste your time or money with this dog!
__label__1 even Sharon Stone can't save this STINKER!: ...and she's a pretty lousy actress to begin with, but you'd think that with her looks this movie would be somewhat bearable.Nope, this has got to be one of the single DUMBEST movies I've ever seen. The plot is idiotic especially the ending, Sharon Stone has all of 2 or 3 rubber expressions on the whole time, the attempts at "steamy erotika" are a clumsy joke, both Stone and Baldwin phone in their high-school-drama-production performances...bleh!I was just glad that I rented not bought this total POS.
__label__1 NOT CR2032 Battery Lights: The lights seem fine, but beware, they call for 3 little batteries, not 1 CR2032. Since I already have a bunch of cr2032 batteries on hand I was hoping to use them up. Unfortunately, I'll be returning these and trying to get some that call for cr2032s.
__label__1 Steaming hot it's not!: I was disappointed in the steam machine. I expected it to do a great job and it only did a good job. I own and operate my own cleaning business and hoped that I'd be able to offer my customers another option. To my dismay it took too long to clean whatever I chose to try it on so that being said I returned my item for a full refund. I am going back to the old saying...if it looks too good to be true it probably is and this was!
__label__1 *****Dangerous Exploding Glass*****: The glass cover of my Anchor Hocking 2-quart casserole dish exploded in the microwave (please see photo). It made a very loud sound when the lid exploded; the glass broke up into uniform smallish pieces. When I stopped the microwave by opening the door just after the explosion, excessively hot glass rained down all over my stove, counters, floor, me, etc. I did not get physically injured by the glass, just scared to death! The microwave seems to be mostly unscathed and is still in working order. I've been using this dish for just over a year now, always in the microwave, I usually wash it by hand, but occasionally it gets washed in the dishwasher on the crystal/glass setting, no heat drying.I will not buy Anchor Hocking Glassware for cooking in the future.
__label__1 JBL -- Speakers BLOW (literally)!: I am sad to say that I agree with those who have commented on the speakers blowing out. I should have known, given that the store where I listened to the JBL system had the same problem---but they blamed it on the prior customer. I bought the JBL less than a month ago, and have used it rarely, but when I put my ipod in it today, the speakers blew (even though it wasn't even loud) and the volume control doesn't work anymore. Upon further review today, I've found that many others have had the same problem. This is my FIRST review ever, because I've never been so disappointed to write a review before. I loved it for the first two weeks, but I expect $150 speakers to last longer than that.
__label__2 Nikka kicks ASS!!!: ok people, pop this cd into your stereo and get ready to be blown away. Nikka is funky and workin it, taking us into musical bliss. I've read some reviews on here, please do not compare Nikka to Teena. No comparison. Nikka ROCKS! And her live shows are as good as it gets. If "cantneverdidnothin" doesnt get you movin, or "On and On", then you officially have no pulse. There is a good mix of songs, something for everybody, but I like when Nikka's rockin and wailing. My only complaint is there arent more songs! See her live people, it will change your world. (And if you want to hear her really belt it out, try to get a copy of "butterfly rocket", the cd before "every body got their somethin".) Anyway, definately buy it, if you like good music then you won't be disappointed! Nikka is hardly hype, and deserves whatever success she gets! Support her, or we'll be stuck in a world of posers and music samplers! :)
__label__1 Impossible to remove the seedlings from the system: I was a first time seedling grower when I used this product. But I found it too hard to remove the seedlings from the containers once they had grown. I would not use this system again.
__label__1 Awful: I usually don't leave negative reviews, but this book was so disappointing. There's no plot , no story,no emotion, main character war bland. Can't believe the author won the hugo and nebula for his other works. I'm told its autobiographical, the main character relives the author's experience thru the Vietnam war. I guess thats why it feels more like a documentary then a story. Ender's Game, Old mans war, starship troopers are so much better.
__label__1 Not so much: I didn't care for this one. The size runs small. It was a bit uncomfortable, so I ended up not using it and giving it away to a much smaller person.
__label__1 Table-Mate II Woodgrain Crap: Amazon.....please don't embarrass yourself by selling this product. It is so poorly constucted that I would hesitate to place anything on it. It's flimsy, it collapses at the slightest movement, and it is smaller than the prevoius Table Mate products. In fact, I am using an older model for my laptop on which I am writing at the moment. There is NO ..... I say again....NO comparison. My very first major disappointment from Amazon. Drop it.
__label__2 Father Goriot: A classic. Fine literature and a perennial favourite. A wonderful example of Realist fiction written by Balzac as part of his "La Comedie Humaine" and published in 1835. Set in Paris during the post Napleonic era, it is rich with description of the city, of family dynamics, and love, pain, greed and retribution. I rated it only **** because I prefer the translation by Burton Raffel in the Norton Critical Edition.
__label__1 Good cgi. If you like B SiFi movie's go for it.: Poor production quality and directing. Not much to the storey either. Toward the end of the movie a woman cop gets killed during a shootout with the robots and a few scenes later the same scene is used again. If you like the movies that the SiFi channel makes you will probably like this one. I had to fast forward through all the time wasting arguing scenes (a favorite way to fill time when there's an idea for a movie but no storey). I would say it could have been cut down to 30 minutes with the material they had to work with.
__label__1 OKAY PRODUCTION, GOOD LYRICS.: Sounds like rap/rock. I like some of the songs. I gave the CD to my cousin, though. I like Bobby Digital better.
__label__1 Not for Christians!!!: The title of this book is would have one believe that it is actually conversations with God. IT IS NOT! It is conversations with a god...the god of this world. It sounds great but is definitely not a Christian book and should DEFINITELY not be bought for your teen if you are a Christian.
__label__1 This Does NOT Include A Horse: This is very misleading!!!! The picture shows a horse with a rider. i received two of these today and was so disappointed to find only the rider with a saddle and blanket in the box!!! The rider was very small and so NOT worth the price of this product. They shouldn't be able to get away with advertising the product this way! Now I have the headache of returning this junk!
__label__2 Best album to date for Josh: I'd give this album more than 5 stars if I could. There's such a wonderful variety on this album, something for everyone. His voice is as incredible as always and the album is incredible from beginning to end. Run...don't walk to buy this one! My personal favorites are You are Love (Don't Give Up) and Machine--the keyboard by Herbie Hancock has a great funk groove to it. I have a feeling Josh is going to need add extra tour dates in for this album!
__label__2 Enthralling: This book was very good. It provided what it promised, and the selection of short stories was indeed great. My only problem with this book is its binding- if you want to keep it for a long time, don't get this edition, because the thing will fall apart in a couple of years.
__label__2 This book teaches more then just colors: This book is one of my favorites! First off it rhymes! Kids love that about the book! It flows nice and is easy to ready for the older kids. Plus the poem is a pleasure to listen to for the younger kids.It talks about colors while touching on diversity. It is a must have for the classroom or you own child's book shelf!
__label__2 An Excellent Read for the Gifted Student of Bugei: This is an excellent supplement to any and all of Lowry-san's writings on his experience in the martial arts. I discovered in it that the goju system I had studied, and in which I received dan status, was actually Shinkageryu. A fascinating series of forms and techniques lie within that which is presented. Study this well. A must addition to any serious student's library. It goes with Dr. Morris' Path Notes of an American Ninja Master and Dave Lowry's works. Get it, read it, *study* it.about it. -Toda Hayakko, The Black Tiger
__label__1 Poor formatting in Kindle version: I purchased the Kindle version and will not review the book for content as I have had some real issues trying to read it. The format is terrible! There are typos all over the place, misspellings, extraneous letters and other characters randomly inserted everywhere. Quotes are not clearly indicated so readers are not sure if they are reading a quote or the author's words. Indentation varies from paragraph to paragraph. Are these the preliminary galley proofs or the final text? The Kindle version is terrible and the publisher needs to clean it up. It is not worth the price in the current form. It is a difficult book to read because of all the format problems.
__label__2 What metal was meant to be!!!: "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!" is how any good metal album should start out and this one does just that. What follows is the quintessential metal album that all others should be measured against. The first song "Angel of Death" is a barrage of super fast tempo, shredding guitars and lyrics about.......,you guessed it, satan and death. Really, when it comes to speed metal, what else is there. In the bridge to the guitar solo in "Necrophobic" you hear Tom Araya growl "Enter to the realm of Satan!!!!" before a squealing, lightning fast guitar blasts you to pieces. Now that's quality music! This all leads up to the last and best song "Raining Blood". This song covers all the metal bases. It's slow, it's fast, it's got blistering solos and lyrics about death, blood , evil and of course, Satan. All in all the best damn heavy meatal album ever released.
__label__2 Wonderful book!: Excellent value for the buck. Great ideas for creating many things that don't require a large space, fancy or expensive equipment. With the use of your own creative powers, scrap fabrics and a little time you can have a small picture.
__label__2 Great summer shades!: These sunglasses look awesome and they come with a case, what a great deal. I love how they are darker than any other pair i have and they are quite sturdy. Delivery was very prompt.Thank you, Kendall Drive! I want a size small!
__label__2 How to keep a baseball card enthusiast happy!: I purchased this set of 500 cards for my grandson's 9th birthday. He said it was the best birthday present ever. He loves the stats on baseball players old and new and this collection had some of the great players such as Carl Yastremski, Roger Clements, and a lot of the old favorites. He has only gotten through the first 100 cards so far and even his Dad is excited about them and wants his own box. Guess who is getting what for Christmas!! What a fantastic present for such a reasonable price. I am now going over my birthday/Christmas list to see what boys I might send this collection to since it is the "greatest" gift ever according to my Jimmy!
__label__2 Superhero needs sidekick: This is the best hair styling product out there. It doesn't flake. But it gets even better... Just like Batman doesn't NEED Robin, this doesn't NEED the freeze spray. But it makes it even better. If you put this in, and then spray the freeze spray over it, it will get STIFF! You can sleep with this stuff in for three days and it'll still be up (it won't have the crunchiness of the first day though).If you want the best, get this and this:GOT 2B GLUED BLASTING FREEZE SPRAY 12oz (SCREAMING HOLD).
__label__2 Great book!: This book is great. It really meets life where it happens. It is down to earth and promotes a closeness with God.
__label__1 bad company: Order product they took money then sent email saying they didny have the product and now i cant get my money back
__label__2 Great Soundtrack but missing a song: A very good movie about 20 years olds revisiting each other for their high school reunion and the relationships they're in. The soundtrack is just as good but I have to correct one persons review that said all the songs in the movie can be found here. THIS IS NOT TRUE! It is missing a classic 80's one-hit wonder song: "I Ran (So Far Away) by A Flock Of Seagulls. I am not sure why this was left off the soundtrack as it's the only thing keeping it from being perfect and that is why I give the soundtrack 4 stars instead of 5.
__label__1 cheep: the backboard is warped from the start. the rim doesn't bolt up evenly, to make a true 90degree with the backboard. Ok for starters but don't have high expectations. For the money,... It's ok.
__label__2 A wonderfull set of images! Translations are very simple.: This book is basicly the biography of many alchemist's from that period. Each alchemist featured starts with a brief bio of him and then the images of his engravings. After that is translations of the latin on the engravins and an inerpretation.However, I must warn you that the translations from latin are very simple, they will say 'cook' when the word means 'cook by boiling down'. It is best to check any translations you wish to rely on. As for the authors interpretation's, that is strictly a matter of opinion.
__label__1 Tolkien wrote a good story: But these people do a truly lousy job of telling it. If you can't find a better version of audio book, just buy the bound version and read it instead.
__label__1 Don't waste yor time with this item: I had to give a 1 star review because zero was not an option. Product arrived very fast and was packaged well but it was DOA. The CD player would not work, it would not read any CD's right out of the box. I called the 800 customer serv # and was asked to get a cd cleaner and and clean the laser and if that did not fix it to return it. UPS delivered it yesterday and I sent it back today. Very cheap knobs and cheaply made overall. The radio did work but did not sound very well at higher volume, it would be good for maybe a nursery where the music is not loud.
__label__2 Great with salmon, on sandwiches, and in soups!: This is my favorite spice to put on fresh salmon. Back in 2004, we took a trip to the Oregon coast, and one night I grilled salmon fillets with this Cajun Creole seasoning, some garlic, Tillamook butter, salt, pepper, and just a tiny bit of lemon. We served it with pine nut cous-cous, grilled vegetables, and northern Italian bread . . . And my family still talks about the salmon to this day! Every summer they ask me to make it again - in fact, they have even offered to drive two hours to the coast to buy fresh salmon - if only I will agree to cook it.I also like to sprinkle this on sandwiches when I get tired of the same old thing. I usually put it together with oven-roasted turkey, provolone, lettuce, tomato, red onion, basil, oil, and a dash of vinaigrette. I've used Cajun Creole a few times for various soups, too. You would be surprised what it can do for homemade chicken soup (or waterhole soup for that matter).
__label__2 A fun little anime, not to be missed!: atthecon.com reviewed this anime. This was a fun little anime, not too deep, not too much fan service or slapstick. A lot of fun. If you like this type of genre then you will enjoy this anime. 4/5.
__label__2 GHETTO: This c.d. is tha best. Da second track has a good and loud beat. All da songs have good lyrics and some are funny.
__label__2 CD: I have been wanting this recording for a number of years. It is an excellent classic recording. The quality of the product was very good.
__label__1 Digital Horrors: I thought I was doing the right thing by getting the "remastered" version. The recording seems to encompass everything bad about digital recording. Harsh over prossessed, Joan's voice robbed of emotion and feeling. No I'm not an anolog only guy, 97% of all my music is on CD but I think I will try to find Diamonds and Rust on LP.
__label__1 BUYER BEWARE!!!!: This is a "miniture" book. A real disappointment if you are thinking it to be a normal size children's book. Amazon should have had a size disclaimer on this one and I should have read the reviews. I'm glad I only bought one copy. I had almost purchased several as gifts! Instead this is going in my stocking and I will now always inquire on size!!!!
__label__1 Ambitious though disappointing: I picked up this book expecting a look at the many facets of the U.S. military and law enforcement special operations and counter-terrorist community though was disappointed by the units ultimately selected. The narrative is weak and not very insightful. I cannot endorse this title.
__label__2 It's the only sandal my husband wears.: My husband's feet hurt all the time from sports injuries etc, Yucatan has the arch support and comfort he needs.This sandal is the only one he's worn for 10 years or so since he discovered it. He wears it walking even on the treadmill, since we live in Florida, sandals are our daily footwear.A few years ago ECCO had a demin color, like a navy blue, he would prefer that color.However, comfort first, color 2nd!
__label__2 Other..: This is an amazing album. If you regard music as a plane in which beauty should exist. This is an album. He uses the entire plane of music to create music with a purposeful melody and a necessity. I thoroughly enjoyed this piece of music. I highly recommend if you like beauty in music.
__label__1 Too much over-produced sugar: He's a good guitarist, vocals are getting better and the rest ????? If your going to play the blues it needs to come from the heart. Not some sugar coated producer in a recording studio. And get rid of the "Do Wa" girls in the background.
__label__2 So far, so good...: like I said so far so good. 3 minor things 1)tank holds less than 4 gallons 2)is kinda noisy 3) this sucker is heavy. We have only used it 2 weeks thus far if anything changes good or bad, I will update.
__label__1 BURN IT!: I found this CD to be a disgrace to mankind! I've never even heard it before but just by looking at Yanni on the cover, I can tell that it is totally bizarre and unheard of. I mean listen to Rage Against the Machine for crying out loud. Not this long haired freakazoid. Geez.
__label__2 classic bible: classic little bible since 1953 good for beginners. also got through amazon "art of the samurai" about japanese arms and armor 1156-1868 a catalogue from an exhibition from the MMA, beautiful photo's and worth it's price.
__label__2 Erotic, gory and gripping!: Great story from beginning to end. Well worth the time spent on it. Easy to follow if you have read the previous two; if not, don't even go there! Excellently written. It is nice to see that the other charcters get a look in and we start to learn more of them. There is also an introduction of some new characters which we are sure to meet again in the next books, Pandora being one of them. Akasha has great ideals and we can realise where she is coming from! It is also nice to learn more of the history of the vampire generations and we begin to understand them in more depth. So flawlessly written that we really can begin to believe in them!
__label__2 Solid, Clean, and Easy to mount. Built in level wasn't accurate.: + It was well packaged, undamaged, and delivered within a week.+ Clean, cheap ($), and solid.- Do not trust the built in level! Check with your own level before drilling any holes. Mine was off so I had to do the best I could to correct it after mounting it once.
__label__2 Great Book!: Honestly, this is the best book I've ever read onself-confidence.It really helps and doesn't waste your time by uselesstalking. Each chapter takes around 15 minutes to read butI think exercises take some more time.I'm going to read it again and again, many helpful lessonsare there.
__label__1 Boring: This book is borderline awful. Unrealistic characters, predictable beyond belief, and not compelling at all. The preview may look ok, but it is downhill from there. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Grind your own sausage or ground meat.: With a KitchenAid Mixer, you can grind your own meat for sausage, or anything you need. Keep clean and take care of it, and it will last a lifetime.
__label__2 Shadow Syndromes explains so much!: I read this book because our child had just been diagnosed with one of the "Shadow Syndromes," Asperger Disorder. As so often happens with childhood-onset brain disorders, he has symptoms that are a mixture of various disorders -- major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder. (These are hereditary disorders when appearing in one so young.) After reading this book, so many elements of our son's puzzling behavior, and the milder symptoms present in my husband and myself are more understandable. If you or your loved ones have mild forms of more serious brain disorders, this book is for you. I had an "aha" experience at every chapter. Our policy is not to buy any book unless we have already read a copy from the library and know that we will refer to it again and again -- that it is truly useful. This book fits that criterion. Read it.
__label__2 The CD of the 90's: I feel reluctent to jump on any band wagons, but I must agree that Nirvana's 'Nevermind' is one of the greatest CDs ever made. It has had a profound impact on the rock music of the entire decade that no one can honestly deny and call themselves a rock fan. The first side (I have this album on tape) is one solid pack of hit songs, something that few bands can boast of. Not only where they all released and made the charts, but a decade after their release they are still played non-stop (has anyone heard 'Losing a Whole Year on the Radio' lately?).For those who violently hate the radio with a bitter passion the second side is true Nirvana with an excellent show of guitar work and what I assume are stunning lyrics ;)Of note: 'Lithium', well heck everything
__label__2 shipping: I didn't expect my book can be shipped in such a short time!!it's nice to receive the book in such a good condition too. I will definitely continue to purchase in Amazon if necessary.
__label__1 BORING!: This game has no obstacles! It wears out your thumbs. You need a good memory to remember all the tricks.The few good things about it are, it has a training camp and it is long.Don't buy this game unless you have a good memory, have tough thumbs and you don't like obstacles.
__label__2 This Joint is Phat like Swine Grease!!!!: All the songs on this album are hot? who care if it's house D&B or Acid or "F"--in Lounge Music it all connects, it's all Funky Just open up your ears. The elements of each song cross genres, so to all of you so call purest, eat mud. Yo! this CD is a classic! It will get any party started. The joint by King Kooba –“ Fooling Myself”- is My Favorite. The Beats alone on this joint are so NICE!! I WISH I COULD BOOST(borrow,steal,etc.) THEM!! They would make some wicked hip-hop beats!! You see i dont only buy the artists, when i buy music i buy the production team and the label. If it's Om (buy it!!) if it's Compost (boost that #$@#) I love imports but they cost too much , but they can super hot or super "doo do" though. We need more Labels like OM to put out quality stuff like OM Lounge, Vol. 4~ Various Artists. Peace to all the Acid Labels!!!! Peace to all the Fans!!! Keep it Comin!!!
__label__2 Easily the greatest black comedy EVER made!: Two planes having sexual intercourse to the song "Have a little tenderness". A psychotic general launching a nuclear attack on Russia because he thinks there is a communist conspiracy to poison his drinking water, endangering his "precious bodily fluids". The conflict with the coke machine. The hand with a mind of it's own. The phone conversation with the Soviet premier. Dr. Strangelove learnig how to walk. The line of dialogue "Mien Furher". All these things make this one of the greatest movies ever made. But it's the sight of the world ending set to the WWII teerjerker "We'll meet again" that let's us know we are in the hands of the greatest director in cinema history.
__label__2 Good product!: Used this to make some homemade applesauce. The product itself was great, and worked just like my mom's vintage one. I gave it 4 stars because I couldn't find a bowl to fit underneath the cone. The legs sit at a weird diameter, so I had a difficult time working with it.
__label__1 This Software isn't compatible with Mac OS10.4.4 (Tiger): Save your money if you're running Mac OS 1.0.4.4 (Tiger) -- it crashes when you try to print. There's no technical support provided.This is useless.
__label__1 Interestingly probative; woefully incomplete: Let me first say that I enjoyed reading this book. It helped me better understand both music and neuroscience. Music's influence on us is a fascinating and powerful subject.That having been said, however, I do need to make at least one criticism. Levitin's evolutionary explanation for the development of music is egregiously one-sided. He suggests, with others, that music may be an outward demonstration of intelligence and physical prowess - look at me, I can afford to waste all this time and energy - akin to the male peacock's tail. THIS IS ALL WELL AND GOOD FOR MALES, BUT WHAT ABOUT FEMALES!? I read not one sentence in Levitin's book explaining what evolutionary theory would have to say about female singing. I'm willing to accept adaptive explanations for many things.. but in this case Levitin does little to ward off the inevitable criticism that his book features a number of very half-based "just so" stories.
__label__2 An intellectual feast - Bruce, Ben and a Big Rock: Not every sci-fi movie is able to incorporate mankinds desire for self-preservation with the blossoming of youth and young love. It is a metaphorical battle between the established way (represented by Bruce Willis) and the genesis of a rebellious new order (represented by the romantic interest - Ben and Jennifer). The rock represents the divisions between these two ideals and in itself is an idealistic revisionistic portrayal of natures ambivalence. It is amazing that the writers and directors were so carefully able to weave this subtle message into such an action packed, spine-chilling, visually astheatic, think piece. Well done chaps!
__label__1 Garbage: I happened to consult the Amazon reviews on this product only after I had purchased it in a store. I was rather dismayed to see the reviews, but I was hopeful that mine would be ok. For 4 months it worked great, though even when working it has a couple annoying features: the ink level monitors in no way reflect the actual amount of ink in the tanks, and it prints papers face-up starting with page one, so your document is completely backwards when you are done printing. Nevertheless it was working.But in the end my hopes were dashed. After 4 months, the black ink prints with large streaks through it, even with a brand new ink cartridge. The ink cartridge head-cleaning exercise does nothing. Argh!I only hope that you are reading this *before* buying this product!
__label__2 This electric blower is everything I expected (& maybe more): This is my first real blower/vac. I had a used gas powered one which I paid $40 to have repaired and then it only lasted 3-4 weeks. This time 'round, I opted for electric based on the price and future maintenance free performance. I love the metal blades, as I'm never fearful of vacuuming up something that I shouldn't, as well as the infinite speed control. I suspect there may be some gas blowers that are more powerful and offer freedom of mobility (which is the only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars), but I can't imagine an electric blower getting any better.Addendum: It is now November 2012, 5 years since I purchased this item. It is getting louder and sounds as if it may die soon, but it is still performing admirably. When it does die, I will replace it with another Toro electric blower/vac.
__label__1 frustrating phones: I would not recommend these phones. They beep and turn off constantly. I can only guess it is because I have wireless internet in my house. The wireless internet is not connected to the same phone line that these phones are connected to so that should not be why. The only reason I have not returned the phones is because my children threw away the box.
__label__1 underworld: I liked the fact of having in my possession the entire collection of Underworld but I welcome the know or learn that when tested the first movie of this saga was not spoken in Spanish or at least its subtitle and is entirely in English and other languages and not one that I could understand at least
__label__2 The American Prophecies: This is the book to read for information about where the United States is in biblical prophecy. Timely and very informative.
__label__2 Weird AL, Yesterday, Today and Some time in the near Future.: Well what can i say? Another master piece? Sure. Mostly what I enjoyed is the fact that after fifteen years Al parodies new songs in the same old "Al" way. Al got "FLY For A Rabbi" or any one for that matter. Weird Al is a Christian too! I had no idea til recently! Well God Bless You Weird Al Yankovic! I grew up with you since I was 10. Praise the Lord for creating such a splended talent!
__label__1 Amazon: Please don't categorize this book as "Jewish": Dear Amazon:This is not a "Jewish" book. It is offensive and pointless for you to categorize it under Judaism.This is a book by and for Chr*stians, to provide them with ammunition for converting Jews.Please recategorize this book under Chr*stianity.
__label__1 NOT AS FUNNY AS BILLED. AND ALMOST NO ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: I wish that I could write a really long review on this but I really didn't like it. It;s basically the same as project A except with limited action, stupid comedy, and a final fight scene that doesn't dissapoint because IT'S THE ONLY FREAKING ONE. The weird soccer game was pretty enjoyable, and the whole gun thing was very funny, but a major letdown overall.
__label__1 High Hopes go belly up: I've heard detailed descriptions of Mr. Bohm's theory before ordering the book. At first....it was Very exciting to start delving into Mr. Bohm's incredible work.But halfway through the book....it was painfully obvious how poorly written this book is!!....Hard to follow..Shabby consistency....NOT friendly reading.I Still have the upmost respect for Mr. Bohm's theory of the implicate/explicate order...just wish this book was written clearly...could have been a facinating exploration.Instead...was a frustrating trip.Too bad....again....Much respect for Mr. Bohm....this book misses the mark though..
__label__2 Jonathan Franzen is a genius of a writer!: I love this guy's writing. He's quirky, and can I say "brilliant"? I really enjoy his writing and his approach to story-telling. This book may not be for everyone. See if you can read inside a bit to see if it's for you.
__label__2 good game: This is a good game, but I wish I had bought the original version. It was easier to follow. I liked it better.
__label__2 Counter attack boredom: I absolutely love this season, I bought season 1-4 because in my opinion those are the only ones worth having. It is my belief that after season 5 the series went down.
__label__1 Cashing in on the ignorance of Irish-Americans: If you are not Irish you might enjoy this book, but for anyone who is actually from Ireland or in touch with Irish culture this book reads like a bit of a sham. My wife is Irish born and so were my parents, and we picked this book up for our wedding. I wish we had read through it a bit more before we got it. It was of no use to us as we knew that most of the customs in it either weren't for real or would be laughed at by our Irish relations attending the wedding. Yes there are some old time customs listed in it...are they practical or "Irish"? We did not find them so. If you are a New Ager or have a fantasy view of Irish culture this book might work for you, but otherwise, save your money for the wedding.
__label__1 Much ado about less than nothing: The author seems to imagine that the tiny, tiny, tiny handful of feminists who hold anti-male views somehow weild enormous power. She ignores real threats to both women and men, prefering to concentrate on a powerless group with fewer adherents than the Jews for Hitler League. She thinks that "passionate rejection of men" is the one thing that unifies feminists, and from such an absurd statement, one can not possibly take seriously anything else she says. She also seems to assume that "heterophobia" is some kind of looming menace, which is preposterous and insulting that any thoughtful person.
__label__2 Very enjoyable gallop!: Champion of Justice was a very enjoyable light novel. I love time travel and alternative history fiction, so this was right up my alley. You don't always know what you're getting with a small press publication, but Frederic James has written very transparent prose with very believable main characters. I appreciated the tributes to a classic radio and screen westerm hero, the masked rider of the plains and his faithful native American sidenudge. I'd love to see more.Heigh-ho Sliver!
__label__1 TurboTax = Reload Operating system: I've used TT for several years and though somewhat buggy; I've been able to work my way through the problems. I have rental properties and have to fill out several schedules.TT never correctly calculates "Credit to Other Taxing Juristdictions"; I usually end up forcing the correct entries in the Forms view. If you have this credit; you also can't file your state return electronically.For 2001, TT insistence on loading their version of IE 5.5 gave me grief from the start. One touch updates and downloads of the State product left me on the phone for hours. Finally the tech emailed me an external link to download from. It so screwed up my system that I ended up reformatting my hard disk and reloading all my programs.Like at tax time I needed another headache!
__label__2 Challenged my Beliefs: What a unique expression. I really appreciate how Mystic Life organized his thoughts and influenced mine. Love the cover, too. I am in the midst of a significant personal exploration that involves my spirituality and my sexuality. Spiritual Polyamory has helped me tremendously in my process!
__label__1 Meh...: This is the worst soundtrack to date from the Tony Hawk games.The cover's pretty cool (The Clash rock).The music is uber-lame.
__label__2 Like new: Very good book. Looks like new and at a really good price. We paid $120.00 for another math book and it didn' have a cover. I am very pleased.
__label__1 Not for me...: I was very disappointed in this book. I was looking for a resource to help educate me on the physiological and health impacts of drinking alcohol - mainly so I could improve my fitness and lose weight. This book is a collection of the author's personal stories and opinions on why one should stop drinking and it offers suggestions on how to view the problem with alcohol abuse so people will hopefully quit drinking.There is very little, if any, scientific evidence or data provided in this book. Maybe that's good for some people but I'm looking for facts, not fluffy, motivational pep-talks.
__label__1 Super small: Quality is great, but really, the size is just ridiculously small. Regret having paid this much and will look elesewhere for my Waldorf-inspired dolls in the future.
__label__1 $6.18 plus $9.45 shipping for one 32 oz box???: Seriously?? This is a wonderful product; I am completely hooked. Of all of the non-dairy milk drinks I have tried, this is by far my favorite. I was hoping to find it cheaper by the case as it is $2.69 per box at my local co-op. Please, for goodness sake do not pay this much! You can find this product at [...] and [...] for much cheaper than this Amazon offer.
__label__2 Somewhere in the Darkness: Somewhere in the darkness is a great book. I had picked it up to read as a class assignment thinking it was going to be a boring story, because I hadn't seen the title or the back cover of the book telling me what it was about. But when I started reading it, I found that it wasn't such a bad book, and that it was a wonderfully written with a great theme and a great plot. I could relate to this book in many ways and I know people that could also relate to this book. It was a book that was easy to understand, and easy to picture mentally, and I'm glad I chose this book to read. I would recomend it book to anyone that wants a book with a main character they can relate to emotionally.
__label__2 More essential paleo-conservative reading: Along with the American Conservative, Chronicles is one the highlights of my month. While AC is more "newsy", Chronicles, as its byline states, deals more with heavier, cultural issues. Many of the writers seem to be refugees from the leftist takeover at National Review. The viewpoint is pro-Catholic, pro-Southern (US) and pro-Western. There is a narrower idealogical focus to Chronicles than in AC, with more of a religous slant than I personally care for. Still, there is so much solid reporting and commentary here that I will be subscribing for a long time to come.
__label__1 Movie Yes, Soundtrack No: Sorry Samuel, the movie "Black Snake Moan" was good, but the soundtrack not so good.
__label__2 Heh. . I know this guy :): I've had Dr. Detmer as an advisor at MTSU here for three years. He is one of the finest minds on the subject of the assembly language , and has used this book for years. (Yes, he actually is one of those professors that printed his own book for awhile and handed it out.) I could be really mean here.. but .. then again.. he could recommend I take some impossible course, so I won't. This is a great teacher, and his book follows suit.
__label__2 Great time keeper: I purchased this watch as a keeper. I wear it all of the time and it is the best at keeping time. I had to replace the battery 1 month after I bought it. Since battery replacement, it has kept great time......down to the second. Invicta is a great time keeper and that is why I bought it. Problem is the ink has come off of the bezel.... but don't let that chase you away..... it is a great watch. I chop wood, fight crime and swim underwater with it..... I can count on it and rely on it.
__label__2 Great Buy: I work in the legal department and i'm in school for a paralegal degree. This book came in excellent condition and is easy to use, thus far containing all of the words I looked up. It also arrived earlier than expected. Great buy!
__label__1 (Mostly) bland euro-pop: Essentially, this is the soundtrack to the film "Highlander" and provides a few strong tracks."Who Wants To Live Forever" may very well be Queen's most emotional song.This album becomes the first not to achieve an award for sales. It is deemed too "Euro-pop" to be a success in America.This had to have been true as this same album became a huge success through out the entire world and one if it's singles (the very pop "A Kind Of Magic") was a number 1 hit in over 35 countries!Sadly, this album contained too much pop oriented music for even my own taste and in doing so, is one of my least favorite records of theirs.At least the album's cover is fun and imaginative.
__label__2 Pricey but works well: I consider this product expensive but bought it anyway. Although I am not exactly sure how this product is "oil free" with "essential oils of ylang ylang," etc. as part of the ingredients, it works well and I would buy it again. It feels like a very light cream as opposed to the watery oil free moisturizers I have used before. This moisturizer also offers matte protection. I have oily skin, but at the end of the day my skin was not shiney as with other products. The little 2 oz. jar lasted me about 6 months with 1 time daily use. It would be even better if it were SPF 15.
__label__2 Maroon 5 is off to a good start: I got interested in Songs About Jane when I first heard track #2 (This Love) on the radio, and especially when I heard track#1 (Harder To Breathe) on the radio, which may be my absolute favorite song. All of the tunes on Songs About Jane speak something about love relationships, but aren't restricted to calm ballad-like melodies. Most of the songs are filled with lively guitar and percussion patterns, and display the lyrics in a way that progresses smoothly. Maroon 5 is already becoming a well-known band, and if you try listening to Songs About Jane you'll soon know why.I recommend:Harder To BreatheThis LoveShe Will Be LovedShiverTangledThrough With You
__label__1 If you like distorted 78 rpm records this is for you: I am shocked at all the 5 star ratings. True these are fine voices but a disaster recording outdoors. Poor lighting, no staging, poor recording, blurry cinematography, wind noise, orchestra about a mile away. Opera is a visual and auditory experience. This recording was a failure and I have to agree with the reviewer who called this a Neolithic recording....what a waste. Why did they not bring this fine cast in the studio and record them?...and now they are lost forever...this was as much a failure if not worse then the first Met telecast of La Boheme with Pavarotti and Scotto. Now I have to search for a better Norma even if I don't get Caballe. I will never buy another outdoor recording. Fortunately I found 3 better recordings of la Bahome then the First Met performance.
__label__2 What The?: I have no idea how "Media Matters" has the authority to tell what is true or false. If it goes along with the left wing agenda they say it. If it does not they withhold the information. So that said "Media Matters" has not authority to say anything. This is a great book, which shows the side of Hillary Clinton that never gets seen.
__label__1 NEVER ORDER FROM OLD GLORY: I requested verification of delivery three times via email. None of my emails were responded to forcing me to file a claim with Amazon.com. I will NEVER order anything from Old Glory again.
__label__1 Bad Kindle Edition: My rating and review reflect the Kindle edition, not Euripides' plays, nor the translations and commentaries of these works. THE TROJAN WOMEN AND OTHER PLAYS is a horrible Kindle edition. The text of the plays does not act as text, but like a picture. The reader cannot change the text size (which is small), nor does the dictionary function work. Nor are there links to the notes. The reader must put in the location number of the notes in order to go there. (It would be much more helpful if for these Kindle editions editors would do footnotes instead of endnotes.) I read the sample before I bought the edition, but it was deceiving since it only covered the Introduction, which behaves like normal Kindle text. Were this one of the relatively inexpensive editions, I would not be bothered by the poor Kindle features. But since this book was almost at full Kindle price, I expected much, much better.
__label__1 Too basic: Very basic. Lacks real instruction and certainly not an "Encylopedia of Pastel Techniques". A waste of my money.
__label__2 Great Value: I was a little leary about buying this, because the pictures make it look a little flimsy, but I was very pleased to find that it is quite heavy and rugged. Took me less then 10 minutes to have it set up and cutting perfect miters on my xacta saw. Since it comes with the bar and stop it is a great value. (...)
__label__2 Author did his homework: This is a very well written and very well researched book. I was very much drawn into the story from the beginning of the book until the last page. Burrough did in depth interviews with about everyone associated with the program and conveys his interviews into a cohesive, interesting and very intriguing story . . . it was hard to put down!
__label__1 No space to write: The photos are lovely, but I wouldn't have bought this calendar had I realized that most of the date boxes are filled with (rather pedestrian) travel tips, leaving no room to write down appointments, theater and music performances, birthdays, etc. The calendar description should make clear that Romantic Europe is strictly for gazing, not for notating.
__label__2 I needed framing nails - but not 5,000 of them: I went to my local super store to buy some framing nails for a project, but I didn't need 5,000 of them. I needed about 300 nails so my extensive search lead me to this product. The nails were the right ones for my gun, the price was reasonable, and I received them in 2 days. Thanks Amazon!
__label__2 Very useful and cute!: I love this chiller. It really works and the cute designs brightens up any table or party. It's multi-functional as well. Throw it in your lunch pack or a small cooler and it keeps the contents cold without the mess of ice. This is really a great buy.
__label__1 Do not trust this company: False advertising. Apparently, "plates," really means "plate." I was really excited about finding such a good deal on bumper plates until I received one plate in the mail. Buying an actual set of plates from this vender will run you about $80 including shipping; there are better deals out there- not to mention venders with more integrity.
__label__1 Total waste of time, ninja boloney!: Do not waste your time on this book, there might be *some* lessons to be learnt here, but they are few and far apart. Whatever philosophical meaning millman intended to impart is lost between senseless dialogues and beat about the bush writing style.I would give it no star if i could.I found "Tuesdays with Morrie" a much much better read for lessons in life.
__label__1 Twice defective: I purchased the item in spring 2011 at Amazon. The primary DVD ended up being defective and wouldn't play, even after repeated cleanings. So we tried purchasing another one (from a different Amazon seller), but this one also turned out to be defective. So we got rid of our Insignia player and purchased a new Panasonic player. Both discs fail to play in the new player. The video is garbled throughout substantial portions of each of the discs (though in different locations). I give up. Where's the manufacturing quality control for these Disney discs? It seems very odd for this to be a mere coincidence. Can't blame the sellers. Very disappointed.
__label__1 the unbearable lightness of being......: this book is one of the most lightweighted, unintelligent and meaningless books targeted toward gay readers I have ever come across. The writers hopeless attempt to be a sort of funny, but still real advisor in nearly embarrising to witness. Its so full of cliches and useless nonsense that anyone, in or out of the closet, rich or poor, better save their time -AND MONEY.
__label__1 Lid not staying on: Everything you have read about the lid not staying on this model is absolutely true. I bought it at Kroger on a whim before reading the reviews. After trying it out at home, I immediately noticed that the lid did not stay on --even before I tried filling the pitcher up with water! Note that one reader has suggested a rubber band solution, but why use a rubber band for a brand new product that is not that cheap? Personally, I would rather not buy it in the first place. There are other models that dont have the same problem.
__label__2 Saint Ralph is a Winner: too bad this indie flick didn't catch on in the main stream. It's great. We laughed out loud -- a lot! Heartwarming, witty .... etc.
__label__1 Horrible Movie, avoid at all cost!: This was absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen! BORING doesnt even describe it. The Sabertooth Tiger you see on the cover and in all the previews is in maybe....5 minutes of the movie. 75% of the movie is this guy walking around lost... "Whats the point"??? I like Roland Emerick's other movies but this was BAD! First movie I have EVER "walked out" on.
__label__2 How old is Robert Jordan?: the question is, will he eventually bring this series to a conclusion before he leaves this life, or more importantly, before I do - I'm pushing 60 years of age and realize I'll never know 'how it all comes out' in the 'real world', will I suffer the same result with this series? You do realize authors have passed on before completing a series, is that our fate in this case?
__label__2 Zen in a DVD case: Survive Style 5+ has the feel the feel of a underground zine (perhaps from more of an 80s/90s zine scene, with its tendency towards novel bright fluorescent paper [mimicked by the bright pop style of movie,]) constantly playing with the absurd and still, through its semi-cohesive, semi-chaotic and yet allegorical plotline, it's able to be so much more.This is not a 'pop' work, this is a philosophical work. Or, maybe, it's really one in the same. Fans of this movie may be attracted to the sight of arms shooting off of beautiful women like rockets, over-dramatic Japanese prattle, and the bright flashy sets (not to mention the ever wonderful presence of Vinnie Jones,) but hopefully they're leaving with a slightly heightened sense of what entertained them. This film truly crosses from the absurd to become absurdist, with all the heightened feelings that conveys.Plus, Todanobu Asano is really, really just astoundingly hot in this movie.
__label__2 Low brow comedy performed at the highest level.: No one ever worked harder for laughs than the stooges. We'll never see anything like this act again. Thank you Columbia/Sony for restoring these shorts. These are the cleanest transfers yet. They look like they came directly from the original negatives. Like many other reviewers, I hope our friend Shemp is included in future releases.
__label__2 Fantastic Product: This product will solve any problem one has with a sliding glass door that sticks. The door now slides easily on its track.
__label__1 Don't buy it!!!!!!: This vacuum SUCKS, but not the way it's supposed to. You're better off picking the dirt off your carpet by hand!!!!
__label__2 Woo Hoo!!: Season 3 was amazing and I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to release!! Please don't leave us hanging! This is an amazing show and there is no reason it shouldn't be on DVD!! :]
__label__1 disappointing photos: I love the movie, Moulin Rouge is (at the moment) my favorite movie of all time. I am glad to have this book, but the pictures are very poor, almost all too dark, compare poorly to the DVD. Many others are way too small, there's a fair amount of blank space in this book. If you have the DVD, the bonus material covers most of what is in the book (on Disk 2). When I read a previous review that said "The pictures are bright and beautiful" I actually went back and flipped through the book again... virtually all the pictures from the actual movie are way too dark, the shots during production are OK, and the red print on black background is unreadable (illegible). So I'd advise you review a copy before purchasing.
__label__2 This is a work of art: From beginning to end this book had me hooked. Now this is the first R.A. Salvatore book ive read that pertains to Drizzt. This is an amazing book. R.A. Salvatore is truly the master of battle. He can paint a vivid picture in your mind. Its a great buy and I encourage any one to read this book.
__label__1 Won't Work: I couldn't get this remote to work with my Westinghouse LTV-30W2. I bought it when my dog chewed up the original remote. This is a common TV with codes listed in the remote's instructions. But the codes listed don't work with the remote. I never should have bought this remote. This remote represents a $30 loss to me. I do not recommend Universal products.
__label__1 boring: I really thought this would be well written, but it failed miserably. Plodding, predictable. I like other J.R. Ward stuff but this was bad.
__label__2 brilliant narrator: Absence of comment on work of the narrator, Jonathan Cecil, is puzzling. His performance is absolutely spot-on. The combination of Woodhouse's nascent genius and Cecil's brilliance make this one of the most enjoyable audiobooks I have ever listened to.
__label__2 Big hit!: This was given as a gift to my father. He and I have always listened to the Righteous Brother's from as far back as I can remember and when he opened this present he was absolutely delighted. He sings to it all the time!
__label__2 Useful guide to IBD and diet: In this book, Dr. Scala, a leading nutiritionist, provides diet and nutrition information so that people with IBD can help themselves find relief and achieve better health. The author has designed a drug free food and lifestyle program which includes: developing a personal testing program to identify foods that aggravate, cause or relieve flare-ups; "safe foods" and tips on reading labels; total fitness and stress reduction techniques; food allergies (including lactose, alcohol, and sugar intolerance); IBD and children; and recommended vitamin supplements. Recommended for folks who need clear instructions to develop their own dietary program. A useful book
__label__2 Great Deal: Great deal on a new cartridge. It works as advertised and was delivered promply.This was for my church copier.It is used for the church bullitins.
__label__2 A Cross between Forrest Gump and The Notebook: This film lasts almost 3 hours, and the premise is neither plausible nor well justified. Nonetheless it is fast-paced, entertaining and emotionally and intellectually stimulating, and it kept my complete attention throughout. Capable of provoking both laughter and tears, but a heavy movie with more sadness than joy. Not recommended as a feel-good movie, but recommended as a thought-provoking entertainment and/or stimulator of conversation. If you liked Forrest Gump and The Notebook, you'll like this film, and Brad Pitt is great in it!
__label__1 Quality seems good, but it didn't "work": Purchased this (as well as black cohosh) at the recommendation of a doula and several other holistically inclined momma types in order to give mother nature a nudge. Unfortunately it did not work and after several weeks I resorted to surgery anyway.
__label__2 Ally McBeal Season 5: Loved all 5 seasons. Wish there were 5 more. I felt as though I was saying goodbye to a bunch of old friends.
__label__1 Static, okay in small part of the house: This phone has terrible static in most places regardless of channelchange. It also had many dead spots. Okay near the base. Whyget a cordless phone??? Okay we do have wireless internet,but the more expensive 5.8GHz is not suppose to interfere with this.Worst cordless phone I ever purchased. In fact, soon to be returned!
__label__1 I couldn't connect with the heros: ***spoiler warning*** I couldn't really like Marcus because he was behaving like a... hm, well, should I say like a spoiled child for the first part of the book? He insulted everyone in sight, made totally inappropriate remarks, and then went on fuming about how nobody liked him. Well, that's a surprise. Try being nice to someone for a change. Then he made a 180 turn, completely changed his appearance and his behavior and voila, he was the toast of the ton. Meanwhile Regina (I really don't like this name) was just not that interesting a character. Her dyslexia overshadowed everything else about her. Then the way they kissed and groped each other at every opportunity. And the sudden decision that they will marry. Blah. Just not believable. I don't really think anything could work between them.
__label__1 OK for Cable not for SNET DSL: I cannnot get router to work with SNET DSL. Linksys NEVER NEVER EVER answers the phone. If I ever have to buy a DSL router again, I will buy something else.
__label__1 Not very informative: No one in my class liked this text. If you knew nothing about disaster mental health topics than it may be helpful.
__label__1 I Can't Believe I Actually Used To WATCH This: "Yu-Gi-Oh" used to be the biggest thing at my old school for an incredible period of time. I remember when I saw the show, I thought it rocked. Then, when I was no longer blinded with the well known craze faze, I relized how crappy it was. CARDS are the ultimate battle weapons? Crap.
__label__1 Tried to get into it, but....: I bought this CD back in '96 when I saw the video for "Novocaine for the Soul". I listened to the rest of the album back then and found it pretty boring. Recently, I found it again and decided to give it another try...A lot of people say that this is the kind of album that "grows on you". Because of that, I decided to drop it into my CD changer and listen to it several times. I did and it actually failed to grab me at all. I still love "Novocain for the Soul" but the other songs simply sound pretty boring to me...One word review: BORING!
__label__1 The Absolute Worst Movie I Ever Saw: This is a horrible tale about a girl named Hannah. The movie sucked so badly i fell asleep.
__label__1 Shoiuld be entitled, "Diary of a Depraved Call Girl": I intended to buy "Belle de Jour," a fictional book that was written years ago about a married prostitute in France, but decided to read the newer, London based account since I bought it (in error) and paid for it anyway. This is an apparently true account by a depraved London hooker, and I feel that this book has absolutely no redeeming social value. I'm no prude, but I wouldn't want to find myself anywhere near this woman.
__label__2 Brilliant Solo Debut: Few artists have stretched the boundries of recorded media with such integrity as Peter Gabriel. Bob Ezrin lends his distinctive touch to this Floyd-like production. Gabriel successfully delves into styles ranging from barbershop quartet (Excuse Me) to the nearly anthem-esque (Here Comes the Flood). If you haven't heard this, folks, you owe it to yourselves to pick up a copy. It has to be among the greatest solo efforts ever recorded.
__label__2 this novel rocked!: I loved this book from start to finish. In fact I was desperately hoping there would be a sequel and was excited to learn there is one coming out: Once Upon A Time In Stilettos...the novel is quirky, cute & original. In fact it would also make a great movie!If you like magic in an adult harry potter way you'll love this book.
__label__1 Brilliant poem, horrible translation: The Duino Elegies is one of the most breathtaking turns of 20th-century poetry (I don't want to say "great" or "canonical" here) but it has suffered a long history of bad translations into English that push the agendas of translators over faithfulness to the text. You're better off finding an early translation than picking this up, at least until a (good) poet takes the project on--Jerome Rothenberg, where are you when we need you?
__label__1 A few good insights: I hate to not rave about this, because the author seems like a great teacher and observer of children, but as a parent looking to understand the reasons why my son might be interested in violence I didn't finish the book with much more than a few good insights scattered throughout the book (mainly coming from an older child she talked to.)I found the detailed conversations of the kids to go on for way too long and ended up scanning trying to find her thoughts and observations.I loved the way she lead the kids in her class to make their own rules for violent games and I may use some of that myself with my son, but I can see it being more helpful for a teacher than a parent.Also, the focus on violent media was mostly about bloody scary/horror movies and didn't address cartoon violence or video-game violence. So I DID learn to avoid the blatantly scary movies (which most parents probably would anyhow) but I didn't learn much about the impact of other media.
__label__2 Good quality mower: Good mower...cuts great.....just don't let the grass grow too high, as this mower struggles with that.
__label__2 The New Sensation: This cd is going to shake the world up. They've already started their party, and people are happily joining the fresh, crunk rock, fun. Lead singer, aka, Slow Glow Activatur, said, "What we're really trying to do is just be open to everybody and show Christ-like love instead of trying to condemn anybody or anything." Family Force 5 was featured in CCM magazine for winning every award possible for 2007. CCM said, "...This year, they dominated-the band was your pick for, well, e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g." Teens and young adults are going to appreciate this the most - buy it. DON'T let one or two negative reviews hold you back. They're the new sensation. Don't miss out on the party!
__label__1 Good information for beginners, photography just ok: This book has good info for beginners. The photography is just mediocre though. I woudl have preferred more inspirational and dynamic photographs in this book
__label__2 Garfield 2 - A Tail of two Kitties: Great movie for Garfield and/or Bill Murray fans. Okay for the kids to watch and there is a lot of humor that is intended for the adult audience. Overall I consider it well worth the money and time to watch.
__label__2 SLOW SHIPPING!!!: This thing took a MONTH to get...Id go to the store and pay Extra...They said 3 days not 4 weeks!
__label__2 Great Product: This is an outstanding machine it removes layers of wallpaper with ease. This product will help increase my profit margins, and ultimately expand growth in my business.Thank You for a great product warner, and for great all around customer service amazon.com.Always a customer! Matt
__label__1 Sorry Guys.............: Sorry guys but this is a POS......Sorry I bought it....No reflection on the seller or Amazon...They are both great...Canon needs to revise the design!!!!
__label__1 NYC book lover: Like many who were critical of this book, I truly did want to love it. However, the writing was simple and flat, the characters lacked depth or conviction and the ending was a huge let down. Jacob was infuriating as he claimed to love these animals and then becomes sexually sidetracked while his Rosie was being beaten half to death. It made me sick to my stomach. Over and over, he continued to behave like a helpless child while this animal was brutalized. Time and again, he is either incredibly violent or he is impotent and seemingly defenseless. In the end, each conflict is suddently and hastily resolved with little authenticity. What a shame as this could have been a deeply moving and engaging story.
__label__2 leaf blower for my deck: love it - don't need my husband to blow the deck off or front steps - even my 5 year old son can handle it!
__label__1 SQL From the Ground Up barely gets off the ground: The book really deserve zero stars. The main theme of this book is ERRORS. The book also has poor explanations. Personal Oracle 8 takes about 8 hours to download if all you have is a 56k modem. I cancelled the download when I saw that it was going to take that long. This was around page 100 and at which time I decided to give up on the book and put it on sale and sold it for 10 bucks. I considered myself lucky. I thought it was going to serve me as a nice review, but that was a bad idea. I should have stuck to my copy of Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 24 hrs.
__label__2 Like the energizer - just keeps going...: It is amazing how much hair this thing cat pull off of a cat. Keep in mind though, that it takes a LOT of brushing to get the job done. It is not a quick job and you are done.
__label__2 One awesome electronic device: This device is incredible. It is simple and efficient to use, creating the same 7 metal sounds Dan Donegan uses on the albums The sickness and Prayer. Buy this pedal and you will be able to sound just like dan's riffs. Plus with the other stuff u get, it is a good bargain. I recommend, however, for those looking for a supreme pedal that allows tons and tons of customizations and effects, buy the god of them all, the zoom 505 II or 606. It is the best.
__label__1 Doesn't work!!!: I can not get the game to install on my computer. When I try, it changes the settings on my display and trys to register, but can not. I tried to look for updates, but the Zoombinis website no longer exists. I am very disappointed in the game, maybe the game is just too old. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated. My kids play it at school and love it, but we can't get this one working.
__label__2 Envirocycle Composter Review: I wasn't sure what to expect since I'd never used a composter like this before. There's a certain learning curve to using it, but I think I'm on the right page now. The design is clever and I like the way it looks. It's a little heavier to turn than I expected, but maybe I'm just beginning to show my age. I'm generally pleased with this transaction with Amazon.Com. Found what I wanted, ordered it and received it in good time. What more can I ask?
__label__2 Complex and Fascinating: This was the first I've ever heard of 'Pope Joan' and I found the story to be no only interesting but written with tender truth. Tender truths not just about the character but also excerpts that you can apply to your own life. There's wisdom in this novel.
__label__2 Breathtaking...: Soulful, breathtaking, passionate, mysterious and mystical are all words that would accurately describe both Anna Vissi and this album. The artist's incredible voice coupled with the instrumentation make this CD a wonderful addition to any music collector's library!
__label__1 Never ABRIDGE: I had trouble following the characters in this audio, yet Rule has a fluid writing style that makes a true story read like fiction. But in this abridged audio version, this talent makes itself apparent only in spurts. I think this is due to the abridgement process.I feel the same way about abridgment as I feel about watching a movie reformatted to fit the television screen; if I am going to invest the time in viewing the movie, I want ALL of the movie. So even if I were reduced to a 12 inch screen, I would want to see the movie in letterbox, if possible.So too, if I am going to listen to a book, I want the WHOLE book. Granted, there are things such as charts and graphs that are tedious in audio, these things are best described in brief, but I do not think this is the sort of pruning and clipping that took place in this abridgement; otherwise, I would have found the characters easier to follow because they would have been much more developed.
__label__1 Mini version: Beware - this book is only 3.5" by 6" in size. The content is exactly what I was looking for but there was nothing in the ad to warn me that it was so small.
__label__1 Good Idea; Poor Item: I loved the idea of this product. It was highly recommended by a men's magazine that I read recently. I wanted to utilize this product for all of my personal grooming needs.The notion that you can use it in/out of the shower and wet/dry was very appealing.I wish it lived up to the hype.This product ripped instead of cut. It was very painful. It also gave me razor burn despite my multiple attempts to utilize it correctly.I returned it.
__label__1 Too leaky: The water bottle has treated me well and leakyness was always an issue but not as big of a problem. Every time I go to take a sip in class, I spill water all over myself and I'm pretty annoyed with it (yes the cap is securely on). Either way I would never recommend this bottle to anyone.
__label__1 i can't even look at it any more: the first hint that this was all going to end badly should have been the early misuse of a dorothy parker poem. but alas, i found the book well written at first. specifically, i appreciated some of the character development. but halfway through i realised, 'well, it's great for a first novel' only to discover it wasn't a first novel, so there was no reason for the author to be trying so hard. by 2/3 of the way through i realised that it was only getting worse. and, well, the final 30 pages had me muttering and ranting out loud. magic without context, poor transitions and questionable use of vocabulary made this a very difficult read.my husband likes to remind me that i don't have to finish a book if i don't like it. but sadly, i do. and so i finished it. i will agree with the cover review that stated it was 'haunting' for i will likely be depressed about having read it for a while.nice use of pullman's daemons concept though. truely original. </sarcasm>
__label__2 Very good series: The first book of this series was very well written and a real page turner. I had to read the second and third book soon after.
__label__2 "ERNIE LEARNED FROM JIMI": I HAVE HAD "HIGH WIRE" FROM ERNIE ISLEY ON CASSETTE ONCE AND CD TWICE. I HAD SOLD BOTH COPIES OF MY CD'S TO FRIENDS WHO HEARD IT & HAD TO HAVE IT. THIS CD HAS IT ALL: ROCK, FUNK, SOUL, BLUES. VERY DIVERSE. LAST THURSDAY (AUGUST 5) I WENT TO SEE THE ISLEY BROS. IN CONCERT IN SHREVEPORT, LA. WHAT I DID NOT KNOW WAS THAT RONALD ISLEY HAD A STROKE AND WOULD NOT BE THERE. SO, THE AUDITORIUM GOT A CHANCE FOR A ERNIE ISLEY CONCERT. HE WAS GREAT!! (FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, JIMI HENDRIX LIVED WITH THE ISLEY BROS. FOR A WHILE IN THE EARLY 60'S, AND A 12 YEAR OLD ERNIE WOULD LEARN FROM THE MAN).ANYWAY, ENOUGH OF MY YAPPING, IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ISLEY BROS. OR GREAT BLUES/FUNK/ROCK GUITAR, CHECK "HIGH WIRE" FROM ERNIE ISLEY.
__label__2 Easy to Install: Great Product, we got it to mount a tv in our Bathroom. works great, Highly Recommended !!
__label__2 Its good, but I bought it too soon.: I have to agree with another reviewer here. The book had more information than I new what to do with at this time, since I am just considering a career change into the computer field. I know I want to be a computer consultant, but I got a bit intimidated by all the info this book has. Which is good, in general, but I guess I should have purchased it a bit down the line when I am close to completing my training.I took the advice of another reviewer here and bought "The Secret Path to Contract Programming Riches," because it is the only programming/consulting book I've found that was written for those in the absolute beginner, from a technical perspective.I will keep this book and refer to it as I near completion of my training, so I can move into consulting as quickly as I can.I would have given it 5 stars, but as I said, I am too new to this field and could not digest it all yet.
__label__2 Reliable and straightforward DVD player: For the 5 or so years I've had this player it's been a real trooper. It's been easy to setup and use. The only "disc error" issues have arisen from burned discs that might have been overly compressed, or with a codec that is too new for it. However, among the virtues I've found with this device, is the wonderful quality of audio I get using the optical out with my component stereo system. The only knock against it: right near the beginning of playing almost any DVD, like a record, it skips one second of audio and then continues with no problem the rest of the way. I never understood this, but have lived easily with it.Overall, this DVD player has served me well, and I would recommend it to most folks. Of course, with many things headed toward HD, this unit is pretty well obsolete. However, if you are currently happy not needing to see every pore on a person, instead opting for an engaging story, this unit is simple and perfect.
__label__1 MOORE LIED!! www.gunowners.org/opmoore01.htm: When someone does a documentary, it is supposed to be like reporting the news. Having said that, MR. MOORE MADE UP MOST OF THIS MOVIE, then he made it in a documentary style to make it seem like he's telling the truth! There is almost no statement in this movie that is true. If you want the truth, go to www.gunowners.org/jpfoib.htm.
__label__1 Nice pix, but.........: I'm afraid I have to agree with Mr. Noble and pvjim- the pictures are pretty cool but the text is not. Neither I nor anyone I know in the sport of motorcycle racing has ever heard the term "lime juicers"- Scalzo must have simply made this up. The story line jumps around and is hard to follow chronologically and the part about the Honda RS750 is simply completely wrong. I'm glad I bought the book for the pictures and because there is so little in print on the subject, but there are so many mistakes in grammar, spelling and historical accurracy that I could not in good conscience use this book as a source for any other article or book. Still, if you are 8 years old, the pictures are cool!
__label__2 Protect yourself from dangerous ultraviolet reys !: The best you can buy and is highly recommended by my Dermatologist and consumer's reports.
__label__1 detroit ain't 70's cleveland: Let's just say these songs are not lyrically driven. So many songs sound unrehearsed, out of tune, though a few are amusing enough to keep some interest, "here comes that sound again," "cedar point '76," and "they hate us in scandinavia." I'm not sure why this collection leaves out their best tune, "Do You See My Love (For You Growing)"? Much is borrowed from The Stooges and early Pere Ubu (Rocket from the Tombs), which offers nothing new. Mick Collins says the best stuff is on compilations, if he's right; (which he's not) try The Sympathetic Sounds of Detroit lp, which is the best Detroit has this side of the White Stripes.
__label__1 Yikes: I completely agree with the reviewers who rated this book a two or below. Philadelphia Fox is one of the most ridiculous heroins I have ever come across. Annoying and unlikeable. Nicodemus Lightfoot, on the other hand, was the only redeeming factor in this book. He was a true Jayne Krentz character, a take charge kind of person. Unlike Philadelphia, he was not so indecisive.Oh, I almost forgot to comment on the "relationship" between the hero and heroin. I saw very little closeness between Phila and Nick, other than in the bedroom. I can't understand how anyone could mistake that for tenderness.This book is definitely one I would recomend you DON'T read. If you want a good book check out some of Krentz's others. Deep Waters, for example.
__label__2 WOW!!!!: Oh my gosh, I saw this book in the store one day and I knew I had to have it for my own. I read half of it in the car and finished when I got home. I even told my friends in the Starwars chats about it. They loved it. YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK. I guarantee that you will not be dissapointed.
__label__2 Grwst: Excellent in 3d, love the colors , love the actingBest fantasy movieBlu ray a mustSo funny too
__label__1 dud: i bought this book as i was turning the last few pages of lonesome dove hungry for more stories of gus and mcrae. i was sorely disappointed, this was just plain awful. mcmurtry's writing style changed, so much that i'm convinced he didn't write it. maybe he came up with the story but this wasn't the pulitzer prize winning prose we enjoyed in _ld_. gus and mcrae were wimpy characters, rarely shaping their own world, trudging through a storyline of doom only to end in a scene that made me literally throw the book across the room. i wouldn't read this unless you are totally desperate for another ld novel, or want to say that you `read every ld book' published.
__label__1 Waste of Money: Don't waste your money. We purchased two; they have been in the ground for three weeks and the moles are still very active and within 6 feet of the molechaser.
__label__2 Child of Promise: I've enjoyed reading all of the books by Kathleen Morgan and this was a very good book.
__label__2 The Hidden Things: A shocking account, honestly and graphically written. Amazing that anyone could survive something like this. Very helpful for anyone else who may have gone through this sort of thing. Thankfully, I didn't, but there is far too much of this and it must be told.
__label__2 a new essential in my kitchen: This versatile gadget is lovely as a trivet--pretty indestructible yet attractive enough to have on a tabletop while serving, but is really fabulous as a meat rack. It makes a great weight when pan frying something such as a pork chop (in your lodge cast iron, of course) and you want to brown and sear it before tossing it in the oven.
__label__2 Wonderful Product: I bought this dovetail jig as a Christmas present for my husband. He builds cabinets and furniture and he absolutly loved this item. When making drawers it can't be beat!!
__label__1 VHS edition has extremely poor picture quality: As delighted as I am to finally get the whole season one of MASH on video, I am very disappointed by the poor quality. The VHS tapes are recorded in EP mode, and somehow I could adjust my VCR's tracking only to either get a distorted picture and good sound, or acceptable picture quality and distorted sound.Also, the episodes are arranged in production order rather than broadcast order. This makes more sense as far as some of the story lines are concerned, but the VHS boxes list the episodes in broadcast order, and therefore are useless.MASH is a great series, and it was great to see these episodes again, but the viewing pleasure was spoilt a lot by the extremely poor quality of the VHS edition. If you own a DVD player that plays region 1 tapes (mine only plays region 2), go for the DVD edition, by all means.
__label__1 No classic in my mind: After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book. I am new to readint "the classics" and after looking at several "classic" reading lists found this book to be on several. I decided to read the book and even completed it against my better judgement. I found the book extremely boring and would not recomend it to anyone outside of maybe teenage girls.
__label__2 Harry Potter: It's a Harry Potter movie so of course it's great! One of the best series every written and then put into film!
__label__2 A Struggle But Worth It!: Faulkner is a very challenging writer. The first half of The Sound and the Fury is especially difficult, but hang in there because it is a great story. Light in August is Faulkner at his best attempting to explicate incredibly complex issues of race. These books are a good start to his literature, but by no means a complete sampling. He does stereotype his black characters but he is also doing more than that with them (so I encourage you to read the characters closely); his black characters are also a progression in his literature which shows his growth as a writer and observer of the human condition.
__label__2 Unusual true stories about ships: I really enjoyed the author's unique stories of similar, but extraordinary sea experiences. The unusual tales of over 200 ships are grouped under 20 separate chapters. There are tales of mystery ships, mutinies, animal antics, piracy, phenomena of the unknown and more in these highly readable short stories. I was given this book by a colleague only to find that I am captivated by a world about which I knew nothing.
__label__2 Samsung LNS3251D: After researching LCD TVs of this size for a few days, I decided on this one after seeing it in action at the store. I came home and checked prices online and realized this TV, brand new, was around $500 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy. The shipping takes a while if you get Eagle, but the savings is worth the wait.The only big problem I've read about with this TV is that some apparently have dead pixels, but not mine. The quality is nice. I have it hooked up to my Xbox 360 and set to "Game Mode" and the graphics are simply amazing.People are saying the sound is lackluster and they are probably right. I have always used the speakers on my TV so I have no point of reference, but they have served me well.All in all, this is an excellent TV for anyone looking to go high-def without paying the ridiculous prices they charge at chain stores.
__label__1 Tape Doesn't Stick: This was the only window insulation system available at lowes home improvement. The double sided tape does not stick to the window but does stick to the plastic. I will be trying another manufacturer in the future.
__label__2 Great lens: It arrived this afternoon. I took some photos of my friend and the pictures were quite satisfying. It is better than I expected.
__label__2 Charming Funny and witty Dudley best: Poor alcoholic rich boy makes good. Dudley Moore was at is maximum charm with this performance. He brightened each scene with his antics and his subtle remarks. The man who never worked could have everything, including the beautiful Susan, a marriage arranged by their families. But then he met and unorthodox young female who had just been caught shoplifting, a common sort, and she changed his life.When I heard about Dudley becoming ill this is the movie I immediately thought of.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: These replacements work, but they're clearly made out of some sort of cheap rubber. it gets dirty particularly quickly and doesn't conform as well
__label__2 drowning dreams: Before climate change there was radiation and fears of the nuclear, but in this 1962 novel the seas have risen just the same and the remaining cities of the old world, flooded, supra heated, abandoned, reverting back to the prehistoric are all that remains.As much a novel of the psychological reversion as it is to do with any plot or great events, this is a strange but compelling kind of science-fiction. It is one of Ballard's earliest work and his language is ornate and his love of the extravagant simile here in abundance.
__label__2 Great!!: Purchased for my fiance for a birthday gift. His copy of the movie was lost when we had a fire in our home in 2011. We were not aware of the loss of the DVD till we moved into our new home and started unpacking and realized that we had the case but no cd and then realized it was in our DVD/BlueRay player that was ruined in the house fire. Great clarity in picture and price was decent.
__label__2 A lovely book about expressing love through everyday chores: This book is mesmerisingly honest and artfully structured. Ehrlich's mid-life spiritual awakening in the kitchen resonates with my own--although I'm a midwesterner of Irish Catholic descent. Anyone who knows that suffering teaches us to cherish and nurture life will find affirmation in this book.
__label__2 good reading: This is a timeless classic, it really doesn't need another review. Anyone interested in colonial history already knows the story, and Fenimore Cooper although prone to wordiness does include enough details of daily existence to keep things interesting.
__label__2 COOL!: THIS IS AN OLD BUT VERY GOOD GAME. It is one of the best shooting games I played yet and is a lot like the movie. The weapons could improve though
__label__2 Grisham Holds You: This may not be a standard Grisham theme, but who really cares if it isn't! The characters still shine, you care about them and are caught in their journey. It was a good read, and set up nicely for a sequel, i.e. what are the real fates of Luke, Tally and the rest?
__label__1 bad quality and can injure you: These are poor quality. I can't even use them to cut the crab shell. The handle is made so that it is very easy to pinch the inside of your hand (and it still doesn't cut the shell). I have already gotten a couple blood blisters from them. I chose to toss them over injuring myself. Expensive mistake.
__label__2 Scrumptiously Illustrated Fantasy For All!: Having always been fascinated by those giants who roamed the planet eons ago, I had to have this one upon its initial publication. "Dinotopia's" tale of a land jointly inhabited by man and dinosaur is a truly captivating adventure.As fanciful as the premise is, the author logically develops the dinosaur characters based on the uniqueness of each respective species. Most are "good" and commune well with their fellow humans; but the T-Rex is still his usual grouchy self, much to the appreciation of us who were raised with the knowledge that the animal was one mean carnivore!By placing the setting in the 1800's, the book could have been written by Wells or Verne, which gives it the feel of a classic.And a classic, it is.
__label__1 Dual Disks stink: Thanks Rhino/Warners for beta testing a failed format on your customers. I can't even comment on the music because the format is so flawed.
__label__1 Worst Ending EVER!: The book started out pretty good, but when I read that lame ending, I was really annoyed at the cop-out that it was. Choosing a new book is an investment of the reader's time and some trust is put into the author's ability to tell a good story. From START to FINISH. This ending turned this book into a tease. The author obviously had an editor deadline and rushed it. Maybe the editor finished it herself. Anybody can come up with the begining and middle of a mystery. It takes real talent and skill to satifactorally tie up all the loose ends and not leave the reader feeling like a sucker! I won't waste my time on this author again.
__label__1 The most unimaginative film: I saw this film with two friends. We all agreed that this film was one of the worst films we have ever seen. The dialog was trite and unimaginative. The only pleasure we had watching this film was mimicking the actor's repeated lines "Oh my God! What are you doing here?"
__label__2 one smart bunny: I stumbled upon this book at a local library and as my in-laws are Korean-American I bought it for one of my nieces. I think my sister-in-law liked it more than her daughter. My mother-in-law didn't recall this tale exactly, but said that stories of wise animals are quite common in Korea. The pictures are a little too primative for my taste, but I liked the story and the fact that it was bi-lingual, which is nearly impossible to find in any language, nevermind in Korean/English. The layout is nice with Korean on one side, English on the other. I bought another copy for a friend that just adopted a little Korean girl and for my own daughter. I've never been able to find anything else like it (except for the other book that Ms Han wrote also involving wise animals).
__label__2 does the job: I bought this because I have been using witch hazel for about a year now and the smell of just plain witch hazel is not so great! Lol I decided to give this a go and I like it. It tones my face, takes off any remaining makeup left behind from my face wash and doesn't dry my face out. The smell is ok, not my favorite, I have another scent by this brand that I enjoy much more.
__label__1 Blacked out completely after a few months: Off warranty, of course. It worked fine for several months then started looking pinkish for a couple of days then blacked out completely. Spend the money for a decent brand.
__label__2 Contaminant Hydrogeology - C. W. Fetter: This is a great introductory book on transport of contaminants in groundwater. Maybe a bit outdated but still a great piece of work.
__label__1 From the bargain bin to the trash bin...: What a piece of work. The good guys use radar underwater, the big bad shark can chew up a nuclear sub, and our cardboard hero kills the shark by ripping its heart out from the inside, via mini submarine. This is without a doubt the worst book ever put to paper. I threw it in the trash with twenty pages to go. "A novel of deep terror", indeed...I fear the movie already.
__label__1 Kind of Weak: This wasn't the worst book I've read, but it was far from the best. Considering the author was a man writting about male characters, I was expecting more of a "males point of view" and not the typical stuff we always hear, I was very disappointed. The characters and over all story line was weak, predicatable and almost boring. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen, but it never did. Also, Mr. Baisden needs to find a new editor, there's no excuse for the typo's in this book. Better luck next time.
__label__2 complex but ultimately exciting: Do not read this book unless you have read its predecessors in the series, else you will be submerged in a confusing avalanche of subplots and information. The story moves apace and pays homage to the mystique of Sir Francis Richard Burton, the English explorer of the last century. One is left with the sensation that our history has been much involved with warring alien factions, and that, perhaps, more historic anomalies shall be explained, the Knights Templar having been mentioned. The story is, however, compelling and one is carried along with the mystery. The great antiquity of the Sphinx is confirmed and the Arch of the Covenant found. The horrors of nanotechnology released on Easter Island. The sequel is going to have to deal with a lot of problems.
__label__2 Vintage Agatha Christie: A cracking good Agatha Christie murder mystery with no detective (until the very end). Written in 1939 and set in that time, it omits the modern crime-solving techniques and even things like cell phones. It doesn't take long for the reader to be swept up in the situation at hand, however, and to try to guess the identity of the murderer, until he or she is murdered. The end seems a bit contrived, but plausible. A good book for a discussion group.
__label__1 I would suggest a different product.: It was good for three months but after that it started making noise and crapped out after one year. Looks good but not the best product.
__label__2 Cowboys From Hell Bring a Piece of Heaven to METAL: This satisfying slab of killer tunes proves once more that "Metal" is alive and well. Pantera continue to stay true to the cause. These veterans are taking now prisoners. What else can i say, i'm speechless...
__label__1 Dissapointing!: I love Stephen Dillane which is why I picked this movie. His performance was very good but the overall movie was weird and jerky. The "no script" thing shows how important a script is. I hope the director bagged that idea after this movie. It is painfully apparent when Stephen Dillanes character runs into Victoria Foyt's character at the house in London, she just keeps saying "what are you doing here?" and Dillane doesn't respond. The bedtime conversations between the old couple that owns the house are just plain weird and completely irrelevant. I agree with the other reviewer that Victoria Foyt's character comes off incredibly whiney! The other story lines - Vanessa Redgraves - would have meaning if they were in turn experiencing some sort of Deja Vu but they don't. I would pass on this movie, this director and certainly Victoria Foyt.
__label__2 jeff dunham spark insanity: I love this dvd I have ordered many of this one because it is sooo funny and great to watch even over and over. I have passed this one out to my loved ones for the holidays and birthdays. They all raved about it!!!!
__label__1 Sad!!: It was shipped at normal time, but the stethoscope came damaged, with a perforation at it body.I'm sad about it!
__label__1 Very Fluffy Music: Her previous 3 albums were very tastefully done and her songs made much more sense and the lyrics and the videos were not out of hand. UP! is a disaster waiting to happen first off there are way too many tracks on this album I say the limit is 10 to 12 songs on a album but no more then that. There is just two much material. here. The songs were just stupit and there just unreal. Country music is about being real and her latest video does not look very real at all and even if this is supposed to be pop it's pretty bad. Double cd's red and green cd's and a fluffy album cover the album is just too much. I compare this album to overfilling your dinner plate at a buffet.
__label__1 Useless: I have natural hair and I find that this product does absolutely nothing. It is a VERY light oil and seems to be most appropriate for very fine textured, relaxed hair.
__label__2 Amazing: I picked up this camera to do a web catalog photo shoot of flowers. I found it to be an impressive camera for its size. Get the IBM Microdrive because the 3 megapixel images will fill up a memory card fast!Battery life was good but it uses a proprietary battery. It also takes 2CR5s but eats them up in a hurry.Very good image quality, works well in macro mode. One thing I wish it had is the ability to review the image right after you took it. You can't do it easily, you have to switch camera modes and the lens closes up. With the microdrive you can afford to take extra shots and weed out the bad ones later.Good transfer software although the serial cable mode is incredibly slow...go with USB.All in all, I love this little camera which packs a punch.
__label__1 Not sized right: The pants I purchased were 3X and labled 3X. When the waist was stretched out it was 48 inches. I have only a 30 inch inseam but the legs were short. On the package slip there is no return information and no way to contact the seller. Definatly not comfortable pants to lounge in.
__label__1 Peeling finish and snarky customer service.: This review is for the oil-rubbed bronze finish. After a few months of light duty, the dark bronze finish on the removable strainer began peeling off, revealing the chrome underneath. The finish appears to be plasticized paint. This rapid failure of the finish with light use and mild dish washing liquid was a huge disappointment, especially considering the premium price tag.A call to customer service was equally disappointing. Though still under warranty, we were told we had caused the problem by using soap. Yes, we were told that if we are going to use soap, we must first remove the strainer. Point of note: The duostrainer has two purposes. Hence, "duo." (1)Strainer. (2)Stopper. Both functions are to be performed in a kitchen sink. To wash dishes. With soap.They finally agreed to send us a replacement strainer, which we fully expect to perform just like the first one.
__label__2 He loves it!: Perfect for little hands. Great colors. Easy to just toss in a bag. It's wonderful and my son loves it!
__label__2 WHAT A BUY!: This thing is a life saver. Great design, easy to use, good price. There are many salad spinners in this world that you can buy for 10 or 12 dollars, but they are nothing like this. This is a wonderful product from a reliable company. This would make a great birthday or bridal shower gift for someone that likes to cook and likes to eat healthy!
__label__2 A brilliant song from a brilliant trio!: 3 of the best singers in pop- Ultra Naté, Amber and Jocelyn Enriquez. I listen to this single everyday. It's a blend pop and dance. You have got to get this single, it's just FANtastic. James Kinnear, Cheltenham
__label__2 This book is worth keeping it: I like this book. It explains basic science pretty well. It is my textbook for my class and I'm considering keeping it. I bought it used and got a copy in good condition. It was a great purchase.
__label__1 Tedious and boring: This book has the right idea--write a book about urban legends and explain how they came about. It's too bad that they blow it completely! They give you the original urban legend--and then EVERY variation of it. It gets boring very quickly. Even worse is that the author recreates it in EXACTLY the words it was spoken or written. That's comendable but the writing styles are all over the place! Some work as they are--others are next to impossible to read. Even worse is that thr authors explanations of legends and their origins are very VERY dry and dull. Not recommended.
__label__1 Barely fits my 22 month old son: My son loves Diego. He was Diego for Halloween. When we received it through Amazon, I was suprised at how poor the vest was constructed and the cheap materials used. AND it barely fit my son who is tall for his age but not even two. So just FYI, if you still decide to purchase this item, know it runs very small. The toys that came with it were fun for my son and he plays with those but not so much the vest.
__label__2 VERY GOOD: this movie is a great show for kidswith martin sheen lovely voicemy favorite part is the hailstormpart
__label__1 The WORST prob & stats book !!: I feel much better after reading other reviews of this book - I am not the only one or the reason for this . This book is very deficient . . Especially for undergraduate learners .
__label__1 horrible item do not buy!!!: my broter used this and dont get me wrong he is only 2 and he push it and the crappy item broke! on my bro!!!
__label__1 Bum one!: It didnt work! Upon first use out of the box it barely heated up twenty minutes later on highest setting. Ugh.
__label__2 Good album, but only if you keep an open mind: I liked this album better than "Load." Granted, it bears little resemblance to Metallica's earlier, more popular stuff, but "Reload" is still a pretty good album. I think the backlash to the Loads partly lies in the fact that there were several years in between "Metallica" and "Load"; I suppose most people were expecting "Load" to be another "Metallica." But if you keep an open mind, you will surely enjoy "Reload" at least a little.
__label__2 Small but powerful: Don't let the size fool you, this fan does the job. With a dial to control the speed, and a stand, the fan is built solid and puts out the desired effect. I actually dangle the fan over the exhaust of the internal fan and it does an amazing job to pull the heat out of the tower. With an I7 processor, my room would get uncomfortably hot, but now I point it to the door and it at least gets rid of some of the excess heat.
__label__2 Scrabble: Awesome! At last a Scrabble game for Macs that works with OS 10 and doesn't require that the disc be inserted to play a game.
__label__1 Great plot, but where's the character development?: I agree with the reviewer who said the characters were either the essence of goodness or vile and evil. Yes, the book is a great page turner and the plot is intricate and interesting, but without dimension to the characters, it's not a memorable novel. I'm surprised by all the praise being thrown around, frankly. Maybe I just need character driven fiction to make reading worth my while--for a good yarn with no depth, I'd rather watch TV.
__label__2 Great value and they work!: These tabs are great for the unfortunate circumstance of your dog getting worms. I especially liked them because they came with enough tabs to treat the dog once, as well as follow-up if necessary, and they cost much less than the competing product.
__label__1 does not fit my pack-n-play: I purchased this canopy for use on my brand new graco pack-n-play and it does not fit! I was attempting to put it together when i read in the instructions that it does not fit if you have a rounded edge pack-n-play. Nowhere in the description when I purchased it was this mentioned. I had to buy it, open it, then read it in the instruction booklet- What a waste of time!!!!! I ended up purchasing the sport/outdoors pack-n-play by Graco for use outdoors and i love it! It is great for being outside. I would recommend this one instead of the canopy.
__label__2 Fantastic: I absolutely love these shoes!! In fact, I like them so much, that I have ordered 8 pairs in different styles. They fit great. I can't say enough about these shoes.
__label__1 Creative Mistake: The speakers are decent for the price, but I suggest that you buy other speakers if you are looking for bass.The sub-woofer was built like junk. As a result the sub produces bass like junk.The wired-remote that this product comes with has two dials (1 for volume and 1 for bass).The bass dial can go up to 9, however as soon as you pass 4 the speaker begins to rattle.I like my bass in music, but the rattling the sub makes muffles out all the bass, including the rest of the speakers.I gave this set of speakers 2 stars, because the mid/high ranged satellite speakers produce ample sound.I recommend buying another system.
__label__1 You probably don't need it: I bought these for the Honeywell Humidifer I bought but the unit is so easy to clean I don't think I need-plus the directions I got said to put it under the heating coil and I didn't want to do that for fear it would heat up (???) if the unit ran dry and maybe become harmful.
__label__2 Love it: I grill pretty regularly and have had this grill for around a year. Its a no-brainer; it works, is big, and is relatively expensive.Its easy to clean out the bottom, and easy to control the temperature of your coals by adjusting the vent at the top and bottom. And, after you're done, you can close both vents and put the top on to smother the coals. I always end up being able to reuse most of my coals the next time I cook out.The body of the grill is still in very good shape. I can find no corrosion to speak of.My only complaints are that the ash catching plate, the way its held on, and the legs are kind of cheezy. Ive only had a couple times where they gave me any problems, none of which were serious.I'd also suggest you get the weber chimney starter and coal baskets to go along with your grill. They've both made grilling a snap.Definitely a good buy for the money.
__label__1 Worthless: Worthless. Angle is all wrong. Just does not do what it is designed to do.A spray bottle with water and a 4" scraper works much better.
__label__2 Lush Musical Soundscape, Great Recording: Very rich and musical New Age music. Bartz is a gifted composer, player and engineer - if you enjoy instrumental music that does not rely on standard 4/4 and a catchy riff to make a tune, you might like the drifting, rich, but solid fare offered here.
__label__2 Dig the Derf: Derf Reklaw sounds like he'd be one of those twee Scandenavian ECM piano guys- BUT HE'S NOT! He's one hardcore drum and flute dude! Ole is MY FAVORITE JOHN COLTRANE COVER EVER! Good, heady party music- unless you live in the Willamette Valley, then no one will get it. I pity them.
__label__2 5 stars so far...: This game, after only playing through 2 dungeons, is a work of art. All of the controversy over the graphics should be laid to rest. You'll find yourself in the heat of battle, distracted by the time and attention to detail that the "artists" at nintendo put into this game. The dungeons have been a little on the easy side so far, but as a veteran of the Zelda series, I know they will get increasingly more difficult as the game progresses. Sailing on the ocean for the first time reveals a world that is overwhelming. You will feel like you can explore for months and never scratch the surface. I sat in line for an hour for my reserved copy and it was well worth the wait. If you consider yourself a true gamer, you need to get this game and witness for yourself the evolution of video games.
__label__2 Humorous yet Serious: Great Read. It is the best book that I have read in a long time. It is hilarous. But the thing that makes it so funny is the fact that it is very real and very serious. I couldn't stop laughing when it said that if your parachute dosen't open and you have to latch on to a friend that you will inevitably break both of your arms and if you are lucky only one of your legs. It is a great book and i recommend it to everyone.
__label__1 Not my cup of tea: I am a fan of the strong female lead and since Lee Childs wrote an introduction of sorts to this book I bought it, thinking that Zoe might be (perhaps a distant and murky and of a lineage thrice removed but still) a relation to Jack Reacher and his approach to life. It was not so. Zoe is a person all her own, but for me she is drawn in blurry strokes, I am not entirely sure what she is, and I have no interest in reading more about her.The entire book reminded me of old-style British mysteries, for some reason.
__label__2 MATHEMATICSPHYSICS1@prodigy.net: This book is a gem of the introductory calculus classics. However, in recent years, there exist a lot of other excellent calculus texts. I would recommend you to use this classic as a reference rather than a formal text.
__label__2 A Modern Day Fairy Tale Classic: One of my absolute favorites, this gem of a film is a comedy, a drama, a romance and a fantasy film all rolled into one. Combined with the twisted & irreverent filmmaking style of Terry Gilliam ("12 Monkeys" and "Time Bandits") this film is not for everyone, but for those who like something different and maybe even a little magical, you can't go wrong with this one. Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges are two men from two different worlds, but both lost and in pain. Mercedes Ruehl and Amanda Plummer are the women in their lives. When circumstanes bring them together, they are able to save one another. A sadly overlooked film filled with wonderment and, in the end, joy.
__label__1 what a buch of lies...: I'm from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. I watched Celine from 14 y/o till today. I'm not a big fan but we have to give her her wonderfull talent, great voice and all the success she had. The rest is all wrong, what do you want it's not because your an author that you're smart. That guy just want to make a few bucks fast. It's a shame that poeple can spitt on other in the name of jalousy. Shame on you everyone who wrote a positive review. Obviosly you had no reference and never been to Montreal or herd Celine in interview.
__label__2 WOW!: I love this album by Miles. "He Loved Him Madly" is just so wonderful. Understated, yet locks into such a groove. I got to see Miles once in concert. He played music like this on a revolving stage. One of the best if not the best show I've ever seen. Try to find this one.
__label__1 TiVo Download Is Corrupted: I had to use my Xbox to rent this movie from Microsoft's Zune market, because four attempts to download to TiVo with Amazon resulted in the audio being out of sync, and video skipping. This has been happening more frequently lately, I suspect that it's possibly the new copy protection codec that Amazon is using? Please fix this issue! Not all videos have it.
__label__1 Good, but some stale cookies..: I ordered a dozen of these boxes early May of 2012. Cookies were individually packaged and packed box consistently of 12, but I still received a number of stale cookies. The "best by" date for all the cookies are July 8 2012. These leaves me with only two months left. I would expect at least a few more than two months on these.The cookies are tasty, but as good as Panda Express's. I would buy again, but they really need to send fresher cookies.5-31-12 update, ranked down from 4-> 2 stars. I'm getting a lot more stale and crashed cookies.
__label__2 Works Perfectly!: This mouse which I have bought recently through Amazon works relaly good. The USB which is attached to the computer fits in the mouse when not used. Also, the wireless works a long distance and is fast and easy to operate.
__label__1 Horrible product.: Product look and sounds great on the computer, but is virtually useless in the field. Straps were uncomfortable, and did not secure properly. Also size was way smaller than it seems.
__label__2 Linda Rides Again... An Amazing Comeback: I can't believe how great this album is. Fashionable Late ranks with the best works of Richard & Linda Thompson. The disc starts out with "Dear Mary," with both Richard and son Teddy supporting on vocals and guitars. This song and the others that follow have wonderful melancholic feel similar to I Want To See The Bright Light Tonight (R & L's masterpiece). Lovely Northern English singer Kate Rusby provides perfect harmony accompaniment on much of the album. Their voices blend perfectly. A triumphant return and one of the best albums of the year.
__label__1 live or memorex?: After listening to The Power of Love, it was clear that Celine was either lip syncing or singing along with a taped version of the song. Any musician can tell that the band behind Celine is not what's on the audio track: live performance does not sound exactly like "the record". The fact that you can't tell if Celine is really singing (on many songs) even makes this more disturbing. Applause is faded in and out like a laugh track on a sitcom.
__label__2 Lockers' color are pretty: This movie is interesting, but not as funny as I thought.The music is great. I actually laugh when I heard that back street boy's song.Altough I like this film a lot, I still feel bad about Napoleon never smile or looked happy in the all time.
__label__2 Great Movie!: Even though this is an older sci fi movie it still a good watch. My husband & I watched it again the other night and it was very entertaining.
__label__1 Too bad, because the premise was good: I picked this up and read the back and the blurbs and it sounded like it would be interesting, if not a good read. Unfortunately, this book was bad from the first paragraph on. There were so many names and characters just thrown at me, I could hardly tell when the story started to advance. The immediate establishment of the military guys bad, us civillians good, was also irritating, since neither side was able to prove themselves anything other than their labeling. I was so confused after the first sixty pages, I had to give up. The book had gone from confusing to impossible to follow. At that point, I'd already lost interest in the characters, since I could hardly tell what was going on, and could have cared less about their fates.
__label__1 poor product: junk, cheap ,dont buy wont do nothing,wont hold nothing,rip off.pure and simply.its to hard to just trust amazon to sell good products anymore.i wont buy anything from them any more..the company has lost its ,care for the customer.and dont care who sells what or how the product is,.sad i love the products in the past.but now its dog eat dog......
__label__2 Randy Quaid was not short of genius as LBJ: This is such a great movie I was glad to hear that Randy Quaid won a Best Actor Golden Globe for his great performance. For anyone who wants to get this on dvd I would check this website because so far it is the only one that makes the dvd unlike those heartless dvd companies. Here's the website; [...]
__label__1 not worth the money: this dual wan router is not worth the money. i tried using it with a cable and a dsl modem and it did not split the bandwidth between them. the reason i bought it was becasue i have 6 playstations online and 4 computers online i thought it would give me greater bandwidth. well not true because you need more upload speed rather than download speed and it can only go as fast as your isp lets u. so if u are a gamer online its not worth it. i returned it to amazon for refund. instead of buying this product i just made 2 different networks one for computers and one for the playstations.
__label__2 Great product and service: The service was great. I received the book within the alloted time and in the advertised quality. I can't wait to sit down and read it. Christopher Dawson is a terrific writer and historian.
__label__2 "More bang for your buck": I take Hyaluronic acid daily for natural joint relief. I usually take 3 or 4 tablets because the ones I usually buy are only 20 mgs. When I saw this dosage I thought I'd give it a try. I've used NOW products before so it is a brand I know and trust. It sure is nice to take less tablets since I'm always taking a handful of supplements already! This potency seemed pure, gentle to my stomach, dissolves completely because of the gelatin capsules, and the price seemed reasonable for what you're getting. The way I see it, it's more bang for your buck for the choices that are out there in the stores.
__label__1 this part is probobly from my box: marineco gives these with these chargers and mine3 was not in my box- so they proboboly sold it to you.
__label__2 Bad Girl is GOOD: Maya Reynolds wrote an excellent story that borders on kink and satisfies the reader. I look forward to more work by Ms Reynolds.
__label__1 The aristocracy:Never the same again: I bought this specifically for the reference to Lady Mairi Bury at Mountstewart and it was ot o the tape at all - must have been edited out.Very dissappointing indeed.
__label__2 Excellent book for beginners: Excellent book to learn about watercolours - simple and straightforward with loads of practical examples. There are lots of good ideas to get going with watercolours.
__label__1 Oh my word...: What on EARTH is this, I ask?You'd think if a professional company got together and said, 'Let's make a CD of songs from Les Mis!' they'd at least deign to do it properly.This sounds like some kind of recording your local high school put together. (No, I take that back...your local high school could probably do a better job.)These people can't sing, they have no emotion, their timing is waaaaay off and the music sounds SO canned.That being said, I havn't actually heard the whole CD but from listening to the clips, its a riot...don't waste your money on this thing unless you want it for the laughs.
__label__1 Got my boots: The quality of the boots weren't the same as in the store. I don't like knock of brands. The glue on the bottom is sticking out. I bought them for my mom for a Christmas present and I'm emberesed give them to her.
__label__1 Nothing in this small book that I didn't already know!: Very small book, not very much information involved here. I can't give this my endorsement! If you know anything about Robert Johnson, you won't need this book!
__label__1 Product doesn't work: I have 4 CD players. Two of them weren't reading well and the CDs were skipping. I bought this product and cleaned all 4 of them. It didn't change anything. This product is a waste of money.
__label__2 Good product: This is a good book. It starts with proving things for measures on the reals and then generalizes to measure spaces.
__label__2 From the Heart: I have worked in the medical field for many years and the knowledge that this author presents about living with this disease is very heart warming. Even for the person with no knowledge of medicine the author puts it all in lay mans terms and does it in a very open and feeling way. With a sense of humor that one would not normally find in a book of this kind. My praises to the author of this very informative book on Parkinsons Disease. A must for every one striken by the disease or a caregiver.
__label__2 A comfort to me during my most difficult trial: I stumbled into this book at the library - about 2 weeks after my wife passed away suddenly - I loved the introduction, and the poems really hit home hard, and really were a comfort - and it seemed that nothing anyone could say was very comforting, but the words through literature was comforting. So after reading this at the library I wanted to make sure I owned a copy of this book as this is a book I'll want to read over and over again. I can't say more about what an excellent collection this is, and of course, It think Garrison Keillor is probably one of the most incredible comic geniuses of our modern era -
__label__1 Not What You Might Expect: I thought Seven Moves by Carol Anshaw was going to be an exciting, mysterious, psychological mystery.It wasn't. I thought the main character Chris Snow would be enduring the dangers of the mid-east in her search for her missing photographer lover, Taylor.She doesn't.This book's goal is actually to attempt to examine the relationship between the two women.However, it doesn't really succeed on any level, including that one.The author never fully tells the reader what happened to Taylor, the woman who disappeared, but she comes close enough you can surmise the answer.The thing I found the most disconcerting in reading this novel, was the fact the author chose to tell the entire book in the present verbal tense, which I found highly annoying, and more than a bit distracting.
__label__1 Junk- Waste of my money!: This Trimmer head is constructed of cheap plastic. It is also not well designed. Where the head anchors to the trimmer there is just a hole on the plastic housing; there is not even a metal sleeve. If it is not thightned properly the hole will widen and the head becomes useless. Also when properly tightened the head slips under load. The spool is mede of very thin plastic and has two sections for each line. The eyes for the lines are attached to a thin housing which then fits inside the head body attached by two plastic clips. After little use the clips loose tension and bottom of the head fall out and if you are using it under full throttle - good luck finding the pieces to reassemble. I will not even rate this product as extra light duty. I have purchased this product to use outside the US and it will cost too much to ship back.
__label__2 Magnífica recopilación de J. Iglesias: En un artista como Julio, no podía faltar una recopilación de su obra.En este CD se resume toda su trayectoria siendo una obra imprescindible para cualquier discoteca.
__label__1 not up to par......not original..........I want a refund: THIS IS A SAD ATTEMPT TO GET IN THE RACE BY USING A TALENTED PRODUCER WITH A MEDIOCRE ARTIST....A CHOCOLATE COVERED T**D IF YOU WILL...CHEAP IMITATION AT POP SONGWRITING IN THE VEIN OF VERTICAL HORIZON, DISHWALLA, THIRD-EYE BLIND...BUT WITHOUT THE DEPTH.IT JUST FALLS SHORT OF TAKING YOU THERE...THE SONGS ARE BETTER SUITED FOR TV SITCOMS OR MAYBE WEDDINGS, ANNIVERSARYS, BAR-MITZVAHS....FUNERALS..GOOD THING FOR AMAZON'S MONEY BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE..
__label__2 Great intro to Spanish cooking: As I have recently become a little obsessed with Spanish food, I decided I needed a decent cookbook. I certainly picked the right one. First, the recipes in this book range from very high brow main courses to simple, easy, delicious tapas. I am starting small and working my way up. Second, the author does an amazing job of explaining Spanish cooking: product definitions, descriptions of the regions and their cuisines, suggestions on cookware selection, etc. I have literally sat for hours reading and looking at the pictures. It was a great purchase and I know I will get a lot of use out of the book.
__label__2 My Mac Mini has 4GB RAM: The Core 2 Duo is only supposed to accept 2 GB of RAM. Mine works great with 4GB. Fusion really likes it!
__label__1 What'd he say?? Yo, 50, stop mumbling!!!!: Ok, so this guy has hot abs and sexy pecs. Thats it. His face, well honestly, looking at his face is downright scary. I KNOW he was shot 9 times and it's really cool he survived, but, they should really avoid putting his face on cd covers. Just show his torso.I might even be able to overlook his face if I understood ONE word he said. The mumbling is REALLY annoying and gets old very fast. He's very monotone and he is not pleasant to listen to. I guess he writes decent lyrics, but who can make out the mumbo jumbo that comes out of his mouth? Anyway, some of the beats are cool (In Da Club would be great without words) but, I have to agree with other reveiwers who hate the self proclaimed "pimps". How lame.Rap music has hit a new low, indeed. I beg of you, buy rap music from the 80's, when rap MEANT something, and avoid buying any "rap album" made after 1990. Thank you.
__label__2 Very Enjoyable: I have been looking for the Rosemary Clooney cut for YEARS! and was so happy that I found it on Amazon. It was very reasonable in price too. I would recommend this light-hearted CD for any child. It has songs on it that will resonate with your child for years to come.Just remember that I have looked for the Choco'lit Rabbit song for decades. It means so much to me that I found it again.Redgirl
__label__1 Not what they used to be.: The price was right, but as always, you get what you pay for. Chicago skates used to be known for quality. Not any longer. The skates I returned were like toys. Larry
__label__2 A clear simple picture: A simple portrait of a Savior. I have recommended and given this book to many. It is awe inspiring how the author can grasp the real Jesus. This book can be read by every religion and culture. For a clear understanding and feeling of a undescribable " Messiah". The author displays a true friendship and love for Jesus. We can all learn from this wonderful little book.
__label__1 terrible thermostat: Terrible thermostat. These are not easy to come by, so I went with it based on its cheap cost. You get what you pay for. It doesn't have any sensitivity to changes in heat, so it's really just a 120V switch.
__label__1 This wire stinks!: This wire stinks! I bought it to save money over the Home Depot product. Boy am I sorry. The welds are totally inferior. The outboard welds are about 50%. This is an example of you get what you pay for. I tried to save a few bucks and it bit me. Cheap really is expensive. Will not buy again.
__label__1 cancer: Written to sell his stuff. I dont know if his stuff helps or not. Would be hard to determine. A lot of info to digest. His stuff is costly.
__label__2 I liked it.: I am suprised at the negative reviews of this book. This was the first Dara Joy book i ever picked up and i loved it, I have defentaly read books by her that were far worse. I thought this book was unique.
__label__1 the iceman: Confessions of a Mafia Hitman: Since the other DVD I purchased at the same time (the iceman interviews), after contacting the author of the book titled "The Ice Man Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer" by Philip Carlo via his email address PCarlo1874@aol.com - as it appears in his book, I discovered to my dismay that this DVD comprised the first two of the three interviews contained in the second DVD. Had this information been contained in the 'description' of the DVD comprising only two interviews then I could have avoided the clear waste of money of buying them twice. The second DVD was all I needed and I could then have purchased something else with the money saved. In short the DVD "the iceman : Confessions of a Mafia Hitman" ought to be removed from publication entirely and only the second DVD "the iceman interviews" (comprising both the interviews of the former DVD together with the third interview of 'The Iceman and the Psychiatrist') remain available for sale.
__label__2 Anchors and Anvils is a superior CD!: Amy Lavere and her band make great music on this CD. It deserves a broad listening audience. For example, if you're a fan of female singer/songwriters with a story to tell, a great voice, and element of sizzle then this is the CD for you. If, on the other hand, you're an admirer of instrumental sublety that complements a vocal centerpiece then this is the CD for you, too. Amy and her band perform a fine selection of songs without being too refined.
__label__2 Great Lens for the price: This Tamron AF70-300 Lens is a perfect lens my Rebel XTi. Pictures are crisp and AF is fast in well lit situations. Not great in low light situations, but thats not what it is priced for.
__label__1 This is a bootlegged version!: Not only is this a bootlegged version with the colors washed out and contrast horrible, it is a really low quality VCD rip which wasn't even upscaled properly and the display resolution of the video feed is tiny!
__label__2 The Perfect Society?: Lois Lowry does not give us the perfect society, she gives us a society of everyday people who have become morally lazy because they live in a comfort zone. I read this book in junior high and loved it. It's a novel about sacrificing emotions, art, and morality for the comfortable life. The characteristics and crimes of this supposed eutopia are intreguing. Lowry has an impressive imagination and vivid writing style. Her original take on the eutopia topic will be well appreciated by everyone from age 11 upwards.
__label__2 Good Headphones: Very good for the price. Needs a bit of EQ, but overall, a really excellent buy. Replacing a broken set.
__label__2 great listening: I've owned the bible on cd made by other people but this version is not in that monotone voice and it more interesting to listen to because it is told like a story with different voices. I would recommend this version to anyone.
__label__1 Sloppy merchandising: The only reason I bought this book was for the compiler. I'd already tried to download and run the free Borland C++ 5.5 compiler with no success. The book refers to the enclosed compiler as being a Turbo C++ Lite. So I bought the book thinking the enclosed compiler would be in a nice, easy to install package, much like Matlab, Autocad, etc. I soon found out that the enclosed compiler was actually the free download of Borland C++ version 5.5 which I can't run on my computer.Very lazy and sloppy packaging. I expect better from a PhD/MBA. I'm thoroughly pissed.
__label__1 lost the complete series: We were completely disappointed with our purchase due to the fact that when we went watch it we received the wrong disk's. We got 2 disk of season 6 disk 2 instead of disk 2 of season 1. And when we tried to get this issue corrected we were unable to get any help.
__label__2 Will this game ship on August 3?: I'm just curious if Amazon will have enough copies of Doom3 to ship out all of the pre-ordered copies the day of the release??? Does anyone know?
__label__1 One glitch ruins all pros: The playmat would be perfect if music did not stop every 20 seconds. It says in the manual to restart it - does not help, baby starts crying. The only thing that helps is hitting the mat - but every 15-20 seconds?? VERY annoying.
__label__1 Uninspiring: I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them. Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful. This book was missing all of that - and then some. The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read. I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died. Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living. Yes it has promise. No - the story line does not deliver. Please don't buy this book. You'll only be disappointed.
__label__1 Couldn't finish it: It is VERY rare for me not to finish any book--especially a murder mystery, but the writing in this one is so quirky, so much calling attention to itself, that after two chapters I just could't take it any more.To indicate on the back cover that: Who's Likely to Like This? included fans of P.D. James.Not bloody likely.
__label__2 The most exciting of hundreds of SF books I've ever read: The thrill, exhilaration, suspense, and goosebump-creating magic of an ancient, lost civilization sending a huge spaceship through the galaxy for some unknown reason was just about as much as I could take. I've read this book a number of times since it first came out. Tragically, the sequels fell flat on their face and were nothing more than parts of a poorly conceived soap opera. I've seen enough tragedy in real life. SF should be an escape from that, not a slide into the depths of it. Besides, I find it inconceivable that the creator of the universe would have to infest his creation with nodes and prime monitors in order to keep track of what is going on. If God can create the universe, he surely knows how to create one that is in Harmony with itself, if he/she so chose to.
__label__2 Interesting Format, Fascinating Reading: The book uses a day-by-day approach to the story, quoting and paraphrasing first-hand references--diaries and reports of people on the scene. I found it very readable and interesting. Lots of good info and tidbits.One complaint--and for me a big one--NO INDEX. It should be against the law to publish an historical book like this with no index. This makes it difficult to use as as serious reference work.
__label__1 Horrible: I love V.C. Andrew's books. However, this book is horrible. I can't even get through the whole book. It's super slow paced and very boring.
__label__1 DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS: I came across the product and Amazon and bought it because of all the glowing positive reviewsAfter using about a half dozen times, I am very skeptical of this product and the people writing the positive reviews for it.First, it has a REALLY STRONG fragrance (what I call odor) which smells like CHEAP PERFUME OR CHEAP COLOGNE. And the smell doesn't go away. If you put it on in the morning, you can smell it all day into the evening and I am sure others can to. If you don't like the smell of cheap perfume or cologne, you probably won't like this.Second, it doesn't do anything in terms of conditioning or moisturizing hair. I noticed no difference, positive or negative, after putting it on consistently.Third, it is greasy and annoying to have in your hair unless you are used to it.Overall, I recommend a good conditioner instead. If you want leave-in treatment, try Infusium 23 Leave-In Treatment (which is much lighter, minimal fragrance, and actually conditions).
__label__1 Not the real thing: Years ago I used to buy Diorissimo from France, I simply loved that perfume...the scent would last all day ...Sadly this new Diorissimo I just bought is not at all the product I remember...the scent will last for 1/2 hour or less...it is not worth the money I paid for..I would not recommend it to anyone who knows good perfume and appreciate them
__label__2 Still is use!: I bought this case many years ago for my daughter's 1st generation nano. Athough the nano has long been replaced by a newer generations, case is still being used! Not the nano skin, mind you, the big case which holds the nano and earbuds and charger! A good sturdy product. We have been pleased.
__label__1 No Ending & No More Charlie: This season is cut short without an ending after only 16 episodes. Now that Charlie has been fired, there is no way to end the season or the series properly. Just like Charlie Harper, the cool babe hound who was turned by the producers into a stumbling wimpy drunk, this once mighty comedy is now a weak sitcom.
__label__2 Best 2 cd on spanish, easy to follow: First of all, If you think this is hard to follow/understand, then I will bet you will never learn NO matter what program you get. Did negative revierws really expect to learn spanish( or any language) by listening to 2 cds ?!!!!!. Thomas did a great job of introuding people to language essentials, common words, and practical use of verbs. Not only that but you will end up with confidence to start practising and speak the language(in a limite way).Great learning program for people to start with. I found out I could borrow the cds from many public libraries, which is what I did. I would say this is the best 4 hour-series I have come across. Knowing thousands of words will not do you any good till you start putting them into practical use (which is what Thomas teaching you to do).
__label__1 You could spend less and get a real aquarium: A tank this small should only be used for a Betta fish. Any other fish will need a good filter, heat, and oxygenation. And still it is way to small to even be worth it. My advice to you is to save your money, and go buy a 10 gallon kit and have that as your starter aquarium. Then you can keep some realy fish. Also goldfish should be kept in at least a 30 gallon aquarium, so i even if you get a 10 gallon, please research the fish before you buy them.
__label__1 Great idea but ....: This reusable filter is a great idea to save money (buying all those prepackaged coffee K cups) and to eliminate a lot of trash. Ok it's sort of a pain to clean out the grounds from the screen, but certainly do-able. BUT the plastic rim breaks off after limited use. PLEASE make a better quality, longer lasting item!
__label__1 Not Worth It: This season is deff weak, not worth it at all. i seen season 7 and at least thats a lil bit better. But im not gonna front the last two season have really gone down since Tony Childs left!
__label__1 OK to read if you have nothing else better to do.: Da Vinci Code was fascinating and I was expecting another good read, but was sorely disappointed. I don't totally blame Dan Brown - the publishing company unearthed this obviously older novel to piggy-back on Mr. Brown's current popularity. It was terribly out of date and full of holes.
__label__1 Not worth the Money: While I was looking forward to using this gps I was disappointed in the accuracy it showed both in pace per mile and distance run. It was very inaccurate and inconsistent. I've used it for several months and have given up on it's accuracy. According to Garmin the models above this one have a better GPS system. This one is a waste of money it doesn't do anything you want it to.
__label__2 The best CD: What can you say about this band? They are utterly incredible. I would love to use all the same adjectives that everyone else has used (read: scary, depressing, sad) but I don't see it as that. At most, I see it as dark. But like everyone has said, it's a journey, a journey that ends with a question mark, and a blank space, that you must fill with your own feelings. As for the intermissions... I don't care about them. "Message to Harry Manback" is GREAT... "Dier Von Satan" is awesome if looked at from a different perspective. It shows how simple minded most of us are. Anyway, GREAT CD... There isn't one that is better. Bottom line. Oh yeah, and being from Colorado, I ESPECIALLY love the song Aenima :o)
__label__2 just the perfect gift: this was the perfect gift she loved it cant stop making ice cream the freezer is filled like an ice cream parlor
__label__1 What is this?: Based on previous Baggallini purchases, I was looking forward to receiving this organizer. However, when I opened the packet, my first questions were: 1. how do you wear / use this thing; and 2. why doesn't it close? Totally useless purchase. I am returning it tomorrow morning. A disappointment, especially how great the other Baggallini bags are.
__label__1 Lasted Four Months: This MP3 player was a very good price/performance choice. My platform of choice for loading it is my Ubuntu Linux desktop, but it worked equally well from Windows. At 2Gb, it held all my current podcasts plus a couple of audio books.Unfortunately, one month past the warranty expiration, the device expired. It will no longer boot, nor does it turn on when plugged in to a USB port.
__label__2 On the Way: This is kind of a transitional album. Shania's first album, the one before this, was in the country vein. She begins the transition to country/pop and country/rock that came to real fruition in Come on Over, the album after this one. This album isn't quite the blockbuster that its successor is, but still very good. Very good tunes:Any Man of MineI'm Outta HereWhose Bed Have Your Boots Been UnderNo One Needs to Know
__label__2 The KING returns!: OK, This is not the greatest KING DIAMOND release, but it is far from the worst. "House Of God" has a much more "rock" sound on the album, especially due to the drums. This is very melodic and also very catchy. Lyric wise King sticks to his story theme, which is very enjoyable. If you are a King Diamond fan you will enjoy this like any other King album, if you are a new fan go buy "Abigail" or "Fatal Portrait" first, then get this!
__label__2 OK...to make it simple: the machine is COOL: It's simple to operate, convenient in size, and saves trips to the local snow cone shop.What more can one ask?
__label__1 Who designed this?: Seriously, did they not test this product before mass producing it? What good is a cupcake holder that allows your cupcakes to tip over? The holes for the cupcakes only effectively prevent cupcakes from sliding while you're walking (carefully). I found this out the hard way on the way to a friend's daughter's birthday (for which I made the cupcakes). After the first gentle turn in my car, all of the cupcakes fell over. They were squished. Luckily, I only used one of these holders, and the other 36 cupcakes were OK. Don't wast your money...go for the Cupcake Courier (holds 36 cupcakes) with deep holes that the cupcakes sit in.
__label__2 The Champagne of Spicy Mustard: Been with me since a child in the fifties.... and drank my orange soda in the mini-mug that it was packaged in
__label__1 This game ...: This is a very dumb game. It is so unrealistic the penaltys the refs call arent even right the player he called the penalty on didnt even do anything after I reviewed the play. When you have 4 wide recievers and you pass it to one all of a sudden theres 5 guys covering him. You have to have it on easy in order to have fun with the game. When you pick a classic team all the players are black. Sometimes when you go to takle the people you just slip right off of them like thier a bar a soap then they run all the way for a touchdown. I recommend that you do not waste your money on this. I hope the other Madden games arent like Madden 99.
__label__1 Incredibly poorly made: After 15 years, my Atlas pasta machine gave up the ghost, so I replaced it with this one. What a mistake. The directions state that you should run a batch of dough through the machine to remove any residual grit left over from factory assembly. But, the amount of machine oil and dirt being removed was incredible. I ran two batches through and was still found large amounts of oil and dirt coming out. Further, the dough began sticking to the machine and wouldn't go through fully. I don't know if this was due to the amount of residual factory oil in the machine or not, but it made a real mess. I spent about 1/2 hour with a toothpick cleaning it out.Worse, during the second batch I noticed that chrome was flaking off the rollers.At that point, I gave up and returned the machine. I've since gone and bought another Atlas pasta maker. After running dough through it once, I seem to have gotten all the factory dirt out, and it's working just fine now.
__label__1 Music for TV commercials and Movie soundtracks: Want your jeans/soft drink commercial to appear "cool"? Just pick a track from this "indie-rock-music-by-numbers" album!I have heard this album at work a zillion times. It irritated me at first, then it bored me and now I hope I never hear it again.Yes, this is rock music eating itself / rock music as a cover version of itself / rock music as an extension of corporate rock culture.Verdict? Tedious, dull and predictable.
__label__1 WASTE OF MONEY: I am 5'7" weighing 145 lbs. My ideal weight is between 130-135 lbs so I decided to try this product. It didn't do a thing! Didn't supress my appetite. It simply didn't have any effect whatsoever. So save your money and don't buy this junk.
__label__2 Hooked by Groove Armada: Just happened to be watching a TV show featuring The Who, this "set-up" band played first. I was instantly hooked by the beat and mix of instrument sounds of "Easy", then really snagged by "Superstlylin'". Just based on hearing these 2 cuts, prompted me to buy this album "in the dark". And Groove Armada did NOT disappoint - I loved nearly every track on the CD. New, exciting, sophisticated - it's hard to believe that all the arrangements are performed by the sane group.
__label__2 Part of the Great Tradition of Scandinavian Mysteries: Maj Sowal and Per Wahloo were able to create the European version of the great American police procedurals. The protagonist is a convincing policeman filled with the doubts and depressions that go with dealing with humankind's worst behavior
__label__1 This book is useless....: This book was required for my CSC 301 "Distributed Software Systems" course in college. I would get alot of programming assignments and try to use the book as a reference to learn the syntax of the language, but, there are virtually no examples to look at and learn from. Maybe when I'm at a more advanced level with JavaScript, I'll appreciate it more, however, right now I'm giving it two thumbs way down.If you are a beginner to JavaScript, this book is not for you. Even if you have some programming coursework under your belt, this book is not for you. I've taken alot of programming courses and never really had any problems finding answers to my questions, but, I look through this book and I can't find the answers I'm looking for.Don't waste your money on this book.
__label__1 not so great: I bought this bag as a replacement for one that was stolen, and was hoping it would be similar because it's the same price. It doesn't have as many pockets, and the canvas is not as ridged so it feels floppy when you're trying to get into it. Also, the stitching that holds the strap on started coming undone after a few days. It looks pretty cool though, and the pen holders in the front flap is a good feature, which earned this bag one more star. On the whole though, I would recommend a different bag, like the heavyweight classic messenger bag. It's sturdier and a better design for organization.
__label__2 AMAZINGLY MODERN YIDDISH-ENGLISH POETRY: WE WERE OVERWHELMED BY THE ORIGINALITY OF CONTENT AND STYLE....MENKE KATZ IS A MAGNIFICENT POET AND THE BOOK MAKES AVAILABLE HIS WORK IN EXCELLENT TRANSLATIONS BY THE HARSHAVS. THE INTRODUCTION BY PROF. DOVID KATZ IS A TREASURE UNTO ITSELF. FRANK HANDLER
__label__2 THE HOUSE OF ATREUS: DAVID DEFEIS AND VIRGIN STEELELAYETH THE SMACK DOWN WITH AN EPIC OF TALES. THE MUSIC OPENS ANOTHER DOOR TO THE HARD ROCK AND HEAVY METAL COMMUNITY THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED FOR TOO LONG. EXCELLENT PRODUCTION! HEAVY GUITARS! GREAT MIX OF BASS GUITAR AND DRUMS! DAVID DEFEIS IS SINGING BETTER THAN EVER. THIS IS A VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT DRAMA FROM START TO FINISH. I CAN NOT WAIT FORPART 2.
__label__2 Warlords DVD: Very Good movie to have, is a Rare Collection Item.Now it has a place in my DVD Collection Room.
__label__2 The battery works: We received the battery very quickly, just a few days. It was not packaged as shown, but came in a plain plastic bag. That is fine as it is the battery that we need, not the package. I just think that she should have used a picture of the battery as it would be a picture of what we were to receive. It would have been more accurate. It might have been a problem if this was a gift.I charged the battery up and it works fine. How many years will it work? I can tell you that in a few years, but so far it is working just fine. The price was very good. An original Canon battery was much more. I only wish that Amazon would not take such a high percentage of the shipping as it was more than the battery.
__label__2 The Real Phil Collins Talent!: I had this record back in the seventies and will be buying it again!One: You will be astounded by what an excellent drummer Phil Collins is!Two: Goodsall and the rest of the players on this record are astounding.Three: This will still sound fresh today! Nothing cliche' on this record.This Brand X is just plain good, supurbly executed Jazz/Rock/fusion! To be honest this one is sooooo good, there is nothing else that Brand X ever did that even came close. Awesome Spin!
__label__1 SEALs are warriors: Dick Couch is a former SEAL. He loves the SEALs. This book is a good look(although limited)at modern-day SEALs. If you have never read a book about SEALs then this is an excellent place to start. This book is very informative. If you have read alot or know alot about the SEALs then skip the first 38 pages. The author really loves the SEALs. Did I mention that? On one page alone(small pages) the word SEAL is mentioned 16 times. Dick Couch is a good, not great, writer and is very detailed and I was really enjoying his book until I read his account, on page 183, of a close-quarters firefight in which he describes how good these particular SEALs could shoot because they had shot the bad guys weapon and his hands holding the weapon. This may have impressed Mr. Couch or maybe he is just trying to impress the reader, but that is not good shooting skill. This isn't an old TV western. That paragraph really made me wonder about the whole book. Fiction? Non-fiction?
__label__2 Exceptional: Karen Marie Moning has done it again. An exception reading experience, and a book I know I'll be re reading soon.
__label__1 Not in as good of condition as I expected: I normally ask for very good condition of a book, maybe good also. So, I assume that is what I asked for when I ordered this book. It was not in very good or good condition. There was a ton of writing in it and some of the pages were coming out. I love the contents of the book though and can still read it, so I am thankful for that. I just would have had this book listed as fair quality instead of good or very good.
__label__2 Beautiful!: I ordered rubbed bronze, and it looks exactly as pictured: a very dark, almost black brown, with satin coppery highlights which are especially prominent around the edge of the top. Perfect match to the rubbed bronze Talis C faucets I ordered.
__label__1 WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN: Loved the 1st Boondock Saints but this was the worst movie I have ever seen! Atrocious writing and acting that was (I am hoping) trying to be camp but came across as high school amateurish. My previous worse movie ever was Hang Up or Hanging Up - a piece of dreck starring Meg Ryan and that blonde chick from Friends - Boondock Saints 2 is actually much much worse than that.Save yourself the money and time and just stare at a wall for an hour and a half - your life would be more enriched than sitting through this POS.
__label__2 excellent introduction to Talmud!: I checked this book out from a library and was impressed enough to want a copy. With the understanding that no book could condense the entirety of the Talmud into a small volume and maintain the full discourses on the expounding of jewish law, this is as close as I've found on the subject. I am told the Talmud can be a book that you can study for a lifetime. This book as the "Everyman's Talmud" is not the Talmud of the rabbinical godal but a short summation of an exhaustive study and can give you quite a feel for the fullness of the work. As a christian I hope this has given me a more complete view of rabbinical law. I feel it has, and would recommend it.
__label__1 Too Many Carbohydrates: I was given this book during a diabetes education class. I'm sorry, but eating as many carbohydrates as this book recommends is not helpful to diabetics. If I ate one serving of most recipes, my blood glucose would shoot way up. I guess if you are looking to keep the pharmaceutical industry in business, this is a good way.
__label__2 Better than the rest: Hello? They should be throwing book awards at this woman. Her novel is entertaining, but also as "deep" as the ponderous ones that advertise themselves as such. She is a light in the thick mediocrity of today's "literary" world. Some celebrated authors write great sentences or paragraphs. But Heidi J S writes a great BOOK.
__label__1 SICK MAN JUST WANT TO MAKE MONEY AND FAME ....THATS ALL: he is just a new juggler first who have checked the narrow thinking of left wing and now he is playing with them and making money and fame .he is a bad and coward dectator who just want to talk talk and talk who dont want to listen any body's views if somebody is aggreing with him he can talk with him more then one minit in his show but is somebody is disagree with him then he will abuse him and dont let him talk more then 20 sec because he is too affraid of truithYou can listen his show and can realise very easily that he is dictator and dont want to listen the views of his apponents.how can somebody justify his views with listining his apponents.think about it.
__label__1 Beware win7 64 bit: This adapter does not work with Windows 7 64 bit. Disregard the compatibility list, it is worthless. So far I have purchased and returned 3 adapters and none of them have worked with windows 7 64 bit. Linksys AE1000, Belkin n300 micro, and this Trendnet, none of which have worked. I even tried to use drivers made by the chipset manufacturers with no luck.
__label__2 AT&T Retirement Party Door Prize: We purchased two of these DVDs for door prizes at a movie themed, retirement party for two AT&T employees...great, inexpensive way to tie the party together and reward guests!
__label__2 Good Value & Great Storage Cases: I've converted over 200 CD's now to MD and I am sold on the Memorex Cool Color 20 packs. They are a great value and the storage cases are excellent for organizing, storing, and travel. The quality of the MD's is as good as any I've used, but case is what makes it a truly outstanding buy!
__label__2 Works fine . . . no problems: I have two of these switches, I'm running four PCs from two monitors and two keyboard/mouse combinations. I haven't had any ghosting problems at all (using NEC and KDS monitors), although I had another model (TK-206I) from Trendnet (USB rather than PS/2 connections) that I used with a iMac (since retired) and PC that did have some very minor ghosting problems.This is a great solution if you have limited desk space or just don't want to have multiple monitors running at one time. The switch looks nice and the hot-key switchover is almost instantaneous.
__label__1 Never got item: I would love to review this ring, but it never arrived. The ring was intended for a friend as a gift, but the address it was sent to turned out to be wrong, and the item did not forward. I emailed Old Glory twice and explained the problem, figuring the ring must have been returned by the postal service but got no response of any kind. I am now trying to get a refund via Amazon.com, who also have not yet responded. Apparently I am just out the $22 and shipping for a ring that neither my friend nor I ever received. While I appreciate that there was a problem with the address at my end, I have not been able to get as much as a response from Old Glory as to whether or not they got the ring back. I will not purchase another item from Old Glory.
__label__1 Great until . . .: the blue "dots" appear. I've had this about a year-and-a-half and the entire left side of the screen becomes a blue smimmer of varying translucency after about 1-2 hours of use. This has started to spread to the middle and top of the screen and is ruining the experience of watching anything. Anyone have any advice? Samsung customer service said they never heard of this, but it seems that I'm not the only one with this problem (and no more warranty). YIKES!
__label__2 Funnier Than Previous Dunham Material: Spark of Insanity was far funnier than any previous shows in Which I have seen Jeff Dunham and his puppets. Contrary to the one negative opinion I have read about the performance, I didn't have to gauge the reactions of audience members to know when it was time to laugh. It was very funny, and I must say that his tackling an issue, such as terrorism, with comedy, was funnier than I would have even thought it would be. Dunham is a very talented ventriloquist, with a fine sense of comedic timing. I feel sorry for anyone who can't get a laugh out Spark of Insanity, their sense of humor is irreparably broken. Buy it, see it, enjoy it!
__label__1 Disappointing: Maybe my hopes for this product were too high, but I was let down by these peppermint capsules.I didn't have any trouble with them dissolving too early and causing the weird stomach cooling that I read about in the cases of others, but I also didn't find any relief from my predictable IBS symptoms. I tried taking them at various times during the day, and in higher doses, but it was no use.Of course, the fact remains that there are very good reviews for this product out there-- clearly peppermint oil capsules can work for some. Just not me, unfortunately.
__label__1 An abomination: It was just a matter of time before the sharks came out to infest the DVD world with inferior "product" like they did a couple of decades back with VHS. There's a new rule in my house: if the name Platinum Disc Corporation is on the box, avoid purchasing the same way you avoid disease. No care has been taken to obtain good prints, the visuals are murky and the sound choppy, the constant corner bug to let you know what miserable company is responsible for the mess (PIP...what does that stand for? shouldn't it be PDC? Did they change their name? After their latest batch of releases, an even newer name change should be in order, if they are to ever get any one to buy their junk releases.)Don't let the bright, attractive packaging fool you. Buyer beware! And by all means, film buffs beware!
__label__2 Works well - switches in inconvenient spot: This hair dryer works fine. It has several settings that are good as well. The only problem that I see with the hairdryer is that the switches are located on the handle and as your hand wraps around to hold the dryer, you inadvertently shut it off. It's annoying but I feel as though it's just something I will get used to in time. Everything else about it is --- so far, so good.
__label__1 high blood pressure reading: This product gave me consistant high blood pressure readings. I am no longer using it on advice from my physician. I was unable to return the product due to the seller's terms. Amazon merely was a middle-man and at no fault.
__label__1 Some Good Songs but I'd Recommend Other Musicals: Ok, I bought the CD because I heard a great song from this musical, "Feelings You've Got to Hide" (it wasn't even that good after listening to it again.) There were both positives to the CD and negatives. First the postivies: Alice Ripley and Emily Skinner have amazing voices and there are some great songs such as "I will Never Leave You". Now the negatives: the show did not live up to the potential it had. The two lead girls did not use the power in their voice that I would have like to have heard. The two lead males did not have the best voices (that is my personal opinion) as well. The lyrics were not that good and the story seemed forced. Other than a few good songs the musical was not that good and just was not the type of musical I enjoy. I would recommend musicals such as Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera, Wicked, Avenue Q, etc. or musicals that has more than 7 songs you enjoy. There are good musicals but this just isn't one of them.
__label__1 A singer with no voice: The title of this album is deeply ironical, for the singer has little voice! His narrow range and unformed technique are both an embarrassment. Naturally, he fails to do justice to the music. A one-star recording.
__label__2 Good reference for Calc course work: You need both this andCalculus II For Dummiesto complete Calc course for reference and self-study guide. It provide great examples and techniques to solve problems and a great help !! I think they did a great job of making life easier for a calc stuff for either reference or class use.
__label__2 Simple: Very very simple. Materials are not top quality but very durable and does the job it needs to do. This is definitely worth the money.
__label__2 A Sensual Caress For Your Mind: Vincent Tyler speaks with the words of a man who knows what it takes to please a woman! The journey can be quit pleasurable for us women if we are open to being taken to the secret places we thought existed only in our minds.And for you brothers who may read this review, take note, apply what you read and see if it makes a difference.
__label__1 Misses somewhere: The premise of the book was interesing...a man finding himself through the exploration of his brother's life. But it lost my attention somewhere. I put the book down for a couple weeks and then finally finished the last chapter. The beginning of the book was compelling and moving. However, by the end, I just didnt care about the outcome. The author, in my opinion, while he tries, did not fully convey how he was able to move on.As others have stated, i tried to like this book, but couldnt.
__label__1 Not for dummies - Hard to load blade: Bought this and returned it promptly. On paper, a good product. But hard to load the blade. Despite a few tutorials online. Won't offer suggestions on how to, since don't think I was really successful. The blade kept sliding out.And frankly, a bit dangerous design. The storage for extra blades pops out and the blades inside jump around. Imagine if they fly out into your face. Secondly, the blade is such an effort to load while pinching the blade, that I kept thinking, I might cut myself up at some point.Bought at HD and cost me about $9 plus taxes.
__label__1 Not a deterrent: Product does trigger as expected and the red light goes on. But then I tried this on a real live cat. The cat was not bothered by the sound even after we triggered it multiple times. Cat just played with it. How is this expected to repel feral cats?
__label__2 Better than I know myself: I bought this book and forgot I had it. When I came across it aqain, I couldn't put it down. Carmen, Regina,and Jewel were three characters that you adopt into your life as their lives unfold. Three women with different life experiences came together as friends and ultimately sisters. I love how they were loyal and loving during the good times and bad. Carmen was a quiet storm of strength and courage, Regina was a burst of energy and determination that sometimes led her astray, and Jewel had a elegant dignity of class that exemplified love and compassion for her freinds. You become a part of these three women lives and feel there losses and accomplishments. I am so glad I picked this book up to read, a must read...
__label__1 Almost fried my hard drive: I bought this to access an old hard drive that had important documents. The minute I turned the power on from the switch in the power cord, smoke started rising from the circuitry at the bottom of the hard drive. Luckily, I quickly unplugged. I ended purchasing a USB 2 hard disk enclosure from a local store at about $21 (after taxes). I was able to access the data and copy it to other drives.
__label__2 not your average board game: i love rush hour junior even though i am 12. Normallly when you get a junior game it is sort of a waste of money because it is nothing like the original game but rush hour junior is exactly what it should be a junior game of rush hour. i would definetly reccomend this for younger kids. i even had a blast playing this game!
__label__1 Weakest TOTO effort. These guys are better than this.: I have been a TOTO fan since the beginning, and hold the band to a very high standard. While I certainly can't knock the talent and musicianship on the album, finding an album of cover songs was a big disappointment. Talk about setting yourself up for failure. With few exceptions, the originals far surpass TOTO's attempts at reinterpretation. These are some of the greatest songs in rock history! The renditions of Could You Be Loved, Living For The City and Sunshine Of Your Love are admirable, but the straight covers of Bodhisattva and Burn Down The Mission are best left to the original masters. And Luke, please, what were you thinking trying to do Elvis. Poor execution of what could have been a funny goof. Kingdom, Tambu, Mindfields were awesome - and now that Kimball is back, I want more original material. Not bad as a stand alone collection, but only worth two stars compared to the rest of their catalog.
__label__2 Works good: "Paint" goo and hang orb on tree. Works like a fly trap."Wash" off with mineral spirits and use again.We have children that play around our apple trees, and are trying to stay as chemical free as possible.We have an orb on each tree and each orb has caught 100's of bugs.Probably will be buying more to catch even more.
__label__2 Great classic Casio digital in a value case and strap.: The chip and movement are the same as in the most famous classic G-Shock, which is overpriced. This little watch is light, inexpensive, and reliable.
__label__2 Desert Island Album: Reading the other reviews, it sounds as though we're preaching to the converted. Anyhow, this album stands as one of my all-time faves and would definitely make it into my top 5 to bring along with me onto a desert island (provided that island had a CD player and some power source; hmmm, maybe I'd just bring along a satellite phone instead)
__label__1 Slower than Molasses Going Uphill: I've used McAfee software for years and, although recent version have had some problems, had no qualms about purchasing their Internet Security Suite 2007. BIG mistake!!! It took 4-1/2 hours to scan a 20GB hard drive! Very user unfriendly suite. Help file not very helpful. Web site is nos better. I'll keep looking through help and on the 'net to see if I can find out how to speed it up. The firewall initially blocked me from using Eudora, although I had granted it full access. I uninstalled a trial version of CA, and Norton Systems Works, to install this junk.
__label__1 a displeased choral fan: As one would expect from Bernstein, this is a technically well done performace on the orchestra's part. However, a choral conductor he is not, and the chorus' work in this recording lacks a great deal. Both the Kyrie and Jesu Christe are ponderous where they should be intense, and the ...Sancto is disjointed rather than dancing through the runs. The Qui Tollis has wretched balance between the double choirs, and the chorus in the Gloria is overridden by an intrusive bass drum.As an alternative, I recommend John Eliot Gardiner's recording with the Monteverdi Choir. The solos could perhaps be improved, but the choral movements are unmatched by any other recording.
__label__1 It tries but is small: This unit does pull a little moisture out of the air, but won't dry a very large space. But is also works as a white noise machine if you just need a bit of moisture control. We bought a regular full-size dehumidifier for our RV and use it as an end table.
__label__2 awesome: I have been trying to buy this for months thanks for having onegreat value and you seem to have all the golden oldes
__label__2 Amazing Camera: I brought the camera for my parents.... and they are loving this smart machine .......... the picture quality is amazing and the camera is handy too ............ the only flaw that I see in this camera is the video quality .......... i am not too satisfied with it.......... say i would give 7 out of 10 for video ............ beyond that ...... must buy item ........... the battery life is good too .......... the preset modes is a big help ....... you don't have to play around with the settings........ it sets it all for you ............ the camera weighs less......... the AV chord helps you view the picture and videos on TV ....... overall i would rate 9 out of 10 ........
__label__2 A great read.: An insightful account of Teddy Roosevelt's little publicized 1913 expedition to the Amazon basin. Great character development and a wealth of information on the natives, topography, flora and fauna of the region.
__label__1 Does not work well: The boys, ages 4 and 6, loved it but it is basically just a megaphone and only has a slight voice change despite the option of 8 different voices. It's not very durable and basically just amplifies their voices which is why they love to play with it. It was cheap so not THAT much of a disappointment.
__label__1 Booster seat carrying bag: I purchased this carrying bag along with a Compass Booster seat, mostly for use during airline travel. The seat fits into the bag quite well. The reason for my 2 star rating is that the material (nylon and zipper) used to construct the bag seem very lightweight and flimsy and in my opinion it will only be a matter of time before the bag rips or the zipper fails. For the $20 price tag, I expected more durable materials.
__label__2 Comedy, thy name is Dane!: Dane Cook is simply the funniest comedian touring today, and this DVD proves it! Dane's energetic stand-up draws you in and rocks your skull. His routines make you beg for more as you are sprawled out on the floor, gasping for air thanks to your uncontrollable laughter. This DVD is hilarious, simply hilarious!!
__label__1 YUK! What Happened?: I used to have a Eureka Optima Vacuum (red) in a slightly different model, that worked beautifully. I have now tried this model (431DX) for the second time and I'm returning it. Why? It cleans well. It looks good. It's compact. It has strong suction. All the things I liked with my first Optima. But this one has a terrible odor when you vacuum. I can see this happening if you've had your vacuum for awhile or fail to clean the filter, but this is brand new out of the box. What is going on here? My son just walked in the house and wanted to know what the awful smell was....needless to say, all the doors are open to air out the house. Thank goodness for Amazon's great customer service on returns.
__label__2 Expect the unexpected!: This is one of Van Halen's best displays of their truely incredible talent.(Don't try and typecast this band... otherwise you may not enjoy this)They show they can do it all, hard rock, vocals, even swing jazz! (If you haven't heard "Big Bad Bill" it is really well done and nothing like you've ever heard them do before. Eddie's dad does the clarient solos-- you can see that talent runs in the family and across the generations...)They do covers and truely make them their own as well as performing several of their own tracks in their usual "blow your doors off" style...Loved it when it first came out and it still sounds GREAT today.
__label__2 Abbie's My Side of the Moutain Review: The book , My Side of the Moutain by Jean Creighead George, is an exellent book. This book will take you into a world of excitment, and adventures.The book is about a boy who is about 13 years old. His name is Sam Gribley. Sam runs away from his small apartment in New York City. Sam runs away in search of his Grandfather Gribley's farm in the Catskill Moutains.In many ways Sam is an overachiver. He learns how to live off the land, he trains a falcon, and he also makes friends with a weasel and a raccoon!I would recommend this book for anyone in the 4-6 grade. This book is exciting and kids won't want to stop reading it.This book is about a boy bbut it is an excellent book for a girl also!!!
__label__2 Simply beautiful.: I recently purchased the peek-a-pooh bedding set and think that it is absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vivid and eye catching. I would recommend this comforter set.
__label__1 Hard Part To Find: Nobody makes a 14" rear wheel anymore. Glad this site had one. Being hard to find = high price. But had no choice.......
__label__1 Disappointing: From the title I would have expected some information about the innovative design details of these aircraft. Instead each chapter delivers a very superficial operational history and a list of the aircraft's varients. The drawings are profiles and the technical descriptions are basic lists of specifications. It would have been nice to see a description of how the state of the art was advanced by each of these aircraft. In summary this book has a misleading title and offers nothing new in the way of insights or information.
__label__2 Underrated boxing movie: I have loved Diggstown since I first saw it as a kid. I don't know why I waited so long to get the DVD. Sure, it's cheesey in parts, but it's overall just a great boxing movie and really fun. Is it Rocky? Of course not, but it doesn't set out to be. It balances comedy and drama very well, so the few serious/dramatic parts really hit home without taking away from how funny the rest of the movie. And the ending is great. If I saw the movie for the first time now, I might be find it obvious, but I remember being completely surprised when I first saw it, and I still love it to this day.
__label__2 Nice product: The headset is easy to install and is very simple to use. It is great when riding at lower speeds, but speakers could be louder highway speeds. It may just be my helmet though. I have recommended this product to others.
__label__1 Why?: Why is there no digital download for this anywhere except for iTunes Ireland. I hate iTunes but I'd use it to buy this, except it won't let me because I'm in the US. This is a great movie but shame on the producers for not making this easily available for purchase.
__label__1 Usually a fan, but unimpressed: Let me start by saying I love Agathie Christie, she's one of my guilty pleasures. There's nothing cosier that sitting in a lovely warm living room reading an Christie novel while it's raining outside.That being said, this novel is very odd and uninspiring. It's not one of her typical murder mysteries...and it's all very farfetched and just barely comes together in the end.Fans of her usual material might seem a bit baffled by this 'novel'. This probably would have made a fine screenplay...but there's not enough coherence or guts to it, to make it a good novel as such. The characters also, are rather forgettable. The climax to the novel as well, is all rather odd and unimpressive.A fast read notheless.
__label__2 A Great Decision!: After trying out RCA and Sony wireless headphones (& being disappointed), I went on the web and started reading reviews. The more I read, the more I wanted to try out a set of Sennheisers so I did. After a month of use, I am still very pleased with the RS-120. Yes, there is an ever-so-slight background hiss if you listen really for it but for TV use, they're super! It was a good decision...
__label__1 Normally ZERO stars: This is unbearable plastic pop from german Diva Rosenberg - with worst singing. She can do it better and did it in the past. Music very low without any glimpse of inspiration.
__label__1 BEWARE-This is NOT God's Word-It is Deceiving: The book is just another tool in the hands of Satan. Peterson has done what God warns all who read His Word not to do at the end of the Bible in Revelation and also in the Old Testament, in other words, not to add or delete ANY of His Word. This man does just that. I would urge all who are considering buying this to stop and NOT buy it. It is leading to false beliefs and even calling this "The Message Bible" is FALSE. God's Word is not something to be taken lightly or changed to suit your purposes or to make it "easy to understand" . If you really want to understand the Bible, pick up a REAL Bible: King James, ESV, NIV, but NOT this utter distortion which will lead you astray. This is FALSE, FALSE, FALSE. Buy a real Bible and ask the Lord to open its meaning up to you.
__label__1 Pah.: Also, the book itself is complete crud, being nothing more tangible than one would expect to find in the National Enquirer.
__label__2 Best Value for Money: I really love this camera. It has almost all the features that we expect today as a casual photographer. I tried several night shots in Manhattan and they showed up very clear.This model has an improved LCD display that projects more energy into the picture and so the picture looks very clear. The best part is "Digital Macro" feature that helps shoot the objects from 2CM to 50CM. I shot some flowers in my garden and they came awesome.We tried Casio 10 mega pixel camera on the same subject with close up shot, but the picture quality of Canon is far more superior.For anyone who is looking for a sleek camera which is fully packed with features, this is the best bet.
__label__2 gutter bracket: I had a hard time finding equipment locally. It was nice to find someone who had the correct brackets & connectors
__label__2 why you should add this CD to your collection: I just returned (Wednesday, Sept. 29), from one of the most brilliant concerts I have ever witnessed! As per usual, most of us "oldies" wanted to hear the old stuff, Aqualung, etc., but I found the new CD, and the cuts he played live to be outstanding. It's definatly worth the price, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for oldies, buy one of the earlier outings. This one's a keeper.
__label__2 Great Information; Terrible Color charts & pictures: I thought the book was good but I am disappointed in the color charts and the pictures in the book. The before and after pictures were in b&w so you missed out on seeing the full effect of the makeover. The color charts in the book were very poorly done, the colors were not clear or easy to recognize. Color theory is very important and I think more care should have been put into this chapter.
__label__2 I love wind chimes: This chime is loud and perfect. I hear it all night which is what I wanted. It makes a beautiful sound and well made.
__label__2 Just right for the money: This shop dust collector is just right for a small shop where it will be "working" on one machine at a time. We have actually used it with two machines at the same time and it does an OK job. But with one machine working it has plent of pull.For the price I don't think you'll find a better dust collector.
__label__1 Audio Version is Unbearable: I can't actually review the book itself because I couldn't listen to the whole thing. The reason I stopped was the excruciatingly inept reading of George Wilson. I managed to get through the first CD but when I looked at how many more I would have to endure, I just couldn't do it. I packed it away and tried to forget about how much money I'd spent on something so awful.George Wilson reads with all the enthusiasm of a coma patient on Quaaludes. Add to that his incongruous accents, and it's simply more than one should have to face. I've listened to hundreds of books and I know I've never heard his voice before. It's so shockingly bad that his name will forever be the scarlet letter to mark audiobooks to pass by. I'm still stunned that a major publishing company would allow this to be released. It would be the equivalent of releasing the printed version with no punctuation. You might be able to slog through it, but would it really be worth the effort?
__label__2 Still relevant: This book is certainly of its time, and the rapid development of computer graphical tools since publication has meant that there are options for data exploration which were unachievable at the time of writing. Nevertheless, it makes for an excellent primer for how to think about exploring data and why various graphical approaches make sense before get caught up in the details of how to finesse your chart of choice. It is one of the classics in the field of data visualization.
__label__2 excelent more than a year and still working: great cality product, may be this year need to replace the battery, I use this a lot even at the beach, and the poliuretane strap keep like brand new... recomend this product a lot...
__label__1 jams up the reader: Sorry; I meant this for the labels I bought. I'm sure the applicator is dandyunhappy because my reader wouldn't open up after trying to read one with a sticker on it.I gave up and bought a $99 Canon printer that prints labels. Way cool printer
__label__2 All about price and delivery: The product is a great product that I have used for years. Sadly, my local spot where I bought it closed. I made this Amazon purchase based on price.....best I have found. The pleasant surprise was the product arrived,carefully packed, 2 days after I ordered ....5-6 days ahead of the estimate.
__label__1 Average Holiday Movie: I think people are just associating with their 80's era childhood while watching this movie. I think the movie was just average.I just watched this for the 1st time because there was so many comments that this was a holiday classic. I grew up in the 80's and missed it entirely. The movie was just ok for me. A few comical moments, but I don't think I would watch it again.For genuine Christmas Video Movie Classics, I recommend the Alastair Sim version of Scrooge done in the 1950's & A Wonderful Life
__label__1 Warning - Copy Control!: While the two live tracks on this single are excellent, the CD is encoded with Capitol/EMI's Copy Control. That means that the CD can only be played in CD players or on a PC/Mac via its own player (included on the disc); also, some CD players and computers have a lot of trouble reading the CD. You can't copy the tracks to an MP3 player or iPod, you can't copy the songs to a CD, and you can't add the tracks to your Windows Media Player or iTunes music library. It's your call as to whether or not you want to pay $13 for a CD with extremely limited functionality. Personally, I'll only be purchasing non-Copy Control CDs from now on. I don't appreciate being treated like a criminal by the companies that I purchase my music from legitimately.
__label__1 Okay, but not good: I'm not impressed. They are not bad, but have a really cheap, cheesy feel to them. The cases are flimsy plastic and the sound is unremarkable. I guess they work- sound does come out and they are small. If that is what you need, then they are okay.
__label__1 Toshiba garbage: Gave this as a gift. Finally, recipient confessed that unit failed and has been waiting for repair for over 3 months. Unit is at authorized service center since. Toshiba knows that some part is deficient but never made recall. Keep away. It works for a bit and then fails and their after market support is the worst. Why take a chance? As a gift it was an embarrassment. Instead of giving something to enjoy, it resulted in an unimaginable problem for the recipients to take care of. Toshiba could not care less even though they know the specific component is a problem.Go SONY or something else.
__label__1 Not up to par, and small: My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price. I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled, but there were also a couple other issues. First, the bottom was extremely slippery (pun intended). Maybe this would improve with wear (like outside on concrete), but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor. Second, the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe. I could feel it clearly, even with socks on. I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem.
__label__2 Easy Slicing with Zyliss: I bought the slicer for our 90 year old near blind grandma to slice her tomatoes thin and even without cutting herself. My husband tested it out & loves it. We had so much fun we sliced a lot at first. It slices both large tomatoes and plum tomatoes without squishing them and you can adjust it for thick or thin. Orange slices look great and you can eat them without squirting juice all over. I sliced apples & made cinnamon apple bake. It cleans quickly & easily & folds away conveniently - and you don't have to change the blade. We kept the slicer for ourselves and ordered another one for Grandma. She loves it too!
__label__1 It hurt for a week: My husband bought this seat, and here is his review:I put on this seat as a replacement for the stock seat on my bike. I realized at first it had less padding and was right on my sit bones, exactly what I was looking for. However, something about the seat design caused the bottom of my legs to hurt. And they hurt for a week. Somehow this seat gave me a horrible saddle sore. I thought about trying to toughen up, but decided this seat was not worth it. I switched back to my stock saddle without ever trying this one again.
__label__1 STUPID WITH NO PLOT: ANOTHER STUPID MOVIE WITH NO PLOT OR STORY LINE AND ABOUT AS SCARRY AS A BUGS BUNNY CARTOON ...SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS. AND GRUDGE 2 AND 3 ARE EVEN WORSE ... I PURCHASED ALL 3 AND GAVE THEM AWAY AND I STILL FEEL GUILTY FOR STICKING SOMEONE ELSE WITH THEM ...HORRER FLICK NO ... HORRABLE FLICK YES!!!
__label__2 Everything in its Place: This sets covers it all! Every tool in this kit has specific uses, without redundancy from one tool to the next. The quality and engineering of the is the best, typically the "Irwin" trademark. The Groovelock design is rock-solid; the pliers adjust quickly to needed sizes without any slippage. Everything else in this set does exactly what they are designed for without compromise. The kitbag is a well designed roll with elastic stays on each end. This makes nice compact storage when not in use and easy access to the tools when rolled out. The pockets are deep enough that you don't have to worry about the tools falling out.
__label__2 Good suspense: Well crafted storyline. Main character three dimensional secondary characters a little weak but overall a good story. Disappointed with the ending cos it seemed to end before the story as if there will be a sequel and I don't think this has sequel potential.
__label__2 Touching: I actually watched this in class and loved it so much that I bought it so that I could share it with my family.
__label__1 Unsatisfactory: Cook has written a bad ending for some interesting people. It was unsatisfying and banal. I got the feeling that he is sick of this milieu and is killing it off by degrees. It appears that there is to be another book. The question is why ?
__label__1 only works on OLDER iPODS: this does not work with my brand new 80gig ipod. only the sounds comes through. ITS NOT A DEAL WITH KNOWING HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. its about apple wanting more money, you MUST buy an apple product to connect video to you tv. i have bought many different cables just like this one and only the sounds comes through on all of them.
__label__1 Utah's Shiing Story: I recieved the VHS Utah's Skiing Story after I arrived home from Utah on May 10 2007. The plastic on VHS case was damaged when I tried to play it last week so I have not been able to view the tape. I would like to return the tape and get one I can see. Any way you can help or give me a phone number to call.
__label__1 Poor quality: The DVD jacket states "digitally remastered". This is the poorest quality image and sound. It appears worse than the original television version. The image is grainy and the audio does not sync with the image.Very disappointing for a truly wonderful classic version of Cinderella. Do not bother purchasing.
__label__1 Where's the sex,drugs and rock n' roll?: Gene Simmons took pot shots at Emerson ,Lake and Palmer for being too serious in terms of musicianship.Here,we have Kiss trying their turn at serious musicianship with less than stellar record sales.Not so easy is it guys?Kiss is an act ,that happens to play music.No serious musician listens to Kiss to steal licks or technique.They do however love to steal the business model that made these guys famous and rich.Kiss's stab at serious concept music is a bit like Stallone trying to do Shakespeare.Not a good fit.Their niche is party music that glorifies sex,drugs and rock n' roll.It may not play well with their egos ,but it does so with their bank accounts.
__label__2 good value: Bought first one several months ago for dog food. It worked so well that I bought a second on for my alpaca food in the barn. Grest value and the cheapest place to buy was amazon.com. As for the way it is mounted I did beef it up with a piece of 3/4 inch wood dont know if I had to, just being sure it would hold. The plastic seemed like it might not hold up as I keep them full. Dont hesitate to buy. As I need more I will be buying more.
__label__2 This a great clipper!: I've owned this product for over three years and it still trims hair very well. It's easy to operate and handles large amounts of hair at a time. Make sure you clean it before, during, and after usage. Also, lubricate the blade with mineral oil to keep the blade sharp. Heating does occur if you use the product for more than 10 minutes (give or take). Worth every penny!
__label__2 Stunning Book....Best since Cider House Rules: I am a huge John Irving fan and being a little dissapointed with some of his last books I approached this book witha little trepedation. But is this man back to form or what!! It is wonderful to see a man taking his time with a story and letting his characters grow through the story. The scenes with the prostitute in Amsterdam are both touching and disturbing. WONDERFUL BOOK
__label__2 FUNNY funny... Gotta watch it: I'm a tennis nut and watching this just cracks me up. If you don't play tennis, you'll still laugh out loud.
__label__1 Not the same anymore...: This is the second Kensington notebook lock I've owned. I left the first one behind at a hotel. Unfortunately, they don't make things like they used to anymore. The first one had distinct features on the lock and key, making it pretty unique and probably harder to remove by someone without a key. This one had a came with a pretty generic key, like a skeleton key. It's so plain looking, I'm led to believe that every lock has the same exeact key. So chances are if someone got ahold of one of these keys, they can unlock just about every one of these locks from Kensington.
__label__1 Still Waiting: I've read all the great reviews of this book and it was a must buy for a stocking stuffer for Christmas.....It has yet to ship and I refuse to cancel my order!! Crossing my fingers it ships soon.
__label__1 Boring plot.: I have to agree with CaseyNissa from California. I also have to say that the Native American part wasn't very realistic. Not many of them would have even wanted to talk to White men, much less make friends with them. HORRIBLE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 diffrent but good: You know I dont listing to rock music just because of how hard it is.It's about how good the music is.Therefore someone that just like's the style of there first album "The sickness" would probably not like this one.But if your open minded about bands changing there sound or style you probably would like this.I love most of the tracks.When I first listined to to this album my favorite song was liberate.But I recamend listing to it first if your interested in buying this.
__label__1 Seriously flawed phone: Phone stops ringing - absolutely no help from Panasonic's tech support. Anything but this phone!Panasonic KX-TGA670B -Extra Handset for KX6700 Series (2-LINE) - Black
__label__2 Funny: You can't go wrong with Sat. Nite live. They are so funny, these older ones are anyway. They are wild and crazy. If your depressed, turn one of these on and it works. You will find yourself laughing really hard. Great investment for getting rid of the blues
__label__1 Are you kidding me?: What an amazing idea for a book. If only the author had enough intelligence to actually learn what a musical was or perhaps look at at least one score before charging us forty dollars. For example, Audrey II, in "Little Shop of Horrors", is clearly a Bass yet we are told HE is a Soprano. The last song that Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II ever wrote together was "Edelweiss". However Mr. Devenney does not feel it necessary to include it with the other songs in "Sound of Music". Perhaps he needed room for "Cable hears Bali Ha'i" in "South Pacific", which is kind of funny because the song does not exist. We can chalk a few mistakes up to the editors... let's say 1...2...maybe even 3 but just based on a simple cover to cover reading, there were..... drumroll ......................47.
__label__1 Print is MICROSCOPIC: I ordered this to have as a handy, small quick reference. I had NO idea the print would be this microscopic. It can't even be a 6 pt font - probably more like 4 or 5. It is too tiny to even be able to read. Very sad and would not recommend to anyone no matter how good their eyes are.
__label__1 Watch Out!!!!!: I had been taking this for about six month and was experiencing a little discomfort with urinary and bowel discharge. I went to see my doctor for a check up and she said stop taking it at once. I was talking to a friend that had the same experience. Is it helpful or not? Perhaps for some individuals, I have no more discomfort since I stopped taking it so for me that says something right there. I do use other Swanson products that I am totally happy with.
__label__1 Great film - Lousy DVD quality: American Graffiti has always been one of my favorite movies; I have absolutely NO critcism of the film. I would rate the movie itself with 5 stars. But... this review is in regard the extremely poor quality of the DVD. I am purplexed that many say the DVD picture qualtiy is good, because that is my major complaint. The scenes are all extremely dark; you can barely see what is going on even after adjusting the light levels on your televison. I played this DVD on a HDTV 50 inch large screen televison - maybe if I played it on an old tube TV the picture quality would have been better?? Also.. as others noted, the sound quality is not as good as the original film. Very disappointing purchase - I expected better picture and sound quality from a DVD.
__label__2 oh to be 11 again...: frente and w:ax make this album worth a look. still not convinced? who hasn't wondered what a "spider man" cover by the ramones would sound like?
__label__2 from years gone by: This is a cd composed of beautiful piano music with orchestra accompanied music. It was a lp record in the early 60's,and it brings back many happy memories(in particular of a girl named Christine, whom was my girlfiend at the time and we used to go ice skating to the song "Our Winter Love".BIll Pursell had a big hit with this song , and a minor hit with "A Wound Time Can't Erase" which if I'm not mistaking was the flip side of our winter love,anyway, this cd is very relaxing and enjoyable to listen too, and will most likely be very pleasant too listen to.Very nice,Very nice.
__label__2 Fantastic read!: I don't read a whole lot, but this one was suggested along with the first so I read them both. I could hardly put them down. I like the characters better in this book than in the first. I can't say enough good about this one. It's just fantastic!
__label__2 Christmas gift: An item ordered to complete a Dewalt set for my husband for Christmas. Dewalt are high quality tools. Very satisfied.
__label__1 Product not as picture and paid too much: What I received was some 'other' form of the product - I've not attempted to use it yet, but it may not also be a 22-16 AWG Solder Seal - we'll see. Also, for not being the product pictured (which I've used in the past w/great success), the product took too long to arrive and was over priced...
__label__2 Dewalt #2 Phillips 5 Bit Set: I have truly become a loyal dewalt customer. Their products have never failed me and just like this phillips #2 five pack, they do the job VERY well. They are very well made and made to last. They have not stripped like other cheap bits I have bought in the past and I'm very satisfied. This will last me a LONG time. Great product.
__label__2 Muchas gracias: Muchas gracias por este compac. Yo me encanta Sui Generis y se tocar muchas de sus canciones con mi guitarra. La primera vez que los esuche era cuando estuve en Ecuador en 92. Desde alli solo tenia un solo cassett. Ya por fin tengo en compact. GRACIAS!
__label__1 Not What I Would Wear: The photo makes the face look like it has a lot of red but I couldn't see any red tone at all when I actually received it. The stones running outside the bezel are set in gold which really looked cheap to me. The mesh band was the one positive point of the watch, but it's definitely not a watch I want to be seen wearing. Returned.
__label__2 Great great great: Love it love it love it. It screams for mids and highs, the bass sounds exceptional for being a bridge pickup, you wont be dissapoibted. I put it into an old mexican strat, and I'm more than satisfied.
__label__2 Farberware: This is replacing a farberware percolater that I had for years. Never had any troubles with the old one, can't last forever.
__label__1 Worst book in the world: I am a third year Computer Science major at the University of Waterloo. My class had the misfortune of using this book for two linear algebra courses. This is the worst book in the world. The entire book is one long incomprehensible run-on sentence. The definitions make no sense and the notation is alien. This book deserves negative stars.
__label__1 At least Paris Hilton dies!: Its not that bad - and Paris Hilton does die well in it - we all cheered when she did! The movie is worth a look but i would rent it first and see if you like it. It is better than people have been letting on!
__label__1 Give me a Break: Just another conservative bashing book trying to prove how riches can save everyone despite the fact that all of our american greed is destroying everything in our path. This guy must of got the idea for this book after having lunch with Ann Coulter after they got finished reminiscing about their rich childhoods and how they had to spend it with all of these poor liberals around. Get rich quick or get fooled again.
__label__1 Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengance: As a fan of this comic, I was dissapointed with this movie. Seems like Nick Cage is trying to hang on too hard. Could have done without the narrative..movie was a bit campy despite the good cast. Better luck next time?
__label__2 Ya gotta love dogs.: I have read the entire series. And, I'm pre-ordered on book #4. The books all seem to be so tongue in cheek...all of them are just good clean fun reading. Nothing serious...but, not fluff either. I stumbled on this series by accident and have been a faithful reader ever since.I recommend this author. Everything so far has been a blast. I hope she keeps it up. Ya gotta love the dog...I've got two that are almost like him..minus the magic.
__label__1 Total Waste: We purchased 2 of these from our local home improvement store. Loved the LED night light, did not flicker but softly glowed as the room got darker and then got brighter as the night went on. However, like the other reviews, within 6 months both stopped charging and did not work as a flashlight or power failure light. We did not keep the packaging or receipt so we cannot return them. I may continue to use 1 just as a night light, but we are looking for another alternative. We cannot find anywhere on line to contact Sylvania about this product and complain. We just ordered 2 new lights (totally different brand and model) from an external website and we're hoping they will work better.
__label__1 Defective ...: I received this unit with great expectation and was disappointed. The directions were incomplete. A picture indicated using a regular screwdriver to assemble the parts. The screws functioned as set screws. After some difficulty I realized it was necessary to use a no. 0 phillips screw driver. After attempting assembly with the proper tools and an assistant holding the parts I was unable to move the set screw. ...
__label__1 Ehhh!!: Um This movie was not all that good, it has great special affects because the protagonist and antagonist are not martial artist. The movie was kind of entertaining because of all the blood and special affects but if you are looking for real martial arts..this is not it!!!
__label__2 only the best for breakfast: ya gotta try one or two or three. my mother never told me about Bays. Hmmm, what else do you suppose she never told me? THE BEST.
__label__2 Bulletproof: IT's made by TRIPP LITE, that ought to tell you how good it is. Love the two that I bought. Only wish they made one with individual outlet switches!
__label__2 GREAT HOMESCHOOL TOOL!!: homeschooling my 6 year old (3rd grader) and she is easily bored, but this has really held her attention. ok, i'll admit it, i play it too! She LOVES it, uses the games, and the clock/alarm feature. GOTTA ORDER that spelling one next!!! I can't say enough about this wonderful tool.
__label__2 This is the one to get: This is the Sinatra Christmas album to get, recorded right in the midst of his Capitol years (his greatest music). Christmas Waltz, particularly the version that is the fifth song on this collection, is one of the very best things Sinatra ever recorded. The subtle, complex melody, wonderful lyrics and arrangement, and of course the singing make it a timeless classic.
__label__2 Fast Food Nation review: Fast Food Nation was a wonderful honest view at the effects of fast food. It was refreshing to see writing with such candor in it. Although at times the reading was a bit dull, Schlosser spiced it up with a few jokes and such hidden and bizarre information. It was a wonderful and awe-inspiring read.
__label__2 Poetry in Motion: Quite simply, an amazing disc. Musical groups need to evolve, and that's what Indigo Girls have done in this album, and in every album since the start of their career. They consistently build upon their previous style and create something new and interesting. Which is as it should be. As my wife put it, it's the difference between being a true musician and just being a performer. And, as for the reviewer who lamented not finding "the poetry that left me contemplating the message longer than these lyrics will," apparently s/he hasn't listened to the hidden track, "Philosophy of Loss." Not only will you be captivated by the beauty of the melody, you'll be thinking about the lyrics for a long, long time.
__label__2 Just plain great music!: I own two releases by Ulrich Schnauss, and I am very impressed with his ability to reach deep into the listener's mind and touch it. "Far Away..." is a great soundtrack for life. This album contains six powerful tracks that may sound a little similar too eachother at times, but never become boring. Ulrich Schnauss isn't doing anything different in this genre, but he's doing it better than most electronic artists. Some of the tracks make me think of other songs that I've heard in the past by another artist, but I can never put a finger on it. This album is so good that I can't pick a favorite. I like all the tracks the same, which is a rarity for me. This is a great CD for any fan of electronic or alternative music.
__label__2 Wonderful story, good production, awesome cast.: It's great to see that some people realize that [an alternative social] life isn't bound by borders of big cities like New York City or LosAngeles.Mississippian Tag Purvis comes home (back to Meridian, Mississippi to be exact)to film this wonderful film.I won't go into the details as they are already detailed above - except I will say that Karen Black (Aunt Summer) rocks in this film and Dan Montgomery (Griffith) not only is a [good looking] but he can actually act.I just want to thank Tag and other [alternative social life style]Mississippians (be sure to read Mississippian Dr. John Howard's book 'Men Like That: A Southern Queer History'- availabe here on Amazon.com) for putting the spotlight on ... Mississippi and the ... South.
__label__2 shelves: I use these shelves in my shed kitchen to hold all my can goods. I purchased 4 for stacking. they are very strong
__label__1 Amusing at times but could have contributed more insights: For well over thirty years, I have been visiting France for a minimum of one month per year, and feel very fortunate to have many French friends.While I found the beginning of the book most amusing, I did not appreciate the "puff" pieces. I wish, after his having spent twenty years in France, M. Robitaille would have given us his insights as to why the French still do not buy automobiles with automatic transmission, or why General De Gaulle was never promoted to Marshall of France, or the contribution McDo (McDonald's) has made to France, or why Disneyland Paris is now a success, or consider that M. Mitterand did actually have a lovely apartment where he lived with two others, or why Jean Moulin continues to be honored, etc., etc.
__label__2 I could not put it down - Great story: Because of the topic, I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did. Boy, was I surprised! I literally could not put this book down because I kept wanting to know what was going to happen next.I think this book was very well written and it is a great story. There were parts that made me laugh and there were parts that made me cry.This book has made me more sensitive to other cultures and more interested to know what goes on around the world (and world history).I recommend this book to everyone, no matter where you come from.
__label__2 Great value: This bag is roomy enough for all my stuff needed for a single workout, even when the shoes are in it. For the price, its a great bag. Its not of TUMI quality materials, zippers and construction, but a comparable TUMI bag is $200. (I own TUMI but only for my business travel needs which must withstand very hard daily use and airline baggage handlers).You will like this bag for the gym. I considered giving it 5 stars but for value priced items I only go as high as 4.
__label__2 Minus at least one star for having Michael Rapaport: Hey Mike- stick to your day job. Using mother***** every other word doesn't make you a good rapper. Otherwise, not bad.
__label__1 Power cord missing: How do you plug in something that is meant to be plugged in if they don't send a power cord? Really, I paid this much for a docking station and they can't even send a power cord?
__label__1 DON'T BUY FOR KINDLE: Good lord this book is full of typos. I'm not knocking the quality of the story since it was impossible to read through all the mistakes. I'm talking typos in every single paragraph. DON'T BUY THIS KINDLE VERSION!!!
__label__1 never received it in the mail: I ordered this magazine 4 months ago, still have not received a copy.just about to contact my credit card company to reverse charges.I have sent 3 emails to amazon to resolve - nothing has happened yet.
__label__1 big disappointment!: 1.As a Mimi fan, this DVD show bad perfomences of her (with Olivia NJ very bad video) its obvious she has much better perfomences aruond the world.2.the vidios are cut in the muddle3.some vidios are changed in the middle to another performences - how can i enjoy half a show?? its wired and dissaponting to see that.4.I saw much better performences on internet sites and I am sad to waist 13$ on a bad DVD like this one.5.I also orderd Medison Squere Garden DVD and he was amazing! so I have a way to compere between a good DVD and a bad one.
__label__2 Thought provoking: In Phoenix Tales, Gregory Bernard Banks has created alternate worlds of time and space, with life and death as a common denominator. Speculative fiction better describes the genre of this book than does science fiction simply because the stories are steeped in very human reality.Banks is a masterful story teller with a vivid imagination. I enjoyed all the stories in this book and was unable to decide on a favorite. Aside from the pure entertainment value, Mr. Bank's stories explore social and cultural issues with a fresh and sometimes unusual point of view.Phoenix Tales-Stories of Death & Life is a good read; highly recommended.
__label__1 Three Junes: I read about 2/3s of this book and gave up. It's extremely boring and pointless. Nothing happens in this entire book. No murders. No action. No nothin'!It's called Three Junes not because it's about three people named June, but because the book is split up into 3 parts that all take place in June of different years.The first part is about Paul McLeod. The entire story is about him on a cruise. That's it. Nothing happens on the cruise.The second part is about Paul's son Fenno. This was probably the best of the 3 stories. Fenno is gay and owns a book store in Manhattan. His neighbor, Mal, asks him to take his bird Felicity for him. He wants her to have a home after he is gone. You see Mal is dying of AIDS.Fenno also meets Tony. A gay photographer who's house sitting in Manhattan. They have wild sex every day for a while and then Tony disappears.And I didn't finish the 3rd part. I tried, but I just couldn't make it.Please, don't read this book. It's a total waste of your time.
__label__2 Wonderful necklace: I gave this necklace to my 91 year old mother for her birthday. She was thrilled with it. She especially likes the easy clasp (which is one of the reasons I chose the necklace). My mother lives in another city and I have not had a chance to see the necklace on her yet, but she is really happy with it and has gotten lots of compliments.
__label__2 My "secret ingredient": I throw a bit of this into almost everything sweet that I bake. People rave about my baking, and I think this is why. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Ellénika mou...: Riding on the waves of inspiration and dreams of Kefalloniá, I purchased the book and tape set. Like other reviewers, I found that the conversations are recorded by native speakers who run their words together; this is helpful, as it gives a true-to-life pronunciation of the speakers a foreigner would encounter. I also found it helpful that the language is printed in arabic and the Greek alphabet is introduced slowly. I strongly recommend for those in pursuit of a grammatical exactitude, a supplementary grammatical text. On the whole, this text and its tapes are truly excellent...and a bargain!
__label__2 Good advice for that first year: I highly recommend this book to anyone sending their kid off to college. It's very helpful to understand the ups and downs that will come, so that when you get those calls you can know what's normal and what's not, when to get involved and when to promote independence(or just lend an ear). The book is well organized and easy to read. I found myself going to specific areas for some great advice and then reading it almost cover to cover.
__label__2 Great Bag: This Targus bag is exactly what I needed. The fact that it is a brief, messenger, or backpack is the bag's biggest advantage. There are more pockets than I know what to do with. The only con to the bag is that the main compartment doesn't have a zipper closure, and is thus only covered by the main flap. If you're walking through an airport or outside in bad weather, it may be wise to have a cover on your notebook computer and make sure the flap is securely closed.
__label__2 Cubic Zirconia Ring: Beautiful ring. One of the best rings I ever bought for the price..Definite buy..
__label__1 Complete fluff -- fire the Donald: Donald Trump has written some interesting and useful books (The Art of the Deal, Surviving at the Top) but his Think Like a Billionaire is complete fluff. Purporting to be "everything you need to know about success, real estate and life," his advice is short and simplistic. He does a list of the best of various things and cites McDonalds as the best hamburger in the world.Many of the photos have the first name of people who are not mentioned in the text. The end of the book has photos of his employees with no names at all. His fiancee Melania is in just about every picture with a strange glare on her face--very unbecoming. Is she trying to imitate the Trump grimace? Trump prides himself on being the epitome of quality. He has failed miserably here.
__label__2 Great piece of nostalgia!: This was the first horror movie that my parents allowed me to see when I was younger. A friend of mine came for a sleepover and my mother took us to the video store and we were browsing the horror section and my mom finally picked this movie for us because it did not have an R rating. We watched it with my younger brother on our pull out couch and to a couple of 8 year olds, it was terrifying! I can understand why so many adults will not appreciate this movie for its scare factor, but I purchased it based on my childhood memories and hope to create some of those memories with my own daughter. Not to make a tired cliche, but they really don't make movies like they used to, especially horror movies. I will enjoy watching this movie with my kids or letting them watch it with their friends at sleepovers over and over again!
__label__1 Mealy: They're edible, but they've got that 1970's health food store kind of mealy stale taste. There are plenty of competing products which are tastier and still made of 100% natural organic ingredients with no added sugar. The manufacturer seems to have spent millions of bucks on an expensive and annoying marketing campaign which glosses over the fact that there are better, tastier options out there. Try the fruit leather from Trader Joe's, or the really good Clif Kids fruit ropes instead.
__label__2 My Favorite Gentleman Pirate: This is my favorite of the Malory Series. Johanna Lindsey creates romance between the handsome Englishman James Malory and the beautiful American Georgina Anderson. Not only is James Malory a "gentleman pirate" but he is also a "connoiseur of women." Georgina has no intention of falling for the reprehensible rake, but she can't resist his bold, sultry advances. The plot takes the reader to England, the Caribbean and the New England shores. It is full of interesting characters, witty banter and steamy scenes.
__label__1 not a good fit for slim models: none of the buttons fit right and case is very loose. and metal holder to make it upright don't hold and always falls over. great idea, bad craftmanship...
__label__2 Make every day Valentines Day & tell someone you love them: I ordered this playset for my daughter for Valentine's day from Amazon / Toys R Us and it just came today! This Little People Sweet Valentine's Day playset comes in a very nice collectors box just like you'd get it you ordered it directly from Fisher Price Catalog.The playset also comes with some paper valentines to share with all of the Little People characters we all know and love. I love knowing my daughter & I will have hours of imaginary play together!
__label__2 Bangin': I've been following these cats for the last 3 months. FINALLY their album was released and immediately picked it up...WOW, the disc is more bangin' than I had hoped. The beats are super tight and really original...a very, VERY dope sound. The lyrics are amazing too. When Sammy Brazil spits his rhymes you gotta keep rewinding and rewinding!!!! Definitely pick this ablum up, I promise you won't let down. MaddWest if for real!!!!!
__label__2 Connoisseur of SongBirds: Outstanding vocals (her voice and presentation is uniquely great) and a quality orchestra. There is only one USA "songbird" of her genre, (rather was) Patsy Cline. The choice of material is quite good, but not as magnificent, as that of the other CD by Lolita, "Weisser Holunder"; one, that should get Eight Stars on the 1-5 Star scale. Recommend buying that one too.
__label__2 One Of My Favorites: Grosse Pointe Blank lived up to my expectations. It's very funny and witty, and it avoids running into cliches and slow points. John Cusak is great as a hit-man, Martin, going through sort of a "mid-life crisis" although he hasn't even hit his thirties yet. He ends up going back home to do his final job when he meets up with the girl (Minnie Driver) he stood up on prom night and ends up going to his ten-year high school reunion. During his visit, Martin is threatened by rivals and must watch his back to make it out of Grosse Pointe alive. Plot twists and turns come about and it's hard to predict what happens next. Dan Aykyrod delivers a nice performance as Martin's rival. If you enjoy sharp wit and somewhat dark humor, see this movie. Oh yeah, the soundtrack (The Clash, Violent Femmes, The English Beat, The Cure, David Bowie & Queen, etc.) is nice too.
__label__1 Crois Refills -: I have used only one of the Cross refills and it was dry, scratchy and did not write easily. Unsatisfactory.
__label__2 Best price out there: I bought this router for my husband for Christmas. He makes wood signs and needed a light weight router for carving. He put the Makita 3606 router on his wish list but thought it might be expensive since you can only get them from the manufacturer or independent wood shops. I found it on Amazon for an amazing price and he was so excited on Christmas morning. He has already made a few signs for our friends with it and he LOVES it!! This was a GREAT BUY!!!!
__label__2 great replacement for Exceed RC 2.4Ghz 6Ch TX antenna: I bought this antenna to give a shoot to fix the broken TX antenna for Exceed RC 2.4GHZ TX radio, realizing that this antenna might not be compatible with my TX radio. After semi-micro surgical and tricky soldering/gluing, it turned out the replaced antenna works great: good range for signal. I highly recommend this antenna as a good replacement to fix 2.4Ghz TX radio antenna yourself.
__label__2 Profoundly moving and powerful: This book resonates with the power and beauty of spirit. The story is so strong and heartfelt about the entire unfolding of Jesus and the interactions among the others. I was so moved that often I had to stop reading and reflect before I could continue. The story makes sense and rings true to me. A must read. Powerfully told and beautifully written.
__label__2 I HATE YOUR FACE: I've watched this movie so many times I'm surprised my DVD hasn't broke yet. From start to finish, this film will have you laughing. It's an easy plot to follow and whether you like videogames or not, it will keep your interest until the final scene. It seems like the actors really had fun making this film. I say this because the chemistry between characters is noticeable throughout. My friends and I always quote scenes from this movie and I really think it is destined to be a classic. Highly recommended.
__label__1 Overrated: I must start out that I have only been alive for some 20 years and have not have been privy to the evolution of movies. As an example, I wasn't all that impressed with Citizen Kane when compared to modern day movies. However, I can see how it was a pivotal piece of work that laid the foundation for other movies. This is exactly the same way that I feel about Ben-Hur. While the cinematography and acting are spectacular, the over drama becomes heavy handed when it doesn't advance the story. The whole romantic interest was thrown in to draw more people into the theaters. I feel that more time should have been focused on the actual plot. The movie ponders along and eventually comes back to the story in a lazy manner. If this movie were brought out today, then it would be seen as a valiant effort, but overproduced and bland. Overall, not bad, but not too good.
__label__1 The end ruins the integrity: This book really is a peice of [junk] in many respects. Although it is very detailed and reaserched it is obvious that he didnt recheck some of the facts that he got from Courtney. And then the END when he made up the last day of his life down to every detail as if he knew exactly what happened when no one really knows. This book REALLY gives you the wrong ideas as the guy before me said so DONT read it unless you know all of the true facts about Kurt and just want some entertainment
__label__2 Well cared for and interesting: Seller did a great job caring for this book. It came in wonderful shape and I would definitely buy again from this seller. Fast shipping and in excellent shipping condition. Well worth the time and money to get such a great book.Story has a great subject line. Well written - like all of Sandra Brown books. Leaves you wondering what the story will really be. Surprise ending.
__label__2 funny: i thought that this movie was funny.It first started out when these two guys got fired then a robber comes into a resturant where they were and the guy played by robbin williams is shot by the robber and the robber escapes.the movie keep on getting better
__label__1 wrong product description: I was looking for regular size glue sticks to use for my craft projects and found what I thought were the regular size, but was sent mini glue sticks instead. I don't have a mini glue gun, so these didn't work. I live in Turkey and can't find glue sticks at a craft store like in the states, because they don't have them here, so I have to rely on shopping online and trust what I am buying is the correct product, because I can't just drive to the store to look at it. Was very disappointed and was not able to complete my projects, because I didn't have my glue to use.
__label__1 Waste of time: What a bad book. The characters had no depth and the story was repetitive. I had difficulty getting through it and only finished it for my book group. By the way, no one in the group liked it either.
__label__2 Great decoration flag.: Irish pride. I collect a few flags here and there. This flag is a thin nylon material that is awesome for decoration in rooms, etc. I think it'll do well with outdoor use but it'll probably fade and fray over time.
__label__1 Not a programmed text: The title sounded very promising. Following this "programmed text" was very frustrating. Texts like this give programmed instruction a bad reputation. I would not recommend this book.
__label__1 Dense and slow going: I read this book for the book club discussion group. It is dense and slow reading. I felt like I had 1000 pages read by the end. The end is so wierd, but then all of Morrison's novels are out of the ordinary, odd, and dark. I did get a smile from the author's insight into what happens to a black woman's ( or anyone's, I'm sure ) zest for working class jobs once she earns a Liberal Arts degree. ha ha
__label__1 the best pill for insomnia!: If you are having trouble sleeping, get a copy of this book! It is loaded with the most potent sedatives. No, really. I bought it as part of the Visual Studio set, and after several attempts at reading it, I still could not point to one new thing that I gained from it. It's difficult to follow what the author was trying to say, as he seemed to keep jumping from one insufficiently discussed topic to another. I only hope Microsoft would publish better books like SQL Server Database Implementation kit. I have recently bought a copy of Visual Interdev 6 Unleashed, hoping to gain some insight into the wealth of VID 6.0 tool.
__label__2 Even Better Than Hybrid Theory: Yes, it is no lie. Meteora is even better than Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was simply incredible. I'm so happy that Linkin Park didn't sell out and make all of their songs sound like "In the End" since they had such a success with that song. Instead, Meteora is much heavier than their first effort, Hybrid Theory. The music is better, the lyrics are more mature, and the vocals by both Chester Benington and Mike Shinoda have improved greatly. I definently recommend this album. It's what every rock fan has been waiting for.
__label__1 XP-VERY DISAPPOINTING.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: Finally a good upgrade easy download,Well I'm telling everyone don't believe everything that's said about Windows-XP. I have Windows 98. I thought that I could upgrade to xp. I tried 2 times to upgrade only to be stopped right in the middle of the installing process. My computer is barely 2 years old, and I've never had trouble downloading a program, as I had trying to download this one. I know that sometimes programs freeze but I was hoping that it this one wouldn't. I wish that I could rate this a minus one. The only way this will work is if you buy a computer that has Windows XP preinstalled.
__label__2 Panasonic KX-TG5432M 5.8 GHz Platinum Cordless Phone: Happy with the purchase. Delivers everything I was expecting from it.
__label__2 WOW!: I used the glue to repair a kitchen chair that I purchased from an antique store. I'm thrilled to say it's still holding strong! I will caution though to make sure you read the directions and follow them exactly.
__label__1 Where do I begin...: I have a decent collection of DVD's, that are all over the board.. From Jillian to Turbo Jam to Tae Bo. I can honestly say this is the worst workout I've ever done. Luckily, I got it on Netflix instead of actually buying it. I agree with most reviewers in that Anna is hands down the worst. She has no charism and is fake. However, I don't really fault her for that because she has no experience and probably didn't know what she was getting into. Her "workout" was so easy. Bob's segment, was classic Bob. It was good and challenging. However, it was only 15 minutes. The last workout was terrible. The instuctor was good and seemed like he knew what he was doing but the routine sucked. It was so repetative and boring. Overall, I felt like I didn't get much of a workout. I don't think Biggest Loser is doing the franchise any favors by putting crap like this out.
__label__2 Another Remarkable Novel From Margaret Atwood: I'm sure there's not much I can add that other reviewers haven't already discussed. So I'll keep this short. `The Blind Assassin' is yet another remarkable novel from Margaret Atwood. It's complex plotting and depiction of the main characters through various stages of their lives is an enviable accomplishment. The story-within-a-story device is managed incredibly well by Atwood. If you are a fan of her other works (`Alias Grace' is sill my favourite and her best) don't hesitate to purchase this novel. If you're not a fan, purchase it anyway. You're guaranteed a good read and might just find yourself converted to being an Atwood fan.
__label__1 Not a Must Read for Sure...: I picked up the book with a hope of picking some cool fundas in Consulting and was very disappointed. I would put the book as a small collection of "Common Sense" and none of the methods to be really extra ordinary. But as people say "Common Sense is not so common", one can just quickly go through by borrowing the book. One thing I liked in the book is the importance of facts in Consulting. Couple of points mentioned at the begining justifying the need to focus was facts was interesting
__label__2 Excellent Text, Short and to the Point: If you are a law student (who else would buy this) and you have to use this text, well you are in luck. This book, accomanied by a copy of the federal rules will be all that you need in the study of evidence. This text isnt like most books on evidence, there are no problems, only cases and notes. The cases correspond to specific rules in the Federal Rules and help explian how each rule works. Also the notes expand on the rule to show how it would it apply in other contexts.Also if you are in a TX law school, this book will also help to illustrate some of the key difference in the federal rules and the Texas state rules (i.e. statement against interest hearsay exception).All in All this is a great text.
__label__2 The writing is fantastic: An erudite, humane read about 'whiteboy' Dylan in Brooklyn during the 70's. The writing is gripping but at times scattered. The friendship between Mingus and Dylan is the focal point of the novel yet at times, seems less like a real friendship than a novelist's creation of one. Additionally, the grown-up Dylan is not especially compelling. The tragedy of the book is that Mingus' life is short-changed, especially as his story is the most interesting. Yet, with all my complaints, I really enjoyed this novel and the descriptions of a Brooklyn world I will never know.
__label__2 Flawed characters-that's the point!: Not every novel offers a spoon-fed protagonist. The reviewers giving low ratings seem to have misunderstood the cast of main characters altogether. Do you people only read books about princesses and knights in shining armor that you can "sympathize with"? Haven't you ever come into contact with that person in life that plays the perpetual victim, making mistake after mistake and never bothering to get their life in order? At the end of the novel both Kathy and Lester come to see prison as their rightful abode, while Behrani can only find solace in what he assumes will be a blissful afterlife.This isn't one of those "choose-your-own-adventure" books where you get upset when your character makes a misstep. It's a study of dysfunctional characters.
__label__1 Soooooo disappointed: I can not believe that the Harts did this to Michael and Jessie. They said the only reason that they even made a sequel to Sooner or Later was because the fans "demanded" it. I don't think, no I know this is not what they/we wanted. I have ordered the third book "Now or Never" and I am hoping it will be better but I'm worried it's not. I haven't heard many good things about it either. And to be honest, I'm almost afraid to read it. What have the Harts done to them now? They say there is room for a 4th book, if so, Bruce and Carole, please write it and make Michael and Jessie live happily ever after. There is a site called "He's all that" and they have written their own conclusions to the "Michael and Jessie" saga. Maybe Bruce and Carole should take a look at those. "They" show how it really should end. Happily!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Astonishing change in style: But not only in style. Also moods, contents and situations are different and show a lower level than in the previous eight books. The other books were deep in concepts, that one is good to read for killing time
__label__1 Worse than weak coffee: What's worse than weak coffee? A weak plot and a weak main female character. I can't stand this main character who allows her philandering ex-husband to stay in her apartment. This woman is a 'victim' of her ex-mother-in-law's attempts to get the couple back together. While apparently upset that she 'has' to let her ex-husband stay with her, she is flirting with a married detective. Ugh. Add a pretentious attitude toward coffee-making and you have a thoroughly distasteful character.So is that the worst of it? No. The story is interrupted several times by instructions on making the so-called perfect cup of coffee. Is this supposed to be a coffee cookbook or a mystery? Including the recipes at the back of the book is one thing, but in the middle of the story?This story seems so poorly written I can't see how it ever made it to the publisher. Maybe it was self-published--that would explain a lot.Just like with bad $5 coffee, it doesn't live up to the hype. No more for me, thanks.
__label__2 Roland and the wolves: Its nice to finally have the 5th book after such a long wait. The book is packed with excitement, although the actual fight between the ka-tet and the wolves coulda been a little longer in comparison to all the time leading up to it. It is also filled with surprises, including an old character from another story. It's also good that King is going to give us what we deserve as faithful readers (since i was in high school)and give the Dark Tower Series an ending. I only hope the ending is a fitting one for such a complicated and long series.
__label__2 Outstanding.: His mother reports that this is the first toy that he cries for if he drops it. He is four months old and this thing engages him completely.
__label__2 repurchable: i'd like to buy it again.My 6, 4 years sons can draw, scribble so easily with these markers.I'm not sure they really enjoy their fun scent though.If there's bad one, you have to tell cap's top and bottom when close the markers.
__label__1 What's the point?: I became a huge queen fan back in 1976 and i am still a huge fan of their music yet even a real fan like myself can not endorce this set of songs. Greatest hits? What hits? There really arn't any. 4 songs from the "made in heaven" album, some remixes, some songs from freddie and brian solo albums that nobody really cared about in the first place and some songs performed with quest vocalists. Big deal.No real value here at all. ...
__label__1 It was watery and did not smell like Hugo Boss: I bought this because of the low price,but it was watery and didn't smell like Hugo Boss; I think it was old. I should have returned it, but waited too long and it ended up in trash.
__label__1 Very Dissapointing: I purchased this for my 5 year old in the hopes that she might enjoy the songs and become familiar with some of the sounds of the French language. This is the first movie that she has refused to watch! (and she has watched a number of movies in French) It is very poorly made. The songs are terrible and the children singing them are tone deaf.The MUZZY tapes have worked much better.
__label__2 Great Item: The edge hog is a very handy lawn tool. I had one in the past and this reconditioned one works just a well as the new one did. It edges and trenches with ease. It was very easy to assemble and operating it, is a breeze. I would recommened this item to everyone who like a well maintained and tidy looking lawn.
__label__2 Big: Once you realize everything this knife has, it's great. But there's so much on it....it just may take you awhile to use it! Great value for the money!
__label__2 "The World Was Silent. . .": I couldn't put this book down. The story about when "the world was silent" during the Biafran Civil War is gracefully recounted from the perspectives of several different people realistically portrayed by this tremendous new author. I loved the story of the sisters and will look forward to reading more of Adichie's novels.
__label__1 Mediocre pseudo prog.: Porcupine Tree's preceding effort, Stupid Dream, had it's flaws but was far superior to this aimless effort. Wilson has his talents but needs to pay some serious attention to improving his guitar work. He would also be well advised to wait until he has something to say before stepping into the studio. This is really an uninspired mess. Even the band's understated but creative sense of rhythm on Stupid Dream is absent here. You'd be much better off turning to the Flower Kings...Simon
__label__2 if you love U.S., history and geography you'll this book: This book offers a new perspective on a key phase of U.S. history, and in a very readable way. Strongly raccomended.
__label__2 Excellent BBC series: The DVDs arrived very soon after the release date and $1 cheaper! (I pre-ordered before the release date, and since it was released at a lower price, I received a $1 refund from Amazon!) Excellent series: a very scary and thought-provoking premise. I watched it originally on BBC America, so it was great to see without commercials and uncensored (i.e. Jack's nude scene in Day 2). The last episode was devastating, and my husband and I are still discussing it over a month later.
__label__1 Tedious: The book is very detailed and tedious. Not for someone is isn't serious and just exploring the possibility. This is precise and detailed and intended for someone who has decided to go there.
__label__2 Nice Steam: I have been using this unit since I bought this one (like 3 months back)I waited this long to right this review, so I'll know any drawbacks.Pros1. Packaging and Shipping - Well packaged and came right on time2. Usage - easy to use and easy to maintain (cleaning etc)3. Steam - Steams in 1 min and you get lot of steam.4. You can put any oils/perfumes in the front compartmentConsWater Compartments are little smaller in sizeI want to give 4.5 stars only for that reason, other than that is a 5 star for me
__label__2 Chocolate Cookies: Ladies if you have read "I Thought About You Today" you will love "Chocolate Cookies". If you have not read it get with it, there is nothing to do but enjoy. It is not only a book of poetry but of short sensuous stories that I as a woman would love to be a part of. For those of you that can take a little more and want to push the envelope just a little more then get the CD by Vincent Tyler "Two In The Mornin" lay back and let him rock you world.
__label__2 A Lagging Indicator of the American Zeitgeist: Burke Devore is the Willy Loman of the new economy -- with a few critical distinctions that reveal as much about our times as they do about the two protagonists. Where Willy aspires to be "well-liked," Burke just wants a damn job. Where Willy dresses up his son's accomplishments, Burke destroys evidence of his son's larceny. And where Willy's sense of failure leads him to kill himself, Burke's leads him to murder others.This book is chilly in its moral ambiguity. But -- offering further proof of our accelerating cultural cycle times -- the novel seems slightly, just slightly, out of date now that the economy has strengthened. An otherwise excellent piece of writing, The Ax misses the Zeitgeist bullseye by about fourteen months.
__label__2 For Fans of Solo Jazz Guitar: If you are a fan of solo jazz guitar, Mimi Fox is an artist that you should seriously consider. She has loads of talent and I find it a bit surprising that we don't see her name mentioned more in the jazz press. I guess that's always been the bane of solo artists.I'm a big fan of Joe Pass but don't think that she is a Joe Pass clone (I don't even think that is possible) but she approaches these standards with a fresh interpretation that lends respect to the well known arrangements but has her voice up front and it's wonderful.
__label__2 Some new Information: There are some new information in the book like the coffin gate and some information regarding Bush's tenure as Texas Governor. But most of the information are well covered in some of the other Bush book. However, he does an analysis on Clinton and Bush.I liked it but did not love it.
__label__1 Nothing cookie about it...: These bars taste nothing like cookies or cream. They're a strange flavor of cocoa flavored cardboard and chewy stuff. Stick with the peanut better flavor. It's 1,000 times better.
__label__1 beware of mistake: Beware of mistake! I have ordered this product twice , but received an odd replacement. Same title but different lable: inferiour material back from the early 60-ties, a 20 min. stand still hazy picture presentation.I received refund, but still want to have the original I once ordered.
__label__1 Revenge season 2: We like to watch, Revenge, the Amazon direct streaming is TOTALLY INFERIOR AND SUBSTANDARD. The sound is so low that I need to buy an amplifier just to hear it. We have 1320 Kbts way more than most people. Your streaming is very bad. Sometimes we loose picture as your streaming KBTS goes down whem more people log on. YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR SITE. WE HAVE NET FLIX which is totally perfect and work flawlessly. Whoever is incharge of your steaming needs to go back to school and learn the trade YOU RATE A VERY VERY VERY POOR
__label__2 j-me: great vocals! very hard cd to find,but if you find it buy it,or you will miss out on some great music!10-stars
__label__1 What were they thinking?: This spatula is heavy and well made. BUT, it is dangerously small. The handle is very short which brings your hand uncomfortably close to the item you are cooking. You take a risk of getting hurt by splattering grease or other liquid or coming in contact with the edge of a hot pan. Because the handle is so short the handle can get hot if used too long. The head of the spatula is very small and is impractical unless you are cooking sliders! The only practical use I can see for this item is to give it to your child for a sandbox toy. Have no idea why anyone would make a spatula so small. What were they thinking?
__label__1 Wish I had a better printer: I got this as a gift, been using it for about a year. It works best when it turned off. Forget about using it for envelopes, just smears the address. Its does not take up to much space, and that's good. On/off switch does not work will, most of the time it just stays on. Does not know when you have paper in the tray, and don't put to much in, will not load.
__label__1 really sucks: I dont know why people thought that this is such a great movie. I personally think this movie was horrible with the dry humor that was not funny. A complete waste of time and money!!!
__label__2 Great lights: I chose the driving light for the bumper of my 2012 Wrangler. Unlike the 800 Rally lights mounted on my windshield mounts, the butt connectors stayed on and did not pull loose. They light up where my high beams don't, perfect combo.
__label__1 A Great Dissappointment: I purchased this book primarily not only for the metaphysical properties, but the pictures and identification. I consider the scanned pictures worthless for use in identification, they are for the most part, flat (no depth of field), dull (poor color rendition),and appear slightly blurry and lifeless. In looking up minerals I had a working knowledge off, either through lapidary, collecting myself, or dealing directly with miners, or mine owners, I found several inconsistencies which lead me to doubt the information of minerals I am looking up and have no knowledge of. The glossy paper the book is printed on, is another negative, through past experience skin oils and field use will decrease its readability greatly over time. Metaphysically, I can make no comments as it is still a subject beyond my ken, but I am learning.
__label__2 business communications book: excellent and easy read. this textbook provides readers with the necessary and relevant skills of communicating in the business world today. extremely useful if entering a business profession!
__label__2 This **** is good.: There isn't one track on this record I didn't love. Marz's lyrics are great and cover everything form the gangster, the inspiring and the funny. You can dance to this record, relax to it and well you know.I definitely recommend it.
__label__2 Awesome!: I purchased this for my little brother- and of course he loved it. It arrived well, it works well, and I have no complaints. One Piece is fantastic.
__label__2 Just right to start the day: A chuckle, a boost, an uplift, a guide. Each day brings a new angle that makes our family's day a little cheerier and a little closer to God.
__label__2 Ally's birthday gift: Along with the Calico Critters Carry Case and a few rooms of furniture, I purchased the little bunk beds for the twin rabbits. The bunk beds are very well made and can be used as a bunk bed or two twin beds. The detail on the beds is nicely done and they are very cute.My daughter loves how small and detailed the furniture is and enjoys hours of playtime with the bunk beds. Anyone who has Calico Critters would love these.
__label__1 Not Bill Murray's best: Bill Murray may be the funniest man alive, in my opinion, but when I finally got around to watching Scrooged, I was let down. Not nearly as funny as I had hoped. Lot's of tired gags and it doesn't really pay off in the end.
__label__2 Like promised but they are smelly!: Several of the reviews stated that there is a chemical or other odor to these gloves. So I was not surprised when I got them and could smell them before I opened them. However, either the odor goes away or I have gotten used to it. I love the color and the gloves are just what I needed. I got the 14oz and they are a little big. I do have trouble getting the second one tight enough once they are on, as I don't have a free hand to adjust it. That is a minor inconvenience though.
__label__2 Great Book: Amazing talent. Dion Endo seems like he is a new writer since i can't find any of his other works online, but as a debut attempt, it is a an excellent book. It is vaguely reminiscent of American literary classics and a remarkable example of life around the time of World War 2. Plus, i think he is a Hawaii-boy and you can't go wrong with that.
__label__1 God Save us!: Even the title is wrong at least should be "Viva L'Italia!". Is this a best seller of Italians songs? This is not representative of the Italian music. Some good songs yes, but many from southern Italy in a language that also is NOT ITALIAN: is the southern Italian dialect.
__label__2 Cheaper than batteries: I wanted an AC adapter to eliminate using batteries in our keyboard. I found this kit with a couple extras and it was about the same price.
__label__2 Great GF cookbook: This is a fantastic gluten-free (GF) cookbook. The recipies are delicious, and there is a wide variety of items. The dinner rolls taste fantastic, and the pie crust is pretty good for gluten-free! This is my favorite GF cookbook, and I would recommend it as a first cookbook for somebody who is just starting the GF diet, or I recommend it as an additional cookbook to the GF pro.
__label__2 Excellent Documentary: Very informative. I was never aware of the speeds that the electric car could attain and that on a single charge it could go at least 70 miles. It is a very practical unit for city driving but you would need something that would last a bit longer for long trips. The people that owned these cars seemed to have a lot of fun driving them.The premise of the film is that the oil companies put pressure on government officials to doom the original electric car. It seems like nobody in the government cares about global warming, pollution and protecting the environment. It was interesting because when the electric car was introduced they talk about gas prices of sixty cents a gallon!
__label__2 A good game, but way too short!: This game actually scared me a couple times, as I witnessed supernatural phenomena via the various monitoring devices, and I wondered what was going to come find me....This is a great game to play if you've ever wanted to be a paranormal investigator--you get to play with some of the funnest toys since the Ghostbusters movie! The only reason I didn't give it more stars was because it seemed way too short. It's still a great buy, however!
__label__2 Pichu Forever: Finally a cd with the music from the movie 2000 on it. The dance of the bellossom is at it's best with this wonderfuly made cd. The songs have various artists such as Weird Al, or Angela Via; but the most important of all is the 12 year old named Alysha who sand Dreams which is one of the best songs on the cd :) Even though this Cd does not come with any promotional inserts the songs themselves are definatly worth it .......
__label__2 dont spend alot of $$$ on hdmi cables!!!: wow!!! this cable is awesome. it is just as good as the expensive monster, phillips, rca, ect., hdmi cables. I believe i purchased mine for under $5, including shipping. I have a 50" plasma hdtv at home that i play movies on from my portable hard drive, and i use this hdmi cable for this very purpose. it is outstanding video quality and outstanding digital sound! highly recommended!!!
__label__2 Canon EF-S 17-85 lens: This lens let me take three other lens from my camera bag.All around great lens for studio work and outdoor or weddings too.
__label__2 Good description of Leisure in History: Hard at Play; Leisure in America, 1840-1940 edited by Kathryn Grover one of the first books on the subject that targets objects of male leisure, namely rifle sports. Russell S. Gilmore, director of the Harbor Defense Museum in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn and PhD, in American History studies the implications of rifle games from 1840-1900 in "Another Branch of Manly Sport." He makes the astute observation that shooting galleries were part of American saloon culture since the 1830s, but the civil war turned the recreation into a necessary skill for the military.It is interesting how Gilmore traces the origins of some American military practices to leisure, further articulating leisure's importance in shaping not only social and consumer power, but politics as well.
__label__2 iM600 portable audio sytem for iPod: I am impressed with the quality of this product, good bang for the buck. Music is crystal clear, remote control comes in handy. I would have liked a little more control over the bass instead of spending extra for a separate system. Overall, I happy with the product, it has met my need
__label__2 2nd Times a Charm: I ordered this battery on behalf of my father so that he would not have to pay for a new phone as his is somewhat dated, but suits he needs fine. The price even with shipping was worth not having to go through the hassle of a new phone and contract.The replacement battery was shipped in the expected timeframe. Unfortunately it was completely dead and would not charge. My father e-mailed informing of the problem and probably wasted $3 and change shipping the bad battery back. In the end he recieved another battery in the same amount of time and it seems to work fine.I can say it's a hassle to have a defective product sent to you, but the fact that this item was replaced rather painlessly deserves another shot at our business.
__label__2 great swing: i chose this swing because of its size and height its easy to get baby in and out just push bar aside it folds nicely and i can bring it from living room to kitchen with ease even with the baby in it. she loves the toys on the sides and naps in it often. the rocking is just enough to keep her content and happy.i have not had the problem of baby slouching like others i guess im just lucky in that aspect. she has been in it since the day she came home. she is 9 weeks and i have had no problems at all. we are very happy with our swing.
__label__2 A great book: My seven year old son got this book for Christmas and loves it. Not only does he like to find the objets, but he loves "racing" his father to see who can find an object first! I would highly recommend this book for any child who loves puzzles!
__label__1 does not seal properly, sets engine code: I tried this locking gas cap on my 07 Chevy Colorado and it set an engine right away....same code as if the gas cap would have been left off. The treading of the cap looks quite different than the stock cap and it does not appear to get a good connection of the filler neck. I've used Stant locking caps on other vehicles with no problems, but this one is not worth buying for a Chevy truck.
__label__1 Disappointed: My pedometer worked fine for two weeks, and then stopped. The clock works, I've reset it, but for two days it did not reliably register steps. Now it doesn't register at all.Omron will "fix" it for me, but the cost of shipping it to them and the return (they make you pay for it) is the same as the cost of a new unit.Reading the reviews it seems some people love their units, but that this failure isn't unique.
__label__1 Religious propaganda, masquerading as romance: This novel hides several agendas. For one thing, there is utterly no mention anywhere on the cover or interior that it's another installment of a published series. Since this is critical to the story, this omission, deliberate or accidental, is unforgivable.Pushed as a 'romance,' there is little to none in this story in the popular definition of historical romance novels. There is little history, either. Instead, the author uses the second half of the novel to 'prove' the stories of the bible are literal and true, one after another, in quick succession. And the heroine is pivotal to all of them. If the aim was to promote spirituality and pseudo-history, the author should have been a bit less devious about luring unsuspecting readers with this tripe.When the heroine is finally reunited with her husband, we discover they have no chemistry. If they do, it certainly isn't evident in the narrative. Don't bother with this one.
__label__2 good transaction: I can not complain about the transaction. The book came as described by the seller, and delivered in decent time period. I will recommend him/her to any friendThk you
__label__1 Smells, no fan means heat goes up and out: I bought one of these heaters at Joe's and was disappointed to the point that I took it back. I burned through two propane canisters trying to rid the foul, toxic smell - it gave me a huge headache, and that was in my ventilated garage. No way I'm going to run this in a smaller space with my wife and kids. Also, this unit has no fan so there's no way to circulate the heat the element is producing. I could hardly feel the heat a foot in front of the unit because it was all going straight up. Going to try to Coleman Pro Cat next.
__label__2 Great delivery speed: I already knew the movie-big Jared Padalecki fan, and he never disappoints. One of his larger appearances, and he looks GOOD. The twins are silly and predictable.
__label__2 Old MacDonald: Old MacDonald is a classic in my home! Everytime my kids watch it, they sing along to all the songs. This video is full of great songs that can be enjoyed by the whole family!
__label__2 The title says it all...: I agree with other reviewers - great recipes for preserving your excess pods. I don't think the authors ever intended that this would be 'the definitive' guide, more a book of ideas to get you started. For the price I don't think you could find a better book anywhere covering this subject matter!I recommend this book to anyone who is or isn't a chilehead as I'm sure both will enjoy its contents. Dave Dewitt is an excellent author who knows his subject very well.
__label__2 Our kids grew up listening to it, and now they want it: Bought the CD for a B'day present for our 34 y.o. daughter who was listening to our LP of it when she was visiting. She remarked that she was going to have to order it for herself because it is so good. I went ahead and ordered it for her, and she loves it. Our alltime favorite song on the album is the Whale song.
__label__1 Eh...: Gives a very generalized, even boring, view of some dog breeds.I, myself, could have added to the information in here.Its definitely not ALL about dogs.
__label__2 sloppy editing?: After taking great pains to explain difference between adapters and listeners, he mixes them up himself ("listening to Yourself" in chapter 9).
__label__2 Cord Splitter: Great idea I have a 2 and 4 cord splitter. It helps get bulky power cords on the floor. I wish I had a three splitter, instead of the four, as it is a little bulky and I only wanted three....
__label__1 Not Weber - Nope, Couldn't Be: This has to be written by Linda Evans entirely - in my opinion: Not "David Weber & Linda Evans".The writing style has absolutely none of Weber's touch. Rather the writing style here is clearly based on the following philosophy and written word style:Never use one word when 1,000 words can be used; never use one sentence when 100 pages can be written; never have a clear and direct description when a meandering, redundant, over detailed background can be employed; and on and on and on and on and on.Unreadable. Not worth a yawn.
__label__1 McDevitt's flat note: The first McDevitt books I read,Seeker,Omega, andThe Engines of Godreally blew me away. So I was looking forward to "Polaris."It is too bad I had high expectations. This book comes complete with: stereotyped character types, an incomplete grasp of basic human psychology, stilted and uneven story pace, and a smattering of Big Ideas that become trivialized in the ho-hum of the plot.I grit my teeth and read till the end, but I was not rewarded for my efforts with any cookie.It is too bad, because the Big Ideas and awesome backdrops to his stories can make for wonderful reading. But this book is really all too boring.McDevitt has some very strong strengths as a writer, strengths that are emphasized in his earlier books, and some of his later books. Unless you are a devotee of this series, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste the time.
__label__1 Good fit but poor quality: I have worn this brand and style for years but the quality has been compromised. I ordered three pair to replace my worn out jeans. Good fit but lousy quality. I will order another brand to wear to work. When did the quality change? What is the best value now? Very disappointing, but typical with manufacturers trying to save on the cost.
__label__1 Dull and uninspired: There is not much more I can say. The guitar playing is solid as usual. Beyond that there is nothing about Subsurface that is particularly special other than, on the whole, this CD seems less progressive and more fluff. The last track is especially cheesy.
__label__2 8th Grade Homeschool: This is a beautifully written book! I have the second edition which is full of colorful pictures, a benefit at any age. ABeka has quizzes and other geography and civic activities that can be purchased to go along with this text but I am using it simply as a basis for our homeschool year. There is a review page at the end of each chapter which I find particularly helpful. The reading is definitely based on an 8th grade reading level.
__label__1 Great for historical context, but not exactly listenable: Although I give this only 2 stars, I am happy to have this disc in my collection. For me, the music is a taste of the roots of funk. A few consecutive tracks are enough to render the sparse instrumentation and limited recording quality kind of grating. Mix some of these tunes into homemade compilations for great seasoning and counterpoint. It might also be a source for unique samples.
__label__1 Seriously lacking in detail: The author glosses over things without even hinting that there may be details missing. While the book does offer decent explanations on certain topics, it downright ignores important details that will leave anyone new to the material completely lost. The section on wave packets was the nail in the coffin for me. The author jumps from the initial Gaussian form to the solution without even mentioning that a fourier transform had taken place or why extra terms had suddenly appeared. Trying to use this book as an introductory text is brutal and completely ineffective.
__label__1 Cupid in London's Grand Hotel: Cupid comes calling in this anthology with London's luxurious Grand Hotel as the constant setting.Like many anthology series, the stories are hit and miss. But strangely, the only one I enjoyed (and that remained in my memory) was the contribution from the popular Anne Barbour. Her characters were charming and was a very enjoyable read. Other than that I have trouble picking out any one story that stands out in my memory. They all ran together in a blur for me without any notable distinguishing features. I guess I didn't enjoy it very much as a whole, preferring to settle on one story I can sink my teeth into.
__label__2 Excellent DVD with a great set list for true Fates fans..: This DVD was a welcome purchase after the low quality of the previous Fates DVD. The set list is a great one with songs from every album of the Ray Alder era. The sound was nice and clear with everything being able to be heard. There isn't much of a stage set-up, just the guys up there jamming, but I don't care. I have been waiting for a quality live video from Fates Warning for a long time, and Live In Athens does not disappoint. Definite must have for Fates fans, and a great purchase for anyone into excellent music.
__label__2 Sanuk the BEST: This time around I ordered 2 pair (different colors). The first pair was a gift and I wore them everywhere. They have great support and cushion for your heels. Also they fit my narrow feet!
__label__2 It's very good but not cold proof: I bought this expecting better thermal performance.For the price and quality though. I couldn't find anything better.It does help in keeping you warm but not that much.I used it under a sweater and then a jacket and I still felt a little cold in 13 C temperature.Maybe it's just my body thermostat that doesn't work that well. Oh well...I still recommend it. It's 100% cotton and it is on the heavy side. Good price and good quality.
__label__1 Not so Great and a little Terrible: I was really excited for this book, after reading many good reviews it seemed like it would be great. I got it from the library only to find it to be a major let down.I didn't feel connected with the people, and some twists in the book make no sense at all.Also, the fantasy/magic parts were often too dull to read the whole part. I found myself skimming and skipping pages.Although not the worst book I've read, it was hardly worth all the excitment.
__label__2 This Movie Finds You: This is actually difficult to explain, but "Precious" is a surpassingly fantastic movie.It is also a difficult movie. I hated the first 1/2 hour - almost viscerally. This is a loser world; these are losers - LOSERS, and the "mom" - wow! She is the lowest ever. Almost everything about this whole world is breathtakingly bleak and repulsive and unfixable.But this movie really does something fantastic - it takes your mind and carefully brings you into a deeper thicket of humanness. I don't even remember how it happened. But it really did and it is an unexpected and unusual surprise.Oh, and if you know anyone who has any "mom" issues, this movie will touch that base.(one final note - Mariah Carey has a role and she is perfect - blew me away; didn't know it was her until the credits.)
__label__1 A low point: With one exception, this is product, not music. Everything is either a self-parody of things they did better earlier ("Crazy Mama," "Hand of Fate") or an attempt to reinfuse some life by using other genres like jazz or reggae or country. A good strategy but their hearts weren't in it. Memory Motel is the only fresh thing on the album.
__label__1 Christmas Movie: I was so disappointed in this movie. It was very predictable and parts were plain old annoying. I would not recommend this at all. I love Reese Witherspoon, but she should have thought twice before doing this movie. I bought it is blu ray too because I assumed it would be good. I was wrong.
__label__1 weed drill: This item has limited use - could be better with a tapered drill down to the tip (in my opinion).It doesn't have enough value to return.
__label__1 EASY FRENCH STEP-BY-STEP IS NOT SO EASY AT ALL!: Come on, this in no way makes learning French easy. I might as well have bought the paperback version. It is simply a good summary of grammar. No one I know is only interested in just grammar. No pronunciation guide at all! No index to help find things! I find this simply an inferior product. A much better buy would be Lliving Language French (beginning, intermediate, advanced). By contrast Living Language does it right--pronunciation, grammar, games. For me, Easy French Step by step was a waste of my money.
__label__2 Funny story lines: The entire cast is very funny and the story lines are believable. I did not give it five stars because of the ongoing immoral relationship between Coach Fox and Christine. This show is not for children.
__label__2 Must-reading for anyone Jewish or interested in Judaism: This book is an insightful, authoritative and comprehensive companion to anyone interested in learning more about Judaism. Well-written and thought-out, and full of some of the most frequently asked questions about Jewish rules, customs and more, "What Does Being Jewish Mean?" not only serves as an invaluable tool for educating children on Jewish laws, but it is without a doubt equally useful to adults. If you've ever had a question about any facet of Judaism or Judaic law, "What Does Being Jewish Mean?" is your answer.
__label__2 MC5 - 'Teen Age Lust' (Total Energy) 4 1/2 stars: I've said it before and I'll surely say it again. I just love these unreleased archive concert performances released on CD. Specially when it's of a tour / gig that you wouldn't ordinarily expect. This ten track gem was recorded on January 1, 1970 at the Civic Center in Saginaw, MI. It's sound quality is between very good to excellent. Several MC5 treasures included in the set, just sounds so much better when played live. Most notable cuts are the title track "Teen Age Lust", "Looking At You", "Human Being Lawnmower" and the foot-stomping "Black To Comm" which is squeezed into a medley with "Starship" and "Kick Out The Jams". Guitarist Fred Smith steps up to provide the vocals on "Shakin' Streets". This version kicks ass!! Nice cover.
__label__2 Crisp, beautiful display.: You might already know that this is the same LCD panel used in Apple's 20" Cinema display. The most noticeable difference between the two is that Apple's 20" LCD has admittedly superior cosmetic styling. This monitor is beautiful, sharp, and crisp and based on personal experience I believe it is brighter than the Apple model as well. Actually this is so bright I had to turn the brightness way down to comfortably use it, whereas on the Apple model I always had it turned all the way up.I actually originally got a 22" LG LCD and returned it shortly after purchase and got this instead because of a bad pixel and warped housing. I swear, every time I have tried to get a bigger monitor than 20" I have trouble. I wonder if 20" is just the sweet spot for large LCD's. I have had some type of trouble with every LCD monitor larger than 20". No trouble with this one. It's beautiful in every way.
__label__1 'Boo..' are you scared now? yes? then read this book!: This starts as a great book but fall flat after couple of pages. There are too many loose threads and very confusing book. Now a days writing confusing horror book is a fashion or what? I will tell you, if you HAVE to read this book, keep store receipt handy to return this book. Most of the matirial in this book is laughable! LOL. If someone says 'boo' to you in day light, in front of 1000 people,telling you that he is going to tell you 'boo' and if you get scared after that,then you will love this book.
__label__1 Mr.Kimball gets stupider than ever before: Actor Alvy Moore (Mr. Kimball) must've been very much in need of money to raise his family and care for his wife to allow the show's writers to make County Agent Kimball even more obliivious and dense in season two of Green Acres than the characier was in season one. He's aggravating as hell by now . `
__label__2 Best book in it's class: Over several years, I have purchased around a dozen books on MFC, and this one by far is not only the best one for learning MFC, but also the best to use as a reference (in addition to MSDN). Some of the examples were a little lengthy, as I prefer shorter examples. The first half of the book is essential for any windows programmer. The second half leans more towards particular advanced topics which are not needed by everyone, but good to have handy when the time comes.
__label__1 Where's the truth, Mr. Moore?: Unreal. This "documentary" is filled with so many half-truths and deceptions that is leaves you speechless. Moore is, by his own admission, on a mission to oust President Bush, no matter the cost. Leaving all pretense of balance aside, he picks and chooses and distorts to paint a picture of Bush that ends up looking nothing like the real man. If you are a dyed-in-the-wool liberal, you will love this film. If you are conservative or an independent thinker, you will see this for what it is . . . a cheerleading film for liberal-minded folks.
__label__1 not the same: this product is not similar to the one i buy at petsmart or petco the smell does not have that hydrogen sulphide smell idon't know what i got
__label__1 Night of the Living Dead remake: I thought that the movie could have been a lot better. The acting was somewhat to be desired but it did have a couple of shocking moments.It reminded me to much of night of the living dead with a little twist on the zombies.....rage..... I thought that Night of the Living dead was far better. God I hope they don't make a sequel to this movie.
__label__2 Great knife until blade play.: I have had this knife for almost a year now. When I received this knife i was amazed by how well it opened. This knife is great when you only have one spare hand to use .It was great until the vertical blade play. Which isn't really a problem because I use it as an EDC Knife and don't throw any heavy tasks at it.
__label__1 clasic julie classic broadway: this is not one orf her best recordings, her voice is not what is used to be, buy only if you're a true follower of her. nelson
__label__1 lousy ending after all that: a long road of story with a weak and disappointing pay off, and none really to speak of. bill nigh is too old for the role, should be played by daniel craig re age range. david hare some good dialogue and sparks fly but the final moments/decisions let the viewer down with a upper crust boring thump. too bad. has/had promise. but the the story doesn't deliver. in the end, rather dated despite the veneer of current, albeit 2008, headlines. a poor man's james bond without the action!
__label__1 Wholly boring, not Holy!: Woah! Boring alert! I don't know if you guys have heard of this book, but it is VERY long and boring. It also seems like a lot of stuff is definitely made up so I don't know why it's in the "non-fiction" section. Basically, this man Jesus is amazing. That's the whole story. But it goes on and on and on unnecessarily! "Joseph begat Abraham, Abraham begat Isiah..." on and on. Some editing would have definitely helped.Someone needs to bring out some cliff notes on this thing or something.
__label__1 No one to root for in this formula novel!: The lack of a sympathetic character made this book hard to finish - the only thing that kept me going was the fact that I'd bought it in hardcover. The Mary Higgins Clark formula plot did not work this time around, especially at the end with a most anti-climactic confrontation scene. A big disappointment.
__label__1 It was required for part of a course I had for my Master's Degree.: I really just used very little of this book for part of a course I took during my Master's Degree... it's kind of OK, but I did not really like it very much.I did, however, keep it - for whatever that is worth.
__label__1 Bad purchase.: I was truly, truly disappointed with my purchase of this dvd. The idea behind the dvd is great, but the actual content was not so great. My main problem with the dvd was that it flew through the positions so fast that you could not keep up with it. I was hoping this would be relaxing and sensual for my partner and me, but it ended up being stressful because we were just trying to keep up with the moves. It might work if you are looking for some positions, but do not need step by step guidance. However, this dvd is not appropriate for those who need more direct and clear guidance through the positions.
__label__2 Good then...good now.: I love the Muppets, ask anyone of my friends...and I love their interpretation of the classic. I personally get tired of remake after remake of old classics, but when the Muppets re-did this movie, it was if I was six years old again watching my favorite Muppet pals.Michael Caine is wonderful as Scrooge, Gonzo is a great Charles Dickens and Kermit is a heartfelt Bob Cratchit.The DVD has some great extra features, primarily an interview with Brian Henson, in which he is joined by Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat. There are also some snippits of an interview with Caine as he relays his first experience of working with the Muppets, great stuff.
__label__1 Disappointed: Nice looking watch, a little small. It worked for 12 hours, went to a jeweler to replace battery (needs a special tool to open) jeweler replaced battery it still did not work. Returned & Amazon gave a full refund.
__label__1 Gave me Bad Gas: This fiber gave me very bad bloating, gas and more pain. It constipated me even more. Maybe it will work for somebody out there, but not me.
__label__1 Horrible Book Distributor.: It was horrible, the book was beaten up, and it was advertised for a total of '6' books, and I only received one. >:-(
__label__1 Strange: Started off okay, however, it soon turned very strange. Set in the late 1800's, but too many items and phrases mentioned throughout are more modern-day. The 'genie' was just over the top for what could've been a decent historical romance, and I skimmed to the end after he poofed his way into the story. It's sort of harlequin meets aladdin. Not my style, but other's apparently enjoy it.
__label__1 Surprisingly Disappointed.: The title of the story doesn't match its content. It should be called "Trials of a Mother/Daughter Relationship". The storyline was really very boaring and the characters are "RECYCLED" from Til You Hear From Me. I chose this book as the topic of discussion for our girlfriends getaway, everyone agreed the book fell way short of expectations...
__label__2 For the Christian Couple's Nightstand: Another vulnerably honest, poetic, daily-living tool from the Wangerin pen... this time, however, delight in hearing from both Wangerins. My husband and I were looking for some help in learning how to pray together (I longed to overcome my awkwardness with praying aloud), and in one of those on-our-knees moments, found this to be just the tender nudge we needed. In a candid style that seems to characterize both Thanne and Walter, the prayers will assuredly give voice to a spectrum of painful and joyous times in the life of a Christian couple. It is a dynamic reference allowing a couple to find easily a prayer language of their own and includes suggestions for private retreat, litanies, and devotions to enrich any married couple seeking to grow together in Christ. The moving Foreward nearly stands alone, but we plan to pair PRAYERBOOK with AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE for wedding gifts.
__label__1 Poor sound quality - horrible customer service: KEEP YOUR RECEIPT - AFTER YOU WAIT FOR 30 MIN ON HOLD FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY WILL DO NOTHING FOR YOU WITHOUT YOUR RECEIPT IT IS THERE ESCAPE CLAUSE FOR THE POOR QUALITY PRODUCT THEY PUT OUT. AFTER 6 MONTHS MY EXTRA HANDSETS STARTED CLICKING AND POPPING, I CONTACTED UNIDEN AND WAS FRUSTRATED BEYOND BELIEF, LUCKILY I HAD MY RECEIPT SENT THE PHONES (0N MY DIME) TO THEM AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS THEY SEND ME TO REFERBISED FACTORY PHONES, BOTH DID NOT WORK, CALLED AGAIN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SEND ME TWO MORE, THEY NEVER CAME, WHEN i CALLED THEY SAID THE SECOND ORDER DID NOT HAVE A RECEIPT ATTACHED TO IT SO THEY DID NOT SEND THE PHONES, PS HAVE NOT HAD PHONES FOR OVER A MONTH AND STILL WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENTS.
__label__1 did not like it: did not like it. it being DELTA FORCE BLACK FORCE DOWN on the XBOX. All points made by Poor port to XboX are spot on. Delta force comes across like it needed about another years worth of work doing on it, the game feels rushed and the action dated.
__label__1 Ho Hum: Unfortunately, the wait was not because they were doing a better job....This movie is a fairly recent movie, compared with, let's say, "Out of Africa", but the work done to make it Blu-ray was not well done. I have both movies and I would say that the original is a better representation of what the movie requires. The Blu-ray, in this case, did not add any clarity to the grandeur of the landscapes, nor enhance the softer character lighting. This movie is a classic and requires more than what was given it. I am greatly disappointed that the tech people did not figure that out before working on it....
__label__2 Problems with this camera Kodak DC 3400: I use this camera in my line of work...so I probably take more pictures than the average person. It is a good camera...and may be the best for the hobby shooter. There are 2 flaws with this model...first one being the 'battery cover door'. They break easily...especially if you happen to put the batteries in backwards and try to force the door close as my grandkids attempted. The other problem is the 'flash'. I'm not sure if it is the flash strobe or the flash capacitor that goes bad....but either way...the flash stops working. At first it's only a missing flash here and there...then complete failure...which makes me believe it is the capacitor going bad. Other than these 2 problems....they are really tough camera and can take a lot of abuse ( drops of 3 to 4 feet )without any damage other than batteries popping out.
__label__1 Lord John and the Private Matter: Being a big Diana Gabaldon fan, having read the Outlander series, some of the book twice, Lord John and the Private Matters was a total waste of time and money. I liked Lord John Gray in the other books but he was as unnecessary to the plot (but I give the book too much credit by suggesting that there actually was a plot) in Private Matters as the rest of the charcters, and I doubt anyone reading the story felt the least pang of regret that the two murder victims no longer inhabitated their world.
__label__2 I like the book: The book very good to read. Like to have this book also for my own library.This is very good deal.
__label__2 Not bad at all!: I've listened to the CD about 4 times now and I can honestly say it's growing on me. Like I Love You is a great song and is worth buying the album for, but he's put together an album that has a lot of variety and is a lot of fun. My personal favorites are Rock Your Body and (And She Said) Take Me Now as they're both more upbeat songs. Cry Me a River is pretty soulful and is an interesting song since it seems to mirror the ending of a relationship he had with a certain famous pop star. This guy has a lot of talent and I think we'll be seeing a lot more from him over the years. Worth the money to add to your collection!
__label__1 to difficult to use: We purchased this for our daughter who saw one in a store that we could not get her out of it. Of course then when we bought it and got it home, the wheels do not turn easily! Even with us having to push her around constantly in it, we have to keep bending over to straighten the wheels.A real waste of money. And very frustrating for her and us!
__label__2 Good Quality Furnace Blower: The furnace blower in our central HVAC unit started making a noise. They wanted over $150 for a mew one at the local supply house. I found this blower here on Amazon for less than half that price. I ordered it and it showed up at my door in less than a week. It looks almost identical to the original blower and came with a new gasket and a tube of high-temp silicone to seal it to the existing duct work. Installation time was about 30 minutes. It is quiet and works perfectly. I believe the quality of this blower is equal to the original blower. All in all, this is a great deal if you can do you own work.
__label__1 What?????: $3.50 sounds like a decent price. When the item was placed in my cart the price increased to $11.40. I didn't review all the prices for each item in my cart. When I received the pakage and invoice I discovered the shenanigans. It was too late. Amazon said I could return shipment, but I needed the item and it was such a small amount of money when you add up shipping to and from my address it was not worth returning. What a rip-off!!!!!! Keep your eye on any purchase made through Amazon from Grizzly Tools(The marketplace seller in this case). Thanks Grizzly.
__label__2 Gingerguy/Gingerguy: This is the best oral irrigator that I have ever owned. It was very easy to install too. Works as advertised...how refreshing! Should also mention that the service was excellent and rapid.
__label__1 not their best offering: their older music, re: respect, sing, i need you, ect., was much better. very dissapointed, their a much better band than this effort shows.
__label__1 Disappointed?!: King's synonymous to horror fiction but unfortunately, it's otherwise this time round - disappointed despite the raves about his book. Instead of page-turning, it lulls you to sleep.
__label__1 Dull: If you are into lots of empty flowery words with no strong story or interesting characters then perhaps you will enjoy this book, otherwise stay clear. Overall impression, this book is merely colorful waffle. Very disappointing.
__label__2 Nice, but edges are weak: My 3 year old daughter loves doing puzzles, but she never could put together a normal puzzle. She just loves these little wooden ones, and she can put them together much easier than a normal one. The only thing that is bad with this one for me, was some of the pieces had the picture pulling up from the wood. It wouldn't be a big deal, but since they are little they like to pull it the rest of the way. With stronger glue, it should hold and be good as new.
__label__1 Meh.: While the guitar is okay, it has quite a few errors.The amp just sucks. It's noisy and basic.There is a huge amount of fret buzz.The amp overall gives it a thin, papery sound. I upgraded to a decent fender amp and it sounds much better.The frets cut my fingers when I do slides. Which is bad, because in my band (we play death metal) I use alot of slides.
__label__1 Little or No Examples: I found this book very difficult to follow along without a teacher to explain. Little or no examples. Book is full of proofs. This would be a perfect book for a person to brush up on there skills and review the material.
__label__1 Just a note to Akina Vasil....: Okay, book four of the thoroughbred series is Ashleigh's Victory; Ashleigh's Dream is book five. Furthermore, Ashleigh was barely 16 when she rode Wonder in the Breeder's Cup, she WOULD, in fact, have been around 18 or 19 when she was racing Pride.Oh yes, and this book was rather pointless as well. Ugh!! I have never liked Christina to start and this is yet another example of her egotism. Why does Christina always think she is right? Mind, I bet Star could have benifited from time on the trails, maybe a short gallop outside.
__label__2 A classic love story!: Wonderfully acted by a young Brooke Shields! The male lead was great too and of course the classic song with the same title!
__label__1 This is the worst book I've ever read.: I was forced to read this book in fifth grade. It's awful! The two main characters are far too childish. When I was eleven, I never went about creating "magical lands". Kids hear too much of nasty words already, they shouldn't get more by read this book. It was overall unenjoyable, and the dull plot did not help the lame characters, and idiotic fantasy-land! I've read other books by Katherine Paterson and I hated those too!
__label__1 Bear witness to the end of days.: In 1999 , a prophecy is fortold that the dark angel is loose from his prison.But leave it to the hero to challenge satan.In the ultimate war of good vrs evil.A very rugged Arnold who is battling personal problems diffrent than anything hes ever done,but a lack luster script and formula action kills this movie off.Good options but you don't just get a movie for the options just not one of his best but a fun movie to watch rent it don't buy it.
__label__2 Catchy music, lots of learning, great fun = FANTASTIC tape: My kids love it, I enjoy it. Fun songs that teach you about great people in American history - chugging along Harriet Tubman's underground railroad, light bulbs flashing in the head of Edison. A good mix of women and men. One of the best tapes my kids (18 mo - 9 years) have. I have often given it as presents and get the same feedback.
__label__1 SICK,That is all I can say about this movie!!!!!: What a sick movie ,pure hate against woman.Anybody who can set throu a rape scene like this is SICK them self !!!!!
__label__2 ANOTHER IMPORTANT BOOK IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE SCOPE OF IT!!: Another important book, of which there are many, if you want to know anything of the variety of UFO investigators and depth of subject matter on the subject. Billy has been maligned alot, which ought to tell you something!! This researcher follows up from other very reputable ones like Col. Wendelle Stevens, German researcher Michael Hesseman, John Mack, Budd Hopkins, Dr. Claude Swanson, etc. etc. Get serious, so you don't get left behind!!
__label__1 Battery died after 3 recharges: I have purchased Nikon D80 from ebay and this battery (last time buying non original batteries) from BestBuy. After first charge battery life was pretty short (less than 100 photos without flash). I told myself "fine, you can't expect non original battery to be perfect". After 3 recharging cycles battery died completely. Still I was not sure who is culprit: my used camera or the brand new battery. I searched Internet, cleaned the battery and camera as people advised. Nothing helped. Then I ordered new original battery from Hong Kong for $60 (compared to $100 in Toronto). In couple of weeks new battery arrived. After 3 weeks of extensive use no problems. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with the camera. Sadly, it is too late for returning it to bestbuy.Conclusion: stay away from non original batteries, in case you can't afford the price in Canada do shopping in Asia.
__label__2 Good Intro to Ponds: This book was very helpful answering questions about pond and filter construction, pumps, fish, etc. He answers all of the basic questions and offers ideas and solutions to things you've never thought of if you are a beginner.
__label__1 Mood Muzak: There seems to be nothing here to stir the senses with "Beautiful Day". The recording ability should be questioned. The inability to capture an original style is aloof. I'm am not sure what this artist is projecting as far as style. I give it 2 stars for effort.
__label__2 great purchase: i bought this for my hubby ... he is such big fan of this band.... he enjoyed it sooo much....it was a great buy....You should try it too :)
__label__1 Warranty (and Kindle) Worthless: Wow - I went from being a big fan to very unhappy in the space of a morning. My kindle (with cover) was bumped off my nightstand and fell onto the carpet - and the screen shifted. Amazon's answer is that this is a common problem, but that I need to pay a $200 service charge to get a new one as this is not a manufacturing defect.If the Kindle is so brittle that it breaks from a very minor incident like this, it is not worth the money. Nice technology, but I feel really ripped off.Ex-Fan
__label__2 WAS UNABLE TO FIND IN MY AREA AMAZON HAD IT.: I KNOW MOST PRODUCTS MADE TODAY ARE PLASTIC OR PLATED ZINK LOOK ALIKES BUT SEVERAL YEARS A GO I GOT A COBBLERS NAIL HOLDER CAST IRON, IT WAS SO RUSTED THE NAILS USED FOR ATACHING HEELS TO SHOES WERE ATACHED TO THE SIDES OF THE SCULPTED SIDES OF THE HOLDER IN BALLS OF RUST. I USED THIS PRODUCT TO REMOVE THE RUST AND LIGHTLY SANDED IT, PRIMERED AND SPRAY PAINTED IT BACK TO BLACK, MY SON SAW IT AFTER THE PROCEDURE, HE WAS SHOCKED THAT IT WAS THE SAME ITOM. THIS STUFF WILL NOT FIX THINGS THAT ARE RUSTED THROUGH BUT IF YOU WANT TO TAKE OFF SURFACE RUST THIS STUFF REALY WORKS.
__label__1 It was passable while it lasted: Before it died, this was an acceptible camera. Unfortunately the automatic lens features fell apart and Fuji refuses to fix it without a store receipt AND the warranty card. It's unreasonable to refuse to fix obvious manufacturing defects.In particular, the automatic lens cover doors no longer function, and the lens will not zoom. Since the lens cover won't open, the camera's as good as dead.I'm thoroughly unhappy with Fuji's customer service, and this camera is to be avoided.
__label__1 BEES ? BEES?!?!?! yeah right..: I disliked this book on so many levels..first of all..BEES kill people all the time, and i dont think its right to glamorize these horrific monsters, most of the time they are killing BABIES, all types of babies. newborn babies, asian babies. just babies of all types. another thing is that bees dont really have a sexret life, i mean who is gonne believe that filth..BEES? SECRET LIFE..yeah right. bees dont need a secret life..because we all know what bees do..they make honey. buzz around and viciously slaughter our newborns..so i dont think anyone that actually has a heart..should read this book..take it from me!
__label__2 Almost Complete: The amazon.com reviewer is right. This compilation is missing two great singles "This Used To Be My Playground" and "American Pie." Another complaint is that the single radio version (Miami Remx) of "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" is not included--it's the soundtrack album version. But still a good buy for Madonna fans. A-
__label__2 FOR ALL AGES: This movie is one to be passed down from generation to generation. It is human nature in its buff from parent to child and of course the age old question of "Why?" It's a must see!
__label__2 Worth Your Time: No it isn't Grisham, but then his books are getting more Danielle Steelish every time. It's well written, well plotted, realistic characters (I liked the homely female judge-I know several just like her), thoughtful, and didn't throw me out of the story thinking "that could never happen in a real case" (I am a lawyer)
__label__2 works great for me.: I have been using this product for over 4 years and I love it. I have uneven skin tone around the mouth area and its gotten a lot lighter. My face feels smooth and radiant. I also love the small microbeads in it to exfoliate my skin. I read some reviews about it helping acne. It's not an acne treatment so don't get mad if it doesn't work for you. It's not for all skin type. So try it out if u like it and it works for u great. If not try something else.
__label__1 Not that good, there are better: This is not a very good book of Joan Chittister, the book feels dated and the thought patter is scattered. I thought for sure it was written in the early 1970s with the political bent and anti-traditionalist religious life feeling. The references to her young nun life in a community pre-molestation by experiments, is interesting as those are the very communities that are growing. "Sister" Joan has better books; Rule of St. Benedict Insights for the Ages is superior to this particular effort. Look for that book instead.
__label__1 Bad Dog! Bad Author!: I thought it was ok, like other reviews said. For a free book (buy 3 or 4 of under $10 books, get one free), I can live with it. And some of the stories are head-shakers ("I can't believe this."). But if I had paid $10 out-of-pocket for it, I would be annoyed. Some of the stories are pretty cute; actually got a smile out of me. But I agree that the writing in 1st person from the POV of the dog can be pretty annoying.
__label__2 Never Finish Your Business: The second album from Erick and Parrish, a must own classic. Super tight with their beats and rhymes.
__label__1 I really want to like this CD: I think maybe I'm not hip enough to like this CD. I really want to like it. I've listened to it several times. I'm trying really hard to figure out what he's trying to say. Maybe I'm not deep enough. So many people are saying this is such a great CD and so much like his first one. Huh? I understood the first one. This one, not so much. I read the reviews trying to find out what I'm missing and still I don't get it. Maybe I should find the lyrics and then I'll understand what he's saying. I'm hoping it will grow on me and maybe '9 Crimes' is starting to, but the others not so much. Overall, a big disapointment.
__label__2 Additional Cartridges: Many of the reviews request additional cartridges. A local toy store informed me that a large number of new cartridges will soon be issued by the manufacturer.
__label__1 Product is a bust: This product did not work for my player at all. It is in the same state it was before I used the cleaner. I do not reccomend.
__label__1 Great book if you want to LOSE YOUR SHIRT: BE WARNED, click on the author's name link. He's the same BOZO who was telling people how they could get rich on tech stocks in a book published in MARCH OF 2000!!! Whatever this guy says to do, DO THE OPPOSITE and you should be fine.
__label__1 The paper is fine; the backing is flimsy: There is nothing wrong with the paper in these pads, that I've seen -- I tend to use legal pads by flipping back the pages, not tearing them out -- but the problem lies in the lack of any stiffness to the backing cardboard. It is thin and very flexible. If you're writing on a desk, fine. But if you're writing on your knee, or freestanding, you're going to have problems.
__label__1 Outdated and prejudiced: The only useful part of this book was the beginning chapters which talked about Rigdon's early work with Campbell and Scott. Otherwise, it is just an anti-Joseph view of Mormon history. I found much more useful information in Bushman's Rough Stone Rolling.
__label__2 Love these: I like these much better than the metal rings. They are dishwasher safe and all one piece. I think they look nice too!
__label__1 IGNORANT AUTHOR, TERRIBLE BOOK: Unbelievably, Quennan says on page 69 of his book that the Cincinnati Reds were "suprise winners of the 1991 World Series". This is of course disgustingly ignorant of him because the Twins won that series and it was undisputably the greatest world series of all time (according to ESPN)!! He goes on to say that the Oakland A's won in 1990 who actually won in '89 and lost in '88 and '90 for the record the reds won in 1990. WHAT A LOSER DON'T READ HIS PIECE OF CRAP.
__label__1 The tape snapped.: The tape snapped five minutes after I put it in my machine. My VCR is brand new. It's not the machine. I had to pull it out of my machine. Not good. I realize the tape is used but if it doesn't work, it's useless. I won't buy from you again.
__label__1 This book is crap.: Fortunatly I did not have to pay to read this sophmoric peice of self-indulgent flatulence. It is the ramblings of an overpaid NBA star masterbating his ego. I read the whole thing hoping there would be some redemption in the end but I wasted my time. Please don't waste your money. There are plenty of quality basketball books available. This is not one of them. Rodman my be a great player, but this book blows
__label__2 A Very Good Soundtrack: I recently saw this movie on the FLIX cable channel. Buying the soundtrack was an easy choice. I've been buying a lot of James Brown lately. I recommend the compilations "Motherlode" and "In a Jungle Groove" (both remastered!).There are a lot of excellent JB compilations and remastered albums available. Few of them are bad. The majority are great.This is a great album.It's not real long, but damn it's FUNKY. Enjoy.
__label__2 A MUST read for anyone interested in better health.: Susan lays it all out for you in this book. What you're eating, why you're eating it, why you shouldn't be eating it, what's in what you're eating, what is a better way to eat, the history of food.. So interesting!! She covers the additives that you can't pronounce and what they do to your system. There are delicious, healthy recipes throughout. Susan writes in layperson's terms and her material is easy to digest. I suggest getting a hard copy of this book, though, as the paperback I ordered is a little hard to read.. So many tiny words packed onto the pages.. Get the book! It's a great buy and a great read. You'll be amazed.
__label__2 Great Basic Case: If you are just looking for a case to protect your valuable camera, this is it! It looks good, is lightweight, and a great price. I just needed a case to store my camera in and make sure it didn't get banged and scratched when traveling with the camera, and this fits the bill exactly!
__label__2 Ideal book for costume designers...: This book is full of excellent 1st degree research. I have used it on multiple occassions to set me on the right track for doing intensive research on a variety of periods. It does lack a bit in non-Western costume, but the periods it does cover are done very well. Its a great reference book to have around.
__label__1 5000 series cutter blade: blade hard to snap in place, not as sharp as the original blade also if you turn blade to rinse it it pops out. the price is good, but i think you should replace the foil & the blade but that costs $25 to $35.HH
__label__2 This is a great workout :): This is a fantastic low impact workout that really gets your heart a pumpin. I originally had this in VHS format but wore it out so i'm anxiously awaiting the delivery of my new DVD format lol. Even if you get used to this workout and feel as if you aren't huffing and puffing enough to burn off many calories you can always add arms even when Kathy isn't or if you really want to kick your butt add some light strap one leg weights!
__label__2 Thoughts Become Things ! ! !: lots of ramblings about positive and negative vibrations, metaphysics, and laws of attraction, blah, blah, blah. Take those parts just on entertainment value. BUT... there are practical, actionable messages in this video about grooming and controlling your thoughts ... which is the key to unlocking any positive potential in your life.Two biggest messages of the book are:1) Thoughts become things -- both negative and positive.2) Inner happiness is the fuel of success.~Kyle
__label__2 near extraction: Few things will surprise you and then you relax. enter drums and focused atmosphere.
__label__2 Very pretty scarf: I am an amateur --just a cardio class with belly dancing. This scarf is very pretty and has a nice jingle!
__label__2 You don't have to know hockey: One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment.
__label__2 Volkerball: Great sound, great visuals, would have given this five stars if it hadn't been for to many shots of divs in the crowd ( you know who you are ) plus some glaring omissions track wise, no Mann Gegen Mann, Rosenrot,Spring, Spielhur, Engel or Armour. Apart from that top notch.Ian Birch
__label__2 Useful strategy book: Unlike many organizing books which are filled with useless bits of advice, this book outlines a high-level conceptual approach to getting and staying organized. I found it invaluable. For me, the key insight is that disorganization stems from life events that make your previously-adequate organizing strategies become suddenly (or slowly) ineffective. I also like the broad approach that she takes, where organziation extends beyond where you put your stuff to your time, space, finances, etc. $12 is a small price to pay for a book that has the potential to transform your life in a positive and practical way.
__label__2 crock water spout: The product worked perfectly. the shiping was fast. Had a wonderful expericence with amazon. Thank you again
__label__1 So you wanna be a loser?: Hard to tell where to start...The correct way to play each hand without counting cards (called Basic Strategy) has now been known for over 40 years. Amazingly, this book dismisses these facts and recommends well over a dozen mistakes in their place. To put into perspective how bad this book is, John Patrick actually recommends splitting a pair of fives against a dealer's six.His book is replete with coupons and offers to play in different casinos in Atlantic City and Nevada. This fact alone, that fact being casinos are BEGGING you to come play at their tables and play blackjack the John Patrick way, should tell you everything you need to know about a John Patrick gambling system.There are many good books in the Amazon listing. This book is definitely among the very worst of the WORST of them, rivaled only by John Patrick's other gambling writings as to which one comes in last place.
__label__1 Should be Zero Stars: Quackery of the highest order. Not one of the good "Dr's" "scientific" arguments has ever been peer reviewed. Satinover is scientific like creationism is scientific -- NOT. Pseudoscience of the worst sort. Pure unadelterated garbage for the gullible Xtian fundamentalist.
__label__1 new special edition sucks: BEWARE THE TRANSFER IT'S STILL HORRIBLE AND THE ENCODING OF THE DVD HAS PLENTY OF DIGITAL ARTIFACTS. LOOKS TROMA JUST RIPPED OFF THE OZ DVD, I'LL CHECK ABOUT THIS AND POST MORE,AFTER I'LL GRAB THE OZ SPECIAL EDITION. I WAS MISLEAD HERE CAUZ' I THOUGHT THAT THEY GOT THE NEW MATERIALS CREATED DOWN THERE, AND CAUZ' THEY HAD HERE EVEN A DIRECTOR'S INTRO.BY THE WAY BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK I'LL TRY TO BE REFUNDED.
__label__2 Good book: The first half of the book was rather uneventful but the last 300 pages or so was amazing... This series is getting more and more grown up and is no longer a kids book only. The death of perhaps one of the most loved characters was a bit shocking to me... however, this was another great book by Ms. Rowling... the last few pages make it seem like this could be the last book that she will write but i certainly hope not... i am anxiously looking forward to the 7th book...
__label__1 Nonstick finish not in it for the long haul: Have owned this pan for about five years, and really liked it at first. I'd hoped it would last a very long time, given the new-formula, supposedly sturdy, nonstick finish, as well as its strong stainless steel clad construction. But the nonstick surface has been progressively peeling off around the rivets for the past couple of years, not anywhere we use utensils. It's just plain surface failure, and we don't want it in our food. The degradation of the nonstick surface is all the more disappointing because this pan seems otherwise to have everything else going for it.
__label__1 I'm not the only one!: I thought I was the only fan who was unhappy with my DVD of "Life at the Greek"!! This makes me so sad because I love Josh's voice. Since I'm also studying voice he was a role model. Now Josh seems to be just another rock star now that he's let his voice go for sure. I can hear the strains and my teacher would too. Josh just needs to re-train his voice to get the quality back. He truly sounds better in his first concert.
__label__2 Works well, but...: I have never used a burr grinder before and it's nice not to have beans that don't get ground. The difference between fine and coarse is too subtle to see any difference, with the coarse being too fine. I have adjusted the amount of coffee used to make up the difference in flavor. I am a little disappointed in it.
__label__1 Its begining good - for a month!!!: It was a really great for like a month! Then it started to not have network conections and you can't make phone calls. Then we tried a new "smartchip". It wasn't that smart. It was horrible! We the n sent out for a new phone and they sent us the same phone and 2 months later i broke! We were so mad. We talked to them and they gave me a Motorola v557! I would not try his phone at all!! It was so bad. You'll regret it later.
__label__2 audio-techniica M30 headphones: Audio-Technica has an excellent reputation in the headphone industry. The phones are quite comfortable and I have worn them for up to 6 hrs. without fatigue. The extra length 10 ft cord has a strain relief at both plug and phone end, and I can reach from the receiver to my easy chair without using an extension. Sound is natural, not overly bright, but it is lacking a bit of bass.
__label__2 AWESOME!!: aaron carter proved that he can rap, and in his cd "oh aaron" he proved that he can sing as well. this cd, which feat. songs with his brother nick carter, is a great addition to anyone's collection of cd's. my fav song has got to be "i'm all about you" a song that many teens can relate too. hopefully he will continue to produce great music in the years to come, i'm waiting for his next cd!!
__label__2 The Encounter (Forbidden Doors #06): i just would like to say that these books have taught me more and have allowed me to understand better the truthfulness of spiritual warfare. they also showed me to not take it lightly. i just got injured verry seriously and i haven't been able to do anything, that was untill i started to read those books, i have not been able to stop... in other words they are a series that not only teaches you but also they are taking an important tole to teach kids to be cautious and to know that this is how the real world is and that we should no cover up from our children and fellow class mates the truth.
__label__1 Beware!: Don't make the same mistake I did. This is not the same "Ron Carlson" who is best known for his short stories, but another author by the same name. This is a actually a book of "humorous" Christian essays, i.e.nonfiction. Nothing wrong with that, but it ain't what I was expecting.The other review posted here is obviously written about another book and is posted here in error.
__label__1 Many errors, poor review questions: This book is poor. I scored a low 79% on the tests, but found that many of the answers provided were just plain wrong.I was irritated that it required me to install Windows to install the quiz questions from the CD.It failed to mention clearly that during installation, selecting the packages required for kernel compilation saves a lot of time (I forgot that in the exam!)The copy I bought (year 2000) was very out of date, referring to RH 6.0, whereas current tests are at 7.1, which is quite different.I will pass my copy on to our College library, but I am not sure that it will benefit my students very much.
__label__1 not what i expected: this has one 'dance' routine. for the money there should have been more. very moderate pace. short explanation about taking heart beats per minute. way over priced considering it only contains one 'dance'. slow enough for a beginner.
__label__2 I really enjoyed the movie!!!!: Personally I enjoyed the movie. I found it rather interesting and it caught my attention being that I am a Georgia native. I am about two hours from Savannah and was familiar with some of the happenings. I was truly amused with the Lady Chablis. I've watched this movie more than once and I purchased it through Amazon.Com. I enjoyed the movie though I thought that it needed a little work.
__label__1 What Happened?: When I saw on Napster that Snow Patrol had a new release, I sat in front of the computer for an hour. Final Straw has to be one of the most perfect albums ever released, but this doesn't even sound like the same band (much less the same singer). Talk about generic, the opener "You're all I have" is so standard, with obvious lyrics and and the same 3 chords, you'd think 13 year olds would have written it in their garage. Nothing grabs you on this disc, and when it does, something goes horribly wrong. On "Shut your eyes" the spare guitar line reels you in, and the lyrics are intensely intimate; an entreaty only to you, the listener. Then the entire chorus of 20 people (not professional singers) enters the scene and ruins the mood. The rest is bland, bland, bland. "It's beginning to get to me" is a bright spot, though, but not enough to save this repetitive non-effort.
__label__1 Wrong size: Have ordered this item 3 different times, 3 different sizes and not one of them has matched the description given on the website or on the box. This does NOT fit all 4 passenger carts. It measures only 85" long.
__label__1 Choosing a Cruising Sailboat???: My review is simply that this book was mis-titled. It should have read Designing a Cruising Sailboat not Choosing. It speaks less of real boats and more about 4-5 mythical boats of which the author walks you through the design process of. If you've got lots of cash and want to see your custom design come to life this book may be for you. The author even goes so far as to say that proper boat maintenance starts when you visit your boat builder while your boat is being built and blah blah...at this point I considered the book a loss.
__label__1 Worst Magazine Ever!: I don't know who could possibly like this magazine. If you are into fad diets then this magazine is for you, otherwise don't waste your money.
__label__1 Not as represented: The photo of this cooler suggests its a short, wide little jug. The reviewers who used it for their dogs, which was my purpose in purchasing it, spoke very highly about it. The cooler I received was taller and narrower which would make my dog's ability to drink from it more difficult. Additionally, I was put off by the odor inside after the cap was screwed off. Wound up returning it. The shipping was more than the cost of the cooler, so I wound up paying approximately $18.00 for shipping (both ways) for a $10.00+/- cooler. Oh, well.
__label__1 Weakest Rizwan Muazzam Album: This is the weakest of the traditional Rizwan Muazzam albums. Firstly the recording quality is bad, it was recorded in pakistan and is extremely muted. The upper half of the frequency spectrum is completely absent.Nusrat fans will recognize song 1, which Nusrat called "To Karimi" which is on the "final recordings" album. The last song is the traditional "Rang Hai Nai". The rest are new Rizwan-Muazzam songs. There are seven songs on this cd, about 10 minutes each, which means they have to squeeze in the performances. This makes for lackluster performances of the songs here, not too much improvisation. The singers don't seem in improvising form during this recording.I'd recommend getting "Sacrifice to Love", for those who are just exploring this group.
__label__1 False Apostles: The unholy power of the one-minute manager repackaged into a seeker-sensitive, market-driven, ego-centric, swiss-cheese gospel message. 2 Corinthians 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
__label__2 Great Memories: I'm a big fan of this series, as soon as a I get it I started to watch it, great memories!! nothing like those 80's cartoons, you must have this, great price for all first season.
__label__1 Stolen idea: This novel is basically an expanded rip-off of Allan Danzig's short story "The Great Nebraska Sea," which was written in 1963. Williams could have done a lot more with a lot less. If length hath merit, Williams' novel hath no other.
__label__2 Bought a dozen: I ordered a dozen of these pans to use for an event. They worked great. The lids are a little hard to work with but I didn't need them for this purpose. The biggest drawback was that I couldn't stack the pans inside of each other. They became stuck together and it took awhile to work them back apart. If you are buying only one then this wouldn't be an issue.I would buy this product again. Even heat distribution, excellent depth and food didn't stick as long as I used oil and flour on the pan first.
__label__2 A very good live-record registred in a typical local.: I feel this record as a very well sung and the sound gives the true sensation of a typical local "balera", where around at the little orchestra and at the singer, people dance "the ballo liscio". A very good interpretation of Gigliola Cinquetti, her warm voice is right for this musical sort.
__label__1 BS: Whoever would even think of picking up this book after actually reding the reviews, must, as well as the author, have very little knowledge of what the word "wicca" even means. Unless your whole outlook on wicca consists of a dictionary definition of wicca, don't read this.
__label__1 Awful fit: I rarely ever buy bras online especially if it is not from the manufacturer that I am familiar with. I did this because of the price and it was money wasted. The bras fit as if it had been worn. Towards the middle of the cups on both sides were pockets where the cup was not filled out or was not shaped right. So it looked as if I need to put something it other than my fist. Useless. Has been sitting on my dresser going to Goodwill. Bad purchase. Bad fit. Pretty but not practical. I do have many demi unlined bras that fit well, this was not made for D+ women.
__label__1 Mamet is not the talent everyone would have you believe: After my wife and I forced ourselves to watch the whole thing through to the end, we did a quick mental review of all the Mamet films we could think of in order to try to figure out why we had had this idea he was such a great writer. American Buffalo, The Edge, Oleana (sp?), The Spanish Prisoner and, I think, State and Main. None of them are deserving of the reputation Mamet enjoys. The Spanish Prisoner is mildly interesting, I suppose, but none of the others fall anywhere near the top of my greatest films list.This movie was just a dull action film dressed up (and not very convincingly) as an art film or as something with intellectual appeal. The dialogue gets so fast and furious at points that, if it weren't for the all the frequent repetitions, you'd have to be rewinding all the time to hear what was said.We gave it our best effort, but in the end, we both agreed that we'll pass on any future Mamet productions.
__label__2 Garmin Portable friction Mount: It is just what I need, safe and out of ny eyes view. It was packaged well and also instructions included . thanks
__label__2 Great printer - fast, duplexing, USB and ethernet, easy setup: I picked one up used last week for $60 local with extra paper tray. On the Mac it was super easy setup.I just plugged it onto the the network went to System Preferences > Printers & Fax > then clicked on the + button to add a new printer. On the top of the list I saw Brother HL-5250DN bonjour" and I clicked on that and in a few seconds it found the drivers and set it up. Wicked. It prints even multi-page PDFs so quick that by the time I get upstairs (setup in my home office) it is already done and going into sleep mode. The whole printer cost less than a set of inks for my inkjet. It's not color but for making quick prints for directions, manuals, recipes etc it rocks.Cons:Brother's "photo mode" seems useless though and it is a little confusing how to setup the duplex part in the print dialog. I had to go online to the help section for that.
__label__1 Disappointed :(: I was looking for 3D movies to try out on my Nvidia PC upgraded with 3D Vision. This movie was not vary good to me kinda fuzzy and the story line was a snoozer. Alien Adventure was much better!
__label__2 Battery worked 100%; no issues: My 15 year old Panasonic cordless was becoming harder to hear. Thought I needed a new phone, when I realized maybe the battery was the issue. Searched for a replacement battery and this Lenmar Replacement battery worked 100% immediately and I now have a new phone again.
__label__2 Amazon not sending what they advertise: Ordered two of these 3A black leather racing seats....overall really nice...BUTwhat Amazon sent me was not what was advertised...They show a photo of a seat that has a lever that is usedto adjust the back position...down where the back meets the bottom...What Amazon sent me was a hand operated wheel that is almostimpossible to adjust without being out of the seat...Afterwards...when I emailed the problem to the Amazon's CS dept...they saidthat I would have to return these (at my expense)...Mailing back these seats is not an option, as they weigh almost 50 lbs...So they offered to refund 20% of the cost...which does help ease the pain some...but I wanted seats that had levers...not hand wheels...SO...the moral of the story is...make sure that Amazon guarantees that what they will sendis what is pictured...otherwise...Amazon cannot be trusted
__label__2 Good for the money...: This battery has lasted numerous flights for the past 4 years, no issues. It is often stored for months at a time, has always taken a charge providing 5 plus hours on a wide screen portable player. Keeps the kids happy, longer flights now, we are buying another.Technuity ERDVDMAX Battery, Universal Nimh for Portable
__label__1 deceiving........: Deceiving, a little too many changes in their sound.....perhaps too far-fetched.....a couple of good songs, though......'Firesign', 'Beat yourself blind', but nothing really talented.....
__label__2 Amazing Book!: The main characters Danica Shardae heir to the avian throne(who narates the story) and Zane Cobriana Diente to the serpebts; desperate to end the war that has been raging between their people for centuries, get married to bring peace to both their kingdoms. It is a loveless marriage. While the avians are restrained, and frown apun emotions, the serpents are offended if one does not express their feelings; and would not approve of their king choosing his bride for any other reason than love. So the two must act like lovers while trying to avoid fights among their people... not to mention assassins who disslike the bonding of the two royal families.I love this book it has a great plot, strong characters, and is so different than most teen fiction novels.
__label__1 Not working: I'm very sad, this movie is not playing correctly!! :( The voice and picture don't match up and are playing not in sync ONE bit!! :P
__label__2 Emerging Courage: This is a story about behavior molded and forced by tradition, yearning, realtionships and uncontrollable life events. Conscience is secondary to need until love triumphs; courage is absent until deadly consequence promises to be less painful than failure. Events guide toward reflection and change. The inability of youth to analyze or understand rings true, and the priceless ability to evolve through experiences is clear. Afghanistan was given life in the heart of this reader. Unconditional love and understanding without judgement is the key that opens the door of the heart.
__label__1 Not good for the soft-spoken, or the extended talker: I've got a very soft voice, so generally have to pick earpieces that pick up a lot. I was replacing aPlantronics mx150 Verizon wired Hands-Free w/ call end, answer & Voice Dialingthat I'd had for about 3 years. I chose this thinking it was going to be as good. Unfortunately, no one could hear me on it.As far as in the ear comfort goes, I thought it was going to be better than the under the lobe support. I normally talk for hours in the evening and I was getting a little bothered by the original one. Unfortunately, this was less comfortable, and I felt like I was getting an earache after a few days of using it. I tried to use the over the ear support but the little connector snapped the first time I tried to connect it. (And yes, I was trying to be careful.) Switching ears was a pain as well since you had to line up the inner part with the boom.Personally, I trashed this and bought another of the Plantronics when I upgraded my phone last month.
__label__2 Good Stuff: Value for money, extremely easy install ... great looks, love it .. anyone can install without any problem ..gave a new look to my entrance :-)
__label__2 This worked very well for me: This does help an irritated stomach/gastritis, esophagitis, or GERD. For me, I start to feel relief in about 10 minutes. I'll keep a bottle around the house from now on. I was skeptical at first, but now I'm impressed. Not a replacement for medications for GERD, but a nice adjunctive therapy.
__label__1 Conair BC84SCS 3/4 inch hot brush: I bought this item in October 2008 and it is now January 2009 and it already doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend it.
__label__1 Wrong edition - disappointing: Once son got to school, instructor said this was too old an edition. Thought ordered the 1994 edition but this is a much older 60's edition. Disappointed as now have to purchase another book and hope the correct one comes. will not use this seller again. Book does not even look like the pic noted . Thought it would be okay but too old and need to have the metric versions and the added drawings as in the newer book
__label__1 Disappointing and Overpriced: I can hardly believe this book is endorsed by RSA. Actually I purchased the book because of this endorsement. Alas, I'll be more careful in the future. For sure.Sorry to say this, but you can learn more on wireless security in the Readers' Digest than in this book.The issues are treated in a very naive way. Just 'generic outlines' (remember this book is 'worth' [money]).For instance, Spread Spectrum is discussed in about ONE and a half pages. WEP in just two half pages. WAP explanation is a mess (lousy mess).Even worse is chapter 10, 'real examples'. Several bad explained naive 'case studies', with no match between the figures and the 'related' discussions.Interested in Bluetooth security issues?. Well there is HALF page covering Bluetooth, not an inch more.Believe me, you can find worthier information, in a 5 minutes search through Internet.Lost my money ...
__label__2 if only it lasted longer...: I had mine exactly 3 years when it stopped heating the plates. The light would turn on, but the plates would stay cold, so I think it has something to do with the wiring. It happened when I took it on vacation, so it might have something to do with twisting and wrapping the cord around the handle (but what else are you supposed to do with it?)On the plus side, it's SUPER CHEAP, and it made my hair super straight and smooth. I like it much better than my friends' Sedu or Chi. I also like the scissor handles... I felt like it gave me more leverage to squeeze the plates together. It heated up in less than 30 seconds, and it held up through 3 years of a lot of travel and abuse. So for that reason, I'm going to buy it again... and maybe be a little more careful with it!
__label__2 A brilliant discussion on the ALH-84001 scientific debate: Apart from offering his great scientific expertise, Andrew Knoll provides a very through view of the evolutionary tracks that life has followed on our planet. However, what in my view what this book deserves praise for is the brief yet highly valuable discussion he provides on the debate of the meteorite ALH-84001. Not taking any of the debates sides he offers the reader an open minded and brilliant exposure of the subject cleaning up the many misconceptions put forth. In addition I truly liked his brief but to the point treatment of the very painful subject of Intelligent Design versus Science. These two chapters of the book are definitely worth reading.-Ihrenes 2006.
__label__1 Do Not Buy At All: I purchased this device to connect my NDS to my network. I've tried all of the advice I've read in the customer comments and was still unable to connect. I used it on a Windows 7 PC and on a Snow Leopard Mac. I've downloaded the various drivers from the company website and it still won't work to connect. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
__label__2 fun but easy: The fith installment in the tony hawk saga. This game there are new tricks, new skaters, and a new story mode into playing as yourself. Finally in this game your character can talk, not just have subtitles. There is a great story mode, and showing the life of a true skater. The real funny thing in this game is when your guy walks he looks like he is going to take a dump. But I really must comment on the graphics. Activision really did an amazing job developing this game. Also this game is a little more challanging than the other Tony Hawks. But I still think Tony Hawk 4 is the most challanging.If you haven't played this game, basically where have you been for the past 7 months?
__label__2 Bedtime Story - Marlon Brando is the greatest: I have seen several trailers of this movie and wish it was out on DVD. It is so funny and Marlon Brando is definitely a great comedic actor. Next to this one, the Countess of Hong Kong with Marlon Brando was a riot. Please put this one out on DVD.
__label__2 Kraftwerk-More than just into it!: Kraftwerk isn't just another techno. They invented it. I bought this CD the day it was US released in 1985, then it was on vinyl, I've since upgraded to CD of course. Play this CD with Dolby Surround and a sub and it will change you life... Buy it now! I have every US available Kraftwerk release and Boing isn't the best, where I rank Computerworld, but it is as usual, very well-produced and clean and original.
__label__2 Fantastic!: This looks great! Just what I needed and it looks like quality. Haven't put it up yet though, but looks straightforward. Includes mounting screws etc.

__label__1 Blah Christmas jazz compilation: Generic Christmas jazz compilation by no-name artists, good for playing in the background when you are wanting to focus your attention on something else. No vocals, completely instrumental. None of the songs stood out as special. I liked the cover artwork more than the CD itself.
__label__1 Don't buy it: It's a poorly executed movie. A unbelievably dumb story, poor visuals, poor character development, and Peter MacNichol can't act his way out of a wet paper sack. Buy a hamburger instead.
__label__1 worst shooter ever: i purchaced this game when it first came out thinking that it would be better than goldeye. But, almost emediatly i saw that there are only 10 short missions and unrealalistic game play. the only way that this game got 1 star is for the OK infered gun (highly inacutate) and the full auto 9mm. otherwise this game [is not good]. when using the sniper rifle, you miss every time by about 50 feet...
__label__2 The best of 2001: An absolute masterpiece: When watching this movie for the first time your initial reaction is gonna "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT"? After watching it again your gonna say "well I never noticed this before." After watching it a third time the thing you noticed before isn't gonna make a whole lotta sense because something is off with the scene. My point is for those of you trying to decipher this film and make sense out of it don't bother. When you think you have a grip on it something happens in the movie that turns it all upside down. I'm not gonna bother explaining any plot here, because it wouldn't do any good. This was the best movie of 2001.
__label__1 LEAKED: WHEN WE FILLED THE POT WITH WATER THE FIRST TIME, IT LEAKED ALL OVER THE COUNTER TOP & FLOOR.WE IMMEDIATELY PUT IT BACK IN THE BOX AND RETURNED IOT
__label__1 Extremely dissapointed: This book is indeed the worst book I have ever read from O'Reilly concerning Java programming. In fact I am considering donating my copy to a local garbage dump.The examples are not relevent to real life programming. And worst of all, after spending much time and energy painfully plowing through their poor explanations, they end the excercise by telling me that what they just taught me "won't work".Spending most of my time learning what "won't work" is not how I normally learn. In fact, I don't think that is how most people normally learn. It only succeeded in frustrating and discouraging me. Just tell me what will work and I will learn it and we will all be happy.
__label__2 Magic: A rich and magical little book. Well & uniquely written in the consistent voice of 14 yr old Lily, who has a such a wonderfully open and forgiving heart. (Thanks to the encouragement of the Boatwrights) I too, long for a sequel. What's to become of the sisters? And what is Lily like as an adult?
__label__1 Keep a leash on singer-songwriters: For some reason, singer-songwriters feel often feel compelled sometime in their career to unleash at full throttle the imagined majesty of their vocal range in a haze of discondordant cacophony. Phillips does this on this album - run don't buy!
__label__1 Whats all the rave?: I don't understand what all the rave for this book is. I had to read it for a class project and this book was a snooze. Now I know everyone who did enjoy this book is probably wanting to rip my eyeballs out of my head, but I wanted to give my opinion. I hated this book so much I never wanted to reopen it, I couldn't help put it down. It took me weeks to read this book when it usually only takes me 2 days to read a book. The book had really no plot, it rambled on and it felt like a huge run on sentence. There was a few good parts and when I started to get excited and then it made me want to throw it across the room.
__label__1 Misleading and disappointing: I have no idea what instrument is being used on this album, nor who is to blame for playing it, but I second the other reviewers who have criticized the tinny, painfully thin sound. It's a dreadful album - unlistenable.I bought this thinking that it would be a compilation of tunes played by music boxes. It's not. I wish there was some way I could return it just because of its sheer awfulness, but I doubt that's possible. I'd give it away, but I don't know anyone I dislike enough to give it to, so I'll probably drop it in a Goodwill box someplace - or maybe just the trash.
__label__2 5 Stars for this movie!: I saw this at the movie theater and liked it so much I purchased the DVD today. I would call this an entertaining and creative movie. The story line is original and fresh. The acting is great. If your stupid and think a movie about vampires should be historically accurate because the main character is Abraham Lincoln then this movie is not for you. Give this movie a chance! Sit down with a bowl of popcorn, plug in this movie and enjoy the ride! You will like it. It may be about vampires but I did not find it scary if that is a concern.
__label__2 Perfect: This filter works just as great as the expensive version. I use it solely to protect the glass on my lens.
__label__1 OVER PRICED CD: I cannot believe ANYONE could give give this CD 4 and 5 stars WITHOUT "Mad About You". And the biggest ripoff, is you cannot get "In Our Wildest Dreams" (From Mannequin) anywhere. Those are my two favorite Belinda songs, and until they come up with a CD that has "In Our Wildest Dreams", I will stick to the single disk. Simply put this is an over priced CD.
__label__2 EXCELLENT: I have been a cycling instructor for three years and have enjoyed learning the different techniques from different companies. This book has just endless ideas and programs to use in my classes. I especially enjoyed the section called "Cycle Sculpt" which is using the Kis Kory Bike Band with the bike. I've been using the concepts with my private clients. They just love it! Since I work at home I enjoy all the ideas to use on my stationary bike too. I never relazied there could be so much diversity on a stationary bike.
__label__2 Great nostalgic read!: Read this many years ago as a teenager and enjoyed the read again. A different world and a different mindset - reminds me of my grandmother who gave these books to us to read!
__label__2 Andy is Watching You: I was excited when this came out and wasn't dissapointed. It's not in the same league as "Everybody Hates You", mostly because I don't think CombiChrist will ever top the songs "God Bless", "Happy Fcuking Birthday", and "This Is My Rifle". That being said, this album is very tongue in cheek and still full of awesome sound. It kinda makes you want to crush something just because you can. andy has no illusions about being anything other than what he is, 1/3 of the most crushing EBM band in recent history.
__label__1 Only kept time for a short time: This kept time for about a year, and now the second hand just spins madly around as it advances through the hours trying to find the correct time. Except that when it does get to the correct time, it just keeps on going. If you wanted a clock for fast-motion time, like each minute takes just 4 seconds to happen, then this is the clock for you.
__label__2 ROCK IS BACK!: This is simply the best record I've heard in a long time. Hard rock great melodies and great songs. Saw this band live a few weeks ago they were AMAZING. Never heard of Buckcherry but Josh Todd puts the ROCK back in ROCK AND ROLL! Buy this CD and turn it up! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 The only mystery here is how did this book get good reviews?: I've been an avid fan of Mary Higgins Clark since I was a teenager and in the last 4 years or so her books have gone from well written mysteries to a sort of just cranking out another formulaic story for her legions of readers. In "Before I Say Goodbye" there is no real psychic mystery, no real sense of connection with her one dimensional characters, and certainly no real sense of menace that used to pervade Mary Higgins Clark's books. Instead it just seemed like she was going through the motions and taking the easiest and the least challenging way out. Why did I bother finishing the book? Why did I even buy this one after disliking her last 4? Sentimental feelings I guess. I have to confess that Clark managed to redeem herself from page 256 til the end. In those 18 pages I read what I have expected from MHC all along, well written suspense. Maybe there's hope after all.
__label__1 Zodiac Unmasked: Although mainly a re-hash of information [already available elsewhere], "Zodiac Unmasked" is still a must-have for true Zodiac buffs. All others need not buy.Bottom line: if you're interested in the Zodiac case and want a book on the subject, start with Graysmith's "Zodiac". Want the real facts and latest info on the case? Use the Internet.
__label__2 Awsome: I think this toy came out very well. It's way better than the old Hoth Luke and is very durable. Plus it connects to the Ultra Wampa to remake the old ice cave seen.
__label__1 Cast a Giant Shadow - could not play: I did not look closely enough at the product description to see the DVD was in PAL format and would not play on my US DVD player. Product description should have had a much more prominent description / alert the DVD was not in US format.Could not play the movie. Cannot comment on content.
__label__2 If you like parelli, you'll love this!!!: I am finding this book very helpful. I love to learn new things about horses, and dealing with them, and anything that will help improve my relationship. And this book is giving me something new an positive on every page. Even after my 14 years of dealing with them!!!
__label__1 Girls gone lame: In a nutshell, this one sucked. Not even sexy like past ones of girl/girl or solo action. Basically they just showed facial closeups of the girls doing their thing or them moaning. Boring!
__label__1 low quality: ordered 12 of the madagascar beans most of them where rancid upon arrival seem to be fermented very low quality
__label__1 Interesting trivia undercut by highly incompetant humor: This book presents a lot of interesting, even entertaining facts and trivia anecdotes, which, by themselves, would be entertaining and enjoyable, but I'm forced to agree with other Amazon customer reviews: the "witty" comments by Stan Lee are insufferably lame, even angering at times. By the time I was halfway through the book, I wish I'd had someone black out Stan Lee's punishingly unfunny, obnoxious commentary with a marker. Also, those familiar with desktop publishing will take exception to the lame, cookie-cutter, public domain computer graphics that pepper every page like discarded, randomly arranged confetti. Be warned: the book's humor value is severely comprimised by the fact that it's downright shoddy and unfunny.
__label__2 Worth Buying: Great film. Not sure how to categorize it, kind of a merge between action adventure and romantic comedy. Chemistry between Roberts and Owen was absorbing without being gratuitously sexual. Story line was good. Portrayal of CEOs, Giamatti and Wilkinson was hilarious. Carrie Preston was brilliant.
__label__1 GAME BOARD: VERY DISSAPOINTED THE STRUTURE OF THIS GAME IS GARBAGEAND WILL PROBABLY NEVER USE IT. YOU NEED TO DISCRIBE THE GAME BETTER IF I COULD RETURN IT I WOULD.
__label__2 Nice introduction to nonlinear physics: I used this book as an introduction to non-linear dynamics. I found it easy to understand, yet at a challenging level. The treatment of the material by examples make is easy to see what is going on. The book doesn't forget the theoretical side either.
__label__2 Good: This product was listed IN Stock but came in later than the normal 3-5 days.. kinda dissapointed.. but hoping to have improved business in the future with you guys.This is a well worth it combo. I'm satisfied with the price!
__label__2 Bon Jovi bounces back on the scene with new album "Bounce".: Bon Jovi's new album is, by far, one of...if not..their best. The boys from Jersey have not forgotten their roots on this one! There's a harder edge to some of the songs, but that just makes you want to listen to them more! If you really listen to the words of the songs, there seems to be such meaning behind this album, as well. Bon Jovi has truly done a magnificent job of making music over the years, and "Bounce" is certainly not a disappointment.
__label__2 ROTS - The Best PC Adventure Game Ever: Over the past 5 years, I've been very selective with the PC adventure games I've played/purchased. My previous favorites have included Obsidian, Riven, The Black Dahlia, Grim Fandango, The Last Express, Blade Runner, and Myst. I must rate Riddle of the Sphinx well AHEAD of all of these games, for the following reasons: outstanding themes, wonderful ambience, coherent game structure, marvelous soundtrack, and the logical nature of puzzles. In sum, Riddle of the Sphinx is the best adventure game I have ever played. My suggestion is to BUY IT. If you enjoy pure adventure, this game delivers it in spades--you will not be disappointed.
__label__2 Go Rock Yourself: I only bought this for "Heroes", but it has other great songs, like "Save Me", and "Trade Yourself In". I love it!
__label__1 A so-so record, but all the material is available elsewhere.: "Tonight At Noon" is an album of leftovers-- half of it is taken from the sessions for "The Clown", half of it from the sessions for "Oh Yeah". Charles Mingus was batting consistently high during this period, and at least one piece from each of these sessions is essential in his catalog ("Tonight At Noon" and "Peggy's Blue Skylight"). The balance of the material is ok, but either a bit uninspired ("Old Blues for Walt's Torin") or lifeless ("Passions of a Woman Loved").Having stated that, the deluxe edition reissues of "The Clown" and "Oh Yeah" include all this material. I'd recommend skipping this one and going with those. My rating reflects the inconsistency of the material and the lack of reasonable value. Still, if you've got those two records, pick this up for 'Tonight' and 'Peggy', you won't regret it.
__label__1 Ridiculous!!!!!: I purchased a common ordinary stainless steel napkin holder for 5.99 at Walmart to accomplish this task. You put the filters in arc side down, between the two horizontal braces that hold the sides apart.You could hang it if you wanted. It is actually easier to remove one filter this way.
__label__2 ANGELUIS: GREAT READING, INFORMATIVE, AND FLUENT AUTOBIOGRAPHY. MS SHARMA GIVES US VERY DESCRIPTIVE DETAILS AND ACCOUNTS OF HER EXPERIENCES GROWING UP IN INDIA. SHE IS VERY OPEN AND STRAIGHT FORWARD, NOTHING IS HELD BACK. SHE IS NOT ASHAME OF REVEALING FACTS. NON-STOP READING.
__label__1 poor writing and boring storytelling: I had the bad idea of picking up this book for a long flight, knowing nothing about its author. It turned out to be worse than the airline food. The writing is truly awful, clumsy yet full of conceit. The plot and the characters seem lifted from things you've read somewhere else but much better realized. I confess I was quite surprised that something like this got published. That's the only real mystery about this profoundly mediocre, boring and superfluous novel.
__label__1 Too Small: First: The picture shows a leather case. Wrong. Is just like a beach bag.Nothing special.Second: Really too small. The ProCat fit inside the caseonly with Vaseline (or a miracle).Conclusion: A big deception and never,never be bought together.
__label__1 Absolutely Moronic: I couldn't agree more with the underage reviewer.I thought that this was a "can't miss" cast, but there you go.Get a bunch of great comedy actors, give them a shallow, stupid screenplay and get a director like Arau, who seems to be more worried about the colors than about the action, and this is what you get.The movie is full of all the misconceptions that people have about Mexico north of the Rio Grande: the religion, the magic, the holy prostitute.It's like those cheesy postcards that you get at tourist traps.But at the same it's pretentious and thus, harmful.Some peolpe may even think that after seeing this movie they may have learned something about Mexico or Latin America but it's quite the opposite.Of course we could forgive this if jokes at least made us smile, which doesn't ever happen.Don't waste a single penny on this movie, don't even rent it.Another lousy movie from a lousy director like Alfonso Arau.
__label__1 Also Received Broken: Just wanted to advise that I received my PV-20DF25 shortly before Christmas 2006. Although the shipping box showed no damage, the TV inside had taken a hard hit. The console was cracked and the picture tube was loose and flopping around inside. I had no return or refund problems. Hmmmm?
__label__1 Don't know why this book gets high reviews: I'm a good limit and decent NL player, winning at both regularly. I wanted to take my game to the next level and this book did not help. There are no tricks or even organized suggestions in this book. It is a bunch of chat basically about being tight. I also bought Internet texas hold'em by Matthew Hilger and that book taught me tons. In fact my NL play improved as much from that book as it did from TJ's. Overall this book is a huge disappointment. It is repetetive and full of chatter which is interesting but can't improve your game. Send me $50 and I will tell you not to play KJ and Q10 in a NL game.
__label__1 Who would even buy this!: The vocalist sounds like he's drowning, the guitarists play the same power chord over and over again disregarding any rythm, and the songs are utterly pointless. That basically summs up Mortician.
__label__1 Pretty poor: Not sure what I was expecting, but certainly not this. Some of the tips on Go are nice, though not terribly original. The tips on business, life, etc. are hardly secrets - they are repackaged cliches (at best). The best thing about the book is the mnemonic used to organize the structure. Overall, disappointing and of little interest to any one but the serous Go player (and then there are far better volumes).
__label__1 Entertaining - not easy to insert shapes: We bought this for my daughter on her first birthday. She loved the songs and sounds (my only reason for 2 stars), but since there's only two songs they got to be incredibly redundant. The toy announces the shape as it's inserted, and will sing about numbers which is educational. The worst feature is the curved exterior. It is so difficult for little hands to insert the shapes. Even as adults we had a difficult time. We ended up donating the toy, it wasn't worth the annoyance and didn't perform it's intended purpose.
__label__1 The binding falls apart.: I cannot complain about the text itself, which is proving extremely useful.Unfortunately, after using the book for about five days, the binding has completely disintegrated. I am forced to keep the paradigms I've already studied in a binder clip; as soon as I turn a page, it breaks off.Excellent review text ruined by poor materials quality.
__label__1 Half pcmover: I bought this product to move a pc with quikbooks and word products and i was not happy. It only moved over the documents not the programs like it lead me to believe.I then had to spend more time and money getting everything removed and then install all the products.Finally I then moved the documents over!!!
__label__1 Outdated: This book was writen many years ago to introduce people to the Gardnerian Tradition of Wicca - even the title of Bucklands book is misleading! This book CAN BE of use for everyone interested in the Gardnerian or Alexandrian Tradition of Wicca. If you look for "basic training" and good beginners books - look elswhere!The book is outdated and much to complicated!
__label__1 Doesn't work: I bought this to use with the Super Mario Bros WII game. It is NOT COMPATIBLE. What good is it if you can't use it with the WII games.
__label__2 Radical pictures for radical eyes: Miron Zownir's odyssé into the darker sides of humanity is extremely intrigueing. He shows us a world that we often prefer to believe does not exist. From New York and Berlin in the early eighties to the purgatory of post-communist Eastern Europe. Homeless people, drug abusers, handicapped people, transexuals, cruising homosexuals and prostitutes (and their activities) are his subject. In stark black and white photographs, with no info except date and location, he tells the story of the marginal people. The ones who don't fit in, the ones who never communicate with us normal, well fed, happy people. As the foreword claims, this is a modern Dante's inferno. But at the same time there is a compassion for Zownir's subjects, a compassion that has resulted in this great book. Radical Eye is so uncommercial, that one must believe that this is a labour of love on Zownir's part. It really makes you think.
__label__2 Kids love this: My kids will actually spend quite a bit of time on a pogo stick when they get going. The last one we had couldn't hold the weight of teenagers and would bottom out. Our sons and their friends can really bounce on is thing.
__label__1 ...: I guess older guys and girls would like this CD, but i don't think kids do ( such as me. ) I never liked BSB, but I recently heard this CD and it's not very good. There is definitely good lyrics, but if this was directed at kids, kids like to listen to fast paced stuff. ( most of them, like me. ) There are a lot of slow songs on this CD. ( I hate slow songs. ) But then there are very few that are a little faster. I think I would only recomend this to a fan of BSB, or a fan of soft rock, or something along those lines.
__label__2 Chinoiserie plate: I bought this plate for a small wall in my bedroom. The color is striking and the gold design and rim is very classy. The plate is heavy, needs a good hanger or stand, the back is black. I have it on a gold plate holder and love it!
__label__2 If wasn't already scared...: I am a second year medical student and after reading this book I'm not sure if I am encouraged or more frightened about what I am about to face in the next 5 years. I am encouraged that some one else with little confidence can survive, but I am afraid of the many daunting tasks and cases that I could meet. Ofri does a good job at expressing the efforts and troubles that an aspiring physician must face. However I think that few of us will find such entertaining stories. However embellished the stories are they make for good reading for everyone, non-medical folks will appreciate the fine story telling and people in the field will appreciate the stories and technical aspects.
__label__2 A HIGHLY USEFUL SELF-DEVELOPMENT BOOK.: Starting with a description of the basic categories of leadership skills (foundational, direction, and influence), the book provides a self-assessment instrument showing your match with an ideal profile, pointing up areas of strength and weakness. The remaining chapters describe the various skills, clustered by the basic categories. The reader should pick from the array of skills, and focus on those most important or which they want to stress in their repertoire. This is a highly useful self-development work. The book's value is entirely based on the seriousness of the reader in using it as a learning tool. Strongly recommended.
__label__1 Funny how it made it to theatres.: Most times it was painful to watch and I just wanted to get away. The jokes were not funny at all. Adam Sandler keeps telling the nanny to study, oh yeah, get out those books and study for the big test. It wasn't funny the first time, so why would it be funny the fifth time?It's very lame to see: a child drink milk from his mother, have children say stuff just for shock effect, have people fall or crash into buildings, the hot daughters, etc.The plot of the movie is family, keeping the family together,etc. You just have to trudge through very lame jokes and bad acting until you finally get to the plot. Yes, I admit, there were a few GREAT laughs though, but just a few, very few.The movie was just a weekend in the life of a bunch of long-time friends. Overall, wasn't funny or exciting or interesting, but in the end, it had a good "message" to tell its audience about appreciating what you have in life.
__label__2 Great Animals: We really like these animal magnets for our daughter, and she loves them too. The magnet covers the entire animal, so no concern with it not sticking to the fridge. Also, the pictures are more realistic instead of cartoonish. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a few of the animals are small, and we were concerned they may be a choking hazard for our 1 year old. Also, the magnets are wood with the animal picture glued to the front. If your child likes to put everything in their mouth(like ours does), or if these get wet (dropped in the dog's water bowl), then it will mess up the picture of the animal.
__label__1 Riding bullet: Stephen King writes better. I expected more from this book, unfortunately it did not reach my reading expectations. I hope next book will do it.
__label__2 hard to find: This item was extremely hard to find but it was the only gift he wanted so I am glad i found it here on Amazon.
__label__2 Great Pet Bed!: I love this pet home. I bought it for my dog to have a home in the summer (because I travel and I can't take my dog's hard crate in the car with other luggage). It fits perfectly in my Honda's seat (back or front), and it also folds nicely to store in the trunk and doesn't take up any space. My dog loves it, and I can also zip her up in it and go out to church or the store and she is safe and sound. Although I use it during traveling I also leave it up in my room now so my dog has a house in the living room and my room.
__label__1 dele menos: vaya, raza fo christ! ud. no tienen variedad en tu music. el unico canto bueno es "verdades descubiertas", los demas son algo aburridos, aunque la letra es chilero. pero da dolor de cabeza escucharlo por mucho tiempo.ud. traten demaciado duro ser como los demas, y la sena q aquel hace con su mano en the cover no tiene nada de bueno
__label__2 three-year olds dream: The structure itself is pretty good considering it will go thru a lot of wear and tear by my daughter. The windows pop out easily, but easily put back in place. My three-year old daughter loves it! She plays with it everyday and for hours at a time. The sounds it makes sound very real and is a great extra for the house. If your child likes to play with Barbies, then I suggest this as great gift. It does take up space, so make sure you consider that.
__label__2 A crazy, wonderful story that made me laugh and cry!: Jimmy Lerner is this average, middle-class, middle-aged white guy who works for the Phone Company in a corporate cubicle. And then he is suddenly in a prison, locked up with a Nazi cellmate. The way he deals with it, the humor and honesty and the horror is just incredible.One of the best books I have ever read.
__label__1 Avoid this book: I have read hundreds of technical computer books and I own many of them, so I can judge very well if a book is worthwhile. "J2EE: The Complete Reference" by Jim Keogh is the "WORST" book I have ever read. There are errors in almost every illustration and example. I expect one or two typos, but this is beyond belief. It was a total waste of my time to read and money to buy. Avoid this book and do not waste your time and money.
__label__1 Run away... fast: I have listened extensively to every single one of 311's studio albums, and this one is just below par on almost every measure. 311 used to be cocky and clever, using their creativity to blend many styles of music in a most pleasing way. This album misses the mark, and painfully. It sounds forced and overly poppy (refer to their song "Hive": 'The day we turn to pop, the show will stop'), making it really hard to listen to. There are some gems... "Waiting" and "Don't Tread on Me" are the only ones though. I do not recommend this album if you want to keep your view of 311 and their albums uninjured.
__label__1 Video had no sound: My kids were so excited to get this movie for Christmas. But when they tried it, it had no sound! Isn't there any quality control in here??
__label__1 Mixed review: There are 3-4 variations on the W96H design. Great looking watch with all the functions I wanted. But the deal killer is the watch band. It is held in by screws and cannot be replaced by a generic watch band. You have to buy genuine Casio and it was $15 at eBay. So more cost effective to get a new W96H type watch. My watch band failed after 10 months while most Casios I have owned take 2-3 years for that to breakSo on to a new model. Just bought the W-800H-1AV which also has a 10 year battery but will take a generic replacement watch band so that when it fails I'll get a Velcro wrap around for it.First digital I ever bought was Casio 25 years ago.Then eight years ago I tried Timex Iron man and Expedition. I use diff functions a lot and doing this runs down the batteries quickly on these. Plus illumination takes too much juice. So now it is back to Casio and 10 year batteries. Just have to buy the right one
__label__1 So poorly written that I couldn't read it.: A friend tried listening to this on tape, and she couldn't listen to it.It's a failure in two media.
__label__2 Earth shocking: I was probably 8-years old or so when I saw Earthshock for the first time and it immediately became one of my all time favorite episodes of Doctor Who. Cybermen, death, intrigue, this episode has it all. And 30 years later, it still stand up (besides the cheesy graphics). These are the Cybermen, not the robots created in the RTD era.
__label__2 Good game: If your little one likes Clifford then they'll like this game. My son is only 2 and a half and he gets a kick out of it.
__label__1 Amazon--Lousy Product Description: Hard to find in the description that is a YOUTH size large. So you might want to make sure you're ordering an adult shirt, not this children's shirt. Even the picture is misleading. An adult in the same shirt, with a young boy fishing? The focus is on the adult! Amazon, get it together. This was a waste of money, and I'm not going to waste an hour of my life waiting in the post office to mail this back.
__label__2 quick and not too easy: I feel like I get a good workout in a few minutes by doing the circuit training. I do these in the morning before getting ready for work. I really feel that I'm getting a good workout in less than 15 min vs my routine workout 30-50min. Great for those days you just don't have enough time to workout.
__label__2 Great Cheat Sheet: This two-sided laminated cheat sheet includes all the information needed to make adjustments/changes on the fly. Its small size (Tri-folded 8 1/2 x 11 sheet) easily fit into my camera bag. With all the information provided, print size is small but clearly legible and includes everything important from the manual.
__label__1 Terrible Interpretation of the Story: I agree that actors and actresses were good, however, they way the story was interpreted is way off the original idea of the book. If you like this book, don't watch this movie, it will drive you nuts when you saw Valjean beat up the bishop when stealing the lamp; you will be upset to find out Marius turns out a street rat; and many many more. I would suggest you to find the French version of this novel, both the old version (which is the best) and the Jean-Paul Belmondo's new "Les Miserable": I would rate the former 5 stars and later 4.5 stars.The later one use World War II France as the background of the story to demonstrate the universal truth of Hugo's "Les Miserable". You won't regret by watching it.
__label__2 a reveiw of a very good book: This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend it to anybody who likes a good adventure book about dogs. The book is awsome!
__label__1 very limited use: This item can only be used on hard surfaces. I feel it is a waste of money to spend on such a limited use item. A good gas blower can do so much more with only one item to store. by the way what type of point was the jerk supposed to be making in his review? It didnt't even make sense!!! It gave no information except to show he was the jerk.
__label__2 Entertaining!: Always can count on a good (love) story from this author! Her books usually have happy endings with lots of romatic twists.
__label__2 Great history of parks beginnings: Totally satisfied with dvd's. We love the history of how the parks came to be. Even includes old reel to reel and photo's. Takes you back in time before it all came to be. T.Mccall
__label__1 Cancelled order: I didn't order these. Computer glitch. Don't want them because I didn't order them. Will not pay for them.! Nope
__label__2 Wow, wow, and wow.: Been practicing Buddhism for years, and this is one of the best tools for meditation I've ever seen. Practical, accessible, and beneficial for anyone.
__label__1 Do not buy a Farouk Iron: I had the same experience as another user. The iron worked for 4 months and died. I sent the iron back to Farouk and they would not warranty it because purchased from an authorized dealer. What a dog turd! Don't buy this.
__label__1 Broken: This toy was a gift for my 3 y.o. son. The line became tangled inside the fishing pole handle within one hour of use. I tried to unscrew and open the handle but it is assembled in a way that I cannot reach the line with my hands. I'm really disappointed. This was the gift my son was most excited about.
__label__1 Complete Goof!: These headphones, despite the miraculous reviews on here, don't even work with my TV! They're incompatible with the newer TV's, which don't offer RCA Audio Output anymore. These headphones are old school, and will not work on the newer model TVs. Complete waste of time & effort for me ordering these headphones. I wouldn't have liked them anyway, had my TV been compatible. Not worth the $64 price tag. They probably cost $4 to manufacture.
__label__1 Almost laughable......: I don't remember why I got these, but what I DO know, is that they can't cut through pine, (not without falling out of the handle), and definitely can't touch a hard wood like oak. I'd say I had success using them on a pumpkin around Halloween, but at the moment looking at them in the trash, I can't honestly say that they did that very well either......
__label__1 Least Favorite Kaufman Film: I really liked Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind & Being John Malkovich. Synecdoce has an interesting plot and a few fun moments, but it is not an "enjoyable" film. It's main character has many, many problems and spends years working on the same project. I felt that the same philosophical point was being made over & over, which was probably intended, but which started to bore me. However, if you can stick with it, the ending is satisfying in a melancholic sort of way.
__label__1 worthless: will not work with verizon wireless.Mobile Phone Toolswould have been nice to know this before buying
__label__2 Great resource for speakers: I've read a lot of books on public speaking. This is definitely one of my favorites. Doug sprinkles the helpful tips with lots of personal anecdotes that add humor and drive home the message.
__label__2 Gritty, Spellbinding Melodrama Set in Slums of Old N.Y.: I am not sure how much research went into this project or how realistic it is. I am sure the result is hugely entertaining.Great sets, costumes and,overall, persuasive acting. I agree with the comment that the writing could be sharper and Corky's Irish accent is a little off, but Copper's head on confrontation with the harsh, often desperate, poverty endured by the immigrants, and characters who are flawed, complex people who feel real, pulled me in. I didn't feel the plot was unfocused--I particularly like the abrupt transitions from violence to tenderness and vice versa. And the mystery of Corky's lost family helped tie in several subplots, including an abortionist's murder and a child prostitute's precocious love for Corky.Overall, I give this a big recommend. Every episode unveiled (sometimes unnerving) surprises, and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.
__label__2 excellent and quick: the product is working great, it reached me within the time limits and the product was in confirmity with the description provided on the site.
__label__2 Dean Martin at his best!: Here is Dean before he became a parody of himself and stopped caring. Dean Martin was essentially a crooner and his voice works best when he is lazily singing through a song in his perfectly relaxed baritone. This is a voice that sounds like a beloved uncle who just began to sing after dinner and a few drinks to his wife in a small italian restaurant. Yes, it sounds that unplanned and unpolished but perfectly charming. A great cd for a romantic evening or just relaxing.
__label__1 Emerson review: I purchased this item on 1/14 and 1 month later it is not working properly. The CD player skips and the sound becomes unrecognizable. The unit was not mishandled, dropped, or abused but merely sat on a kitchen counter during the entire period so in my opinion it should still be working. Looks like I am out $30.
__label__1 the lowest of the low: i watch TV a good deal and the so called music that comes blasting or drooling out on commercials makes me pull what little hair out that i have left. this song 'Here comes the sun again' really is the worst so far. i don't particularly like opera singers and i loathe pop/rock music, but somewhere there has got be someone who doesn't conjure up a vision of a stoned out, unshaven, unshowered, subzero intelligent, speech and grammar challenged moron when he is opening his mouth to sing. Singers' diction, grammar, sound production has become so loopy-i can't understand why someone would get in front of a microphone and yodel, lisp, slurp, distort, and worst of all, just plain be out of tune. This guy drives me nuts.
__label__2 a funny look at disaster movies: this spoof of the disaster movies is very funny but a little slow in spots.it's the first run of mankinds greatest leap foward,the launch of the cyclops,the first atomic powered BUS????????and people want it to fail! very much like airplane(years before it) but a few to many misses to get 5 stars. still a lot of silly goofy fun,give it a try
__label__1 Annoying: My Win7 64-bit computer doesn't recognize this device on start-up. I have to wait until the computer boots, disconnect it from the USB port and reconnect it, and then it will work. I did upgrade to the Win 7 drivers. I also had intermittent issues of it working/not working when I ran it on another Win XP machine. Seems fairly reliable with Win7 other than the start-up problem.The writing on the IN and OUT cables is practically unreadable, so you just about have to guess which is which.
__label__2 Great Machine: We've been using this thing for months not one problem so far. 6-8 minutes and you have a gallon of the best drinks ever, going to buy another for Non alcoholic drinks for the kids.
__label__2 A dapper little man--But don't remove the parts!: I purchased this dapper little action figure for my good friend, who is also an English teacher. She LOVES it. She carried it around with her during final exams and had Charles shake hands with her students.A caution, however: don't remove the removable parts. She took that hat off almost immediately--and it doesn't stay on after you take it off. Also, the quill broke off, as well (probably because he was shaking hands) but now it looks like a cigarette.Other than that, it's a fun, silly little thing perfect for your literary friends.Accoutrements: I think you should make an Emily Dickinson action figure. Thanks! :)
__label__2 Brilliant!: This comedy is brilliant! It seems to get funnier the more I watch it. It will go down in comedy history as one of the great ones.
__label__2 Happy Customer & Friend: I bought this book for my friend for Christmas who loves Britain. She was overjoyed to recieve it. Contains many British idioms and words that are different from American English. Buy for yourself or anyone else that is a British enthusiast.
__label__2 Excelent introduction and companion text: This text was a great asset coming out of high-school level maths and entering into college-level calculus. It covers necessary previous topics briefly and efficiently, providing an excellent reference in case you forget something or skipped it in your previous studies. The examples are useful and to the point; sections are brief and incredibly effective. This book has a more complete overview of algebra, trig, and calculus than my entire high-school education. It's very easy to look up a subject and quickly understand it, which is essential when working through multi-faceted problems later. There are several problems in the text which have inaccurate solutions, but that's fairly minor for the vast resource this book has been to me. This was my father's A-level book (in England) and I'm proud to say that it's now finding use once again.Most college texts are $200. For $1? Buy it! I can't recommend it enough.
__label__1 Worst Coffee Pot EVER: We decided to splurge on a more expensive coffee machine with the previous one died. We thought the carafe was a nice feature to keep the coffee warm on the weekends as we drink it slower. What a waste of money! I am going back to our $15 sale special coffee maker. Worked okay for about two months, though it was "tempermental" sometimes and we would find water overflowing on the counter. Last night I walk into the kitchen to find it spewing coffee grounds and hot water all over the counter and floor! I tried "working with it" a couple times, but it is done. I cannot get it to work right this morning. WHAT A WASTE! I will say the carafe kept the coffee hot for several hours though. Too bad.
__label__2 Devils Advocate!!!: Elvis never recorded "DID I SAY THAT?I know everything there is to know about Elvisand he didn't record this song... Yes it sure sounds like Elvis in the interview. I did some research but I can't find any reference to him saying what he says on this single. So they really must have found a lost interview... ( I checked the book ELVIS word for word and the Definitive Elvis DVD collection)Looks to me like the song was written as a very witty response to the interview and to continue to promote Elvis to the Youth markets. Clever, I like the song alot. But it ain't Elvis..It is good though. prove me wrong!THE EXPERT HAS SPOKEN!
__label__2 You can stretch.: The biggest problem I always had with all the stretch tapes I tried before is that none of them let you stretch long enough to get real benefit of stretching. Everbody seemed so busy to move onto the next position. It sometimes made me even wonder if those advanced exercisers really could stretch muscles in 3 seconds. But I COULD stretch and feel it with this tape. Every stretch is about 20-30 seconds long and this makes you feel really refreshed after done as well as you can learn which part of your body is better or worse. The other thing I love about this tape is that it is very easy to do. Karen doesn't frustrate me with unattainable range of motion or positions. Her cueing is excellent, her comments on how you should visualize or feel when doing certain stretches are very very helpful. I hope she will make another tape like this soon.
__label__2 As a lovr of most things French...: I loved this book. As a Southerner and a Francophile, I was endeared by her American spirit mixed with all things French. While living among the quirky yet lovable French for a season of her life, we are allowed an intimaite window to her life. I was intrigued by her beautiful relationship with native French and ex-patriots. Their experience is to be envied, and I lived vicariously through her wonderful account of her family life through "La Belle France." Brava, I cannot wait until she writes again.
__label__1 Disappointment: This is my 3rd DVD player. I've never seen one this poorly made. This Panasonic changer has annoying motor noises when reading low number chapters. Its a design problem. Don't waste your time and money. Don't Buy This PIECE OF [JUNK]!
__label__1 Printer breaks -way- too easily after barely a month: Bought this item and tried it. First couple of CDs print just fine, as expected... However, after a few weeks of standby mode, I tried again. The printer gets stuck with an incomplete print, and any attempt to move the head ruins the printed CD, and makes any other prints impossible. Best to avoid using this, it's not worth the money.
__label__1 Uncomfortable: I bought this air mattress for various usage. I liked the idea of a raised air mattress. Unfortunately there are two things that make this air mattress a bad one. The first is the built in "pillow". It's simply uncomfortable and unusable. Put your head on your pillow and look at the shape. It's like a valley between two hills. With this air mattress, the built in pillow is inflated to the max and is not soft but very firm. If you add your own pillow then your head is too high compared to the rest of the body. You'll wake up with neck pain.The second thing is that the rest of this air mattress is made of canals or straight "tubes". Remember that the mattress will be inflated until it's firm. If it's not firm then there is no support. I had to add a 2 inch memory foam topper to make it a little bit more comfortable but I can still feel the "canals". Definitely not something I will recommend to anyone.
__label__2 The funniest movie I have EVER seen!: This is a wonderful horror/comedy movie! It's strange plot twist of ancient legends makes it even better.
__label__1 drawings of the author missing: I was very disappointed to find the images missing. The book is incomplete without the funny drawings of Jean Webster.
__label__1 Misleading: This Bible is only 3 books, and is very difficult to transition through. It would be great if a woman's Bible contained all the books, and offered a devotional.
__label__1 doesn't stay on: Solid audio quality but these do not stay on (slip during jogging). I was disappointed but I guess I just didn't get lucky in terms of finding the perfect headphones for me. They could be perfect for someone I guess (the ones with ears that they can stay on).
__label__1 Drops traffic on both WAN interfaces when reconfiguring.: I had high hopes for the FVX538, a relatively cheap router with failover support! After several months of trying to make it work (upgrading firmware, reading the manual, etc) I ended up going with pfSense on a rackmount server.My main issue with the FVX538 is that it would drop all traffic going over both WAN interfaces for about a minute, even when making seemingly trivial changes like updating DNS.
__label__1 Decent movie, but nothing orginal.: I hate when movies start off by pretty much giving away the ending. If you are have a real good eye for movies you can alreayd pick out then ending by the actions in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Once that happened, I wasn't really interested. Edward Burnz just is so wooden to me and uninteresting. I just couldn't get behind his character. Rachel Weiz looked beautiful as always, but they really gave her nothing to do. Watching her seduce the VP of the Bank was a fun.This movie is real predictable. I watched it with a friend who never really into movies like I am, and she figured everything out from the first five minutes. Now that is bad.Dustin Hoffman was great in his role and he seemed to be having fun playing the big and bad. Should have been more scenes with him.
__label__1 I Rather Roll Over and Die: The movie is horrible. The movie takes moments from the book and puts them out of order. Events that happended at the beginning of the book were put at the ending in the movie. The movie also leaves out important details from the book that should have been used to describe events in the movie. Without those details the event makes no sense what-so-ever to someone who has not read the book. In summary, read the book and forget the movie.
__label__2 A fun read: This book is really a fun read. If you like baseball, it has enough baseball to keep you interested. If you don't like baseball, you'll still enjoy it. Hanson is a really fine writer and the story is funny and moving.
__label__1 Very Inaccurate: This device is so inaccurate that it's not only out of the ballpark, it's not even in the same county.We have one of these at our fitness center where I work and it is consistently WAY off. According to a professional-grade scanner (InBody 230) and (and confirmed with caliper testing), my body fat percentage is 10-10.5%. The Omron HBF-306 monitor most recently reported my body fat % as 17.3. That's an absolute error of at least 6.8% and a relative error of at least 64%. With that kind of inaccuracy, what's the point?The price makes it appealing, but for the same price, you're better off getting a quality caliper and tape measure set. Not as convenient, but far more accurate.
__label__2 Original: I like their style. Big Boi's fast-paced rhymes is excellent and its got a groove to it. The beats are original and bumping. Good tracks: Da Art of Storytelling part 2. Return of The G. Chonkyfire. Half of the tracks are so-so, thats why it gets only 4 star.
__label__2 Nice Tricycle: We bought this trike for my grandson's second birthday. He has a chopper ride-on toy, but he can't reach the pedals. The trike comes set on the closest setting to enable reaching the pedals. He can reach them easily.The toy comes assembled, which is very nice, and it folds up easily for transportation between our house and his. He loves the little basket in the back of the bike.He is still learning how to work the pedals so I would suggest buying a push pole for parents.
__label__2 Your Sacred Needs for good music: If you've heard Richard McGraw in a downtown folkbar, it's not just because he's a growing cult favorite on the New York singer/songwriter scene. You heard him because the audience listened. They actually went to hear the lyrics! His guitar, spare and clean and forceful, and his singing, ardent about sex and graced with loopy logic about love, will make you want to buy this CD and enjoy it over and over again. I did.
__label__1 For Sensitive Skin??? Not mine.: I have very sensitive skin which includes perfume. This has perfume, although in the german spelling of parfum. It is too much for my skin, I need fragrance free. So I had to send all of the items of sebamed that I ordered. I did find a great alternative that is fragrance free which is the Earth Science Clarifying face wash, and their fragrance free moisturizer, and their Apricot Nite cream. Amazon does carry these, but the Earth Science website gives you free shipping on orders of $25 or more.
__label__2 AWESOME!!!: I love this cd! at first listen I liked it fairly well, but now it is one of my favorite cds, and I just cannot take it out of my cd player. Hawthorne Heights deals with heartbreak, and anyone who can relate will love this cd.my favorite songs are "who We are," "Language Lessons," "Dead In The Water" and "where Can I Stab Myself In the Ears." All the other songs are great too. The only song that I didn't really care for was "decembers." It was just okay.I recommend this album to anyone who loves emo/screamo music or has a broken heart. And to everyone who says Hawthorne Heights sucks, go phunk yourselves, because that just means that you have no appreciation for good music.Anyway, go buy this cd, cause it rocks! (oh, and cd version A is exactly the same, except that it has a different cover on it. This one has the girl, that one has the guy.)
__label__2 great read: really good book to read if you want to learn about communicating and how to keep your relationship going on.
__label__1 Sloppy Stuff- Not For Beginners: I'm new to Premiere so I thought this book looks rather promising.I have to admit I haven't read the whole book. I'm still stuck at chapter 1 ('Premiere Quickstart'), and that's because the steps given are not entirely in sequence, some important labels in the diagram are missing (where's the thread area you're talking about?), and things work out differently than described.In summary, this book (at least the first chapter) is a sloppy piece of work. Don't touch it if you're a beginner.
__label__2 Avengers Assemble!: Epic! Totally worth it and excellent in 3D. I was actually surprised by the 3D quality, it was just as good as what I remember in the theater.Definitely worth the money! I must have.
__label__2 Stretching for Seniors: I received the used video in exactly the condition in which it was reported to be. It worked well and arrived in good tome. I am pleased with this purchase. These stretches are exactly what I needed.
__label__1 Entirely derivative, uninspired drivel: For those whose minds operate on only 2 cylinders and who like to hear music without a flare of originality or creativity, marked by such inspired titles as 'Bubble Toes', the album of your dreams has arrived. If you took good music and removed all its best characteristics, this album is the end result. I even prefer elevator music over this album- at least elevator music often reminds you of the good arrangements or melodies that it came from.
__label__1 Okay, But Only Lasted 1 Week.: I bought this wheel for 80 dollars at Circuit City, and to tell the truth it was a waste of my money. It is very bulky and it barely fit on my desk, and the racing just isn't realistic in my opinion. After one week (I took very good care of it) it just broke, stopped working. I reccomend you spend your money on something else.
__label__2 A timeless time capsule: Car Wash is one of the best examples of the inner city African-American experience ever. Films like Car Wash, Shaft,Sparkle and others in this genre may be the only surviving document of the way we lived in those days. It is witty, gritty, and downright pretty. The soundtrack is also a classic. The band Rose Royce was assembled (much like the Monkees and the Commitments) just for the film. The soundtrack was a hit before the movie was even released. Car Wash is definitely a winner.
__label__1 ink drinker: I waited for 5 months to buy this printer after I was told at Comp USA that this was the state of the art printer. WRONG. This printer drinks ink and costs hundreds to keep running. I had a paper feed problem which no one at Canon either understood of cared to involve themselves with. So my $99 Epson does most of my printing. I have also found it difficult to calibrate with my Mac so a lot of ink is wasted getting the color right. Too much money for too little.
__label__1 ALERT--Very Poor Quality and Support: I bought the JVC DVD player and it worked for 3 months. After that the image started freezing. When I took it to the JVC service center they wanted to charge me $50.00 just to look at it even though it was still under warranty. I called JVC support and someone there told me that the model I had wasn't a JVC DVD player. I still have the box and the player clearly says JVC. I must say that the person with whom I talked to could hardly understand English. Result? I just trashed this DVD player and bought a DVD player from another brand.
__label__1 if he didn't have a gun....how did he shoot himself?: If this is not THE most over rated CD ever, then it is certainly a contender for the title. If it wasn't for Cobain's suicide, no one would care about Nirvana today. But, just like Jim Morrison has kept the Doors on the "cult following" list, Cobain's death will keep everyone wanna-be emo child wistful of shooting themselves.As for the music, I could only say that shooting yourself doesn't make someone a "great writer" or a "great musician" and Nirvana proves this though and though. On this particular CD, Cobain mumbles his way though at least 1/3 of the lyrics while making absolutely no sense during the other 2/3 that are intelligible. In one particular song he outright lies when he sings the lyrics "no, I don't have a gun"...and I think we all know now that he in fact did have a gun.
__label__1 please go...: Ok so PLEASE STAY may not have been the best choice for a single. Get this cd if only for the video extra. Do not get it for the remixes. Oh Kylie, great dance diva, remix vamp extraordinaire. What happened? The remixes are horrible!!! Probably the worst I've heard in a long time, and for Kylie that's rare. She's known for having some of the best remixes. If anything get cd1 for the non-lp tracks and the nifty calendar.
__label__2 Any Rhee Yoga DVD is good: Have bough 5 or 6 of his DVD's and highly recommend them all. I particularly like the deliberateness of his approach that maximizes use of the core muscle groups and minimizes the possibility of injury. Buy it today!
__label__2 Simply the Best: One of the best movies I have ever seen. Even if you guess some of the surprises during the film, keep watching. You won't guess everything. I thought I had it figured out, but continued to be very surprised, all the way up until the shocking ending! Then I immediately wanted to see it again. I'm not a huge fan of Christian Bale offscreen, but I have to give it to him; he does whatever it takes to bring his characters to life. He is a great actor and really goes the extra mile for his audience. The entire cast does a wonderful job with this one. No complaints. And that's not something I say about a movie very often.
__label__2 BLOODFLOWERS sounds just like heaven: After the radio-readiness of WISH and WILD MOOD SWINGS it is nice to see this band get back to its roots. BLOODFLOWERS surely blooms... I will be going to see The Cure in concert this June and I can't wait to see -and hear- how these songs will transfer live. This is by far their best work since DISINTERGRATION. Like many of the other customer reviewers have noted, if this is their final work it is an excellent way to go...
__label__2 Loved the Bride and Prejudice CD: My favorite song was #1 the Panjabi wedding song. I play it over and over. The reast of the CD I also good. I would recomend this CD to those who loved the movie.
__label__2 Uncovers the secret vast rightwing conspiracy !: You want to know why Clinton got impeached over a personal matter while Bush and GOP are getting a free ride even while it's obvious that they are indeed guilty as sin for dragging this country into a nazi-like war in Iraq resulting in oil for blood and in the process killing thousands of US troops and hundred thousands Iraqis? Then read this book and defeat the TALIBAN RIGHTWING MEDIA !!! And yes, we need to purge the centrist Democrats and put real Democrats in their place to WIN !!!
__label__1 Horrible software: It took me 15 minutes to install Microsoft NET ...(luckily I'm an experienced computer user), half an hour to enable its macros in vain, and half an hour trying to close it. Finally I had to resort to Windows Task Manager to kill the program. What a nightmare!
__label__2 My favorite pilates tape: This is one of my favorite workouts. It's a lot faster paced than a lot of pilates videos--so, if you are familiar with the positions, you won't be spending half your time lying on your back waiting for things to be explained in detail. I usually concetrate on one thing (cardio, abs, legs, etc) everyday, but I still like to add some pilates to each day, so this tape is perfect. It's divided by 4 nice, neat little stopping places, and each section focuses on a specific part.
__label__2 History at its best: History comes alive with Sitchin. He ably demonstrates that the stone tablets being dug up in the Middle East are more truth than myth.
__label__2 Cute piggy bank for my niece: She needed her first piggy bank, and after looking everywhere for it, I settled on this one. It is very cute, and perfect for a little girl. The packaging is adorable as well, and there is no need to wrap it.
__label__2 Better than I Thought: I had heard some bad reviews about this movie before I brought it, but I got it anyway because not everyone has the same taste. I must say that I am not disappointed with this movie. It's soo creepy and scary. The fact that it's based on true events just adds to the creepiness of it. Overall I think that it was a good movie and I'm glad that I brought it.
__label__2 keeps air in good: I use this every summer, while I am fighting forest fires,, it is comphy ,fills quickly, and holds the air. all night.. The only neg. is that the pump is very noisy. so be carefull, setting up, late at night
__label__1 Barely Evokes the theatrical mastery of its namesake.: I saw this video a few weeks ago and I was astonished. Of course, being a fan of the musical, I should have realized that THE FANTASTICKS is not a property suited to film adaptation. Everything charming and adorable about the Off-Broadway show--that still charms after so many years--has been pushed to the side so that the directors "concept"--oh so reminiscent of ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN ARE DEAD--may take centerstage. The power of the stage show comes from the actors talking to the audience and inviting the audience into their own little world. On film, that world is thrown at us muddled and uninteresting. And the characters are reconceived! Oh, the horror. Trust me, if you are a fan of the stage show, do not waste your time here. If you have never seen the show and wish to be initiated, it is a toss-up, I guess, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone with taste.
__label__1 what an angry book......: i hope that Peggy Robin feels better about herself after writing this book; i have never seen so much anger displayed by an author. perhaps with the money she makes from this book, she could invest in some therapy? she certainly does not sound as if she's over her guilt. i'm not sure how directing that anger towards successfully breastfeeding mothers can help her. this book was very distressing to read. i hope that not all mothers who chose artificial baby milk over breastmilk are this angry and resentful. you can add me to her list of Militant Breastfeeding Cultmembers, i guess? very sad....very very sad woman. i pray that therapy can help her.
__label__1 quit working: My 8 year old daughter got this for her birthday. She thought it was great, THEN, it stopped working after 1 hour!!! I had in brand new batteries.....The control seemed to be the problem. The lights would come on when I tried to turn it, but the other knob wouldn't let the scooter move. Very frustrating for my daughter......she was almost in tears and threw the control down.
__label__2 Phenominal Romance with accurate History: This is by far the best read around. Of the many texts and books one has available if you've any interest at all in the eastern culture, romance, chivalry, chance and justice - this is for you. While this is my third reading, it is as the first. The clear pictures of the country, the smells of food from the bazzar and the emotions of the characters, all are vividly portrayed for the reader to escape into. I suggest reading the book before seeing the 1984 for tv release movie - DVD is not as good and has been cut in several spots.
__label__2 Informative, for idiots and non-idiots, alike: As a somewhat lapsed Catholic, this book had me laughing, thinking, praying and going to confession. I now attend Mass regularly, thanks to Bob O'Gorman's and Mary Faulker's page turner manuscript. I can accurately debate my Protestant friends and, as a convert, I am better informed about the Church than most cradle Catholics. This book compares the Vatican's official position on various issues with those of Catholics, themselves. I found it a breath of fresh air as opposed to more serious, "preachy" books. The knowledge I gained has given me a new appreciation of my faith. Even my parish priest enjoyed it so much, he has yet to return the copy I loaned him.
__label__1 The subject is appealing but the plot poorly executed.: Although the reader can sympathize with Benny's learning disability, the other characters are disappointing and unrealistic. The father too cruel, the mother too weak, the sister too mean and his teachers oblivious. The fact that they haven't understood that he has a learning disability until fifth grade is appaling. Then, suddenly, the coach intervenes and everyone's personality changes overnight. Most of all, there is too much dialog between the adults in the story and not enough action centered around Benny.
__label__2 TWISTED SISTER'S BEST: Twisted sister's best album. I grew up watching them in the bars in the NY Tri-State area. They were clearly the best bar band of the late 70's and 80's. This album is a culmination of all their hard work. You won't be disappointed!
__label__2 Mare's Leg: Watching the episodes brings back great, childhood memories. Steve McQueen did an excellent protraying a bounty hunter with a conscience.
__label__2 Hysterical: I am relieved that I did not let the silly title dissuade me from reading this book. I just finished MaCallister's Aisling Dragon Series and thoroughly enjoyed it so I thought that I would try one of her vampire books.I cannot wait to read more of her vampire genre ~ especially if they end up being as funny and exciting as this one.
__label__1 Horrible quality!: We are on our third Badger in 5 years. They last at best 2 years then fall completely apart. The housing just cracks. I do not recommend this product at all.
__label__1 pricing: I have a brush just like this one that I really like but it only cost $5.00. $120?! - is that a mistake?
__label__2 Quirky, interesting, helpful: Bev Walton-Porter's Sun Signs for writers is an amazing resource for writers, both new to the craft, and more established, giving both perspective on our own 'sun sign' based writing talents and quirks, and giving a solid base to refer to for characterization.Though generalized and possibly 'generic' in places, this only served to reinforce and highlight where writers are both the same, and dissimilar - which, again feeds back into producing believable characters and authentic voice.And its the voice that's most important - with an authoritative voice, this book teaches you to embrace, and find your own style, and verve. A highly enjoyable read and a must have reference for any writer.
__label__1 Bad Joke!: I believed I was ordering a small book of One Up on Wall Street but it is not the same book ...only same name and cover. Only contains key phrases...got burned and because it was only a few dollars with shipping didn't want to waste any time and more$ to send back...Don'ty be fooled!
__label__2 cool movie ,but the books are better: I saw this movie a while ago and recently bought a copy ,only to once again watch it now.Afterward ,I thought to myself,"the books are a whole lot better".Don't get me wrong ,the movie is pretty cool ,but that's about it ,because in the books ,you got to see a whole lot of stories develope one from the other.The movie was just a short sum of some of those stories.It's a well told story(in the movie)but things are kinda slowed down and then rushed near the end, kinda leaving you thinking it would be nice to see a series of this story.The movie does no justice to the books ,but visually ,it was totally cool to see one of my favorite characters in motion.Over-all ,the story was cool ,but at the same time, a let-down ,just waiting to be told some more instead of ending.
__label__2 Not what I was looking for: I'm sure these earphones work and sound fine but I was looking for something softer/smaller for my apparently small earholes. :)
__label__1 as biased a book as a Christian could wish for.: If you want to live in a sealed Christian world this book will leave you soothed and intact. Your views will not be challenged and you can bask in the reassurance that the only opinions worth having are Christian ones. This is a deeply biased and intellectually impoverished book. His pronouncements on the scientific world view were cringe-making. It was laughable to find him cribbing from other "introduction to philosophy" books like Will Durant's work, as the foundation for his own introductory book. Such is the shallowness of Sproul's scholarship... a first year undergraduate could have done better research.This book willl be of no use to any one serious about studying philosophy. At best it might serve as an intro reader in conservative Christian high schools.
__label__2 Excellent!: This is a great quiver for an even better price! It hangs pretty well off a belt or waistband, and holds plenty of arrows. (The most I've carried is ten, but it can definitely hold a lot more.) The only cons to buying this product is it came in black and not brown, but I wasn't too unhappy, because it serves its purpose well.
__label__2 I must have read a different book, I thought it was great.: Everyone is tearing this book apart. They keep comparing it to the Kay Scarpetta novels. If they would quit trying to compare it and read it for what it is they might enjoy it better. I thought it was a refreshing change and the characters were nothing but shallow. They were deep in a subtle way. I feel that she allowed us to form our own opinions first then find out who they really are. I enjoyed the book very much. I can relate to the things going on in the book. It actually made me have to think instead of just saying here this is how it is. Quit comparing apples to oranges and enjoy the book.
__label__2 Quirky: This movie is really quirky and fun. To see the character develop and deal with the real life problems was funny and entertaining.
__label__1 Flashy, but not very good at navigation..: I have this in my car, and my wife has a Garmin quest (older model ~$350). The pioneer works OK, but looses lock easier, and the database is not as up-to-date as the Garmin. I recommend carrying a phone book with you, since the database doesn't have many newer stores and locations. It also doesn't take you as close to your destination. Sometimes, it stops directing you about a half mile away. Finding stores and points of interest is difficult without the address. It does do a good job of navigating on freeways, with very nice diagrams of each intersection. It also has XM Nav-traffic as an option, and I do like how it informs me when traffic is backed up. If you really need the XM radio, and traffic, I would consider this GPS. If navigation is your primary function, you will be much happier with a garmin. The data for the pioneer is still 1.0, and the replacement data disks are $250. I can only hope the updates will be more affordable.
__label__2 Go Girl: Go Hillary! This albim is so personal and kick a$$. At times its a bit to POP for me but this is a step in the right direction. This CD has good beats & writing,so buy it already.
__label__1 Not for me: ***SPOILER***This book was not for me. The zombies aren't the traditional zombies, they are thinking, coherent ones capable of planning. I did not like that, as well as the fact that there were zombie bunnies and zombie squirrels. After that I put the book down and never picked it up again.
__label__2 Sonny's Book: He is reading this book now. He was happyto be able to purchase this.the book is in good condition
__label__1 It turned my skin red like a sun burn!!: I tried using this 3 times and shortly after my 3rd time, my face turned red like a sun burn!! It stayed red for about 2 hours after and I was worried I did damage to my face!! Thank the Lord I did not!! At least, I can't see any damage. My face went back to normal after a couple of hours and I quit using it. This was the first time I ever tried a facial cleanser. I have very dry skin and I usually use dove soap to wash my face and body in the shower. I was told to use a moisturizing facial cleanser like ponds cold cream because soap strips the oils from the face. Well, I don't what it is in ponds cold cream to have caused that reaction, but I will not be using it ever again :( Back to dove soap for me!!!
__label__2 So NOT "Another Dumb Blonde!": Hoku is one of the most incredible singers to hit the music biz and this single proves it. Her stunning vocals in "Another Dumb Blonde" showcase what an incredible amount of talent the 18 year old daughter of Don Ho truly is. The emotional ballad "To Myself" has helped me through hard times and good times, the remixes are seriously kickin' and the cover art is great, it captures Hoku's youth and innocense perfectly. I am such a huge fan, that, with a little help from my e-pal Jordan, I have started a hoku webpage I think is well worth your time. Please check it out if your unsure of your purchase. It includes lyrics, audio/video clips, lots of pix and plenty of interviews. Thank you for your time and patronage!
__label__2 red meat for the starving masses: coreldraw is the rodney dangerfield of draw programs. It was pc only for several years and fell out of respect in the Mac dominated graphics world. Shane Hunt's book should help it regain some lost ground. This is not a beginner's book - for that use Coburn and Mccormick's "Official Guide". When you know how the tools work and you are beginning to wonder "is this all there is?" turn to Shane Hunt. The examples are not the usual pale little "tips" and "cute tricks" but full blooded (sometimes literally) ram intensive, graphic monsters that will expand your mind faster than a truckload of LSD. (and there's a whole chapter on psychadelia too, man). If you really want to see what coreldraw and you can do, this is the book.
__label__1 hp 8200e usb wont work with win 2000 pro....darnit !!!!!!!: Did a clean install of 98se to w2k pro. I can not get my hp 8200e to operate fully. I can burn small files and 1-3 mps'3 at a time but errors out if I cue up 10-12 mp3's. Also, If I try and burn a large data file it will error. ASPI ...checked and shows ok cdr software used 1) : easy cd 5.01 less take two 2) : various versions of nero 3) : clone cd also have tried various media. also have tried various hp driver updates, but only 5.0.2183.1 dated 11/14/99 will work.If you have any ideas.......????? yeah, I'd like to know
__label__2 Not my favorite 'megatron' depiction: This guy's airplane mode looks nothing like that of the Leader Class Megatron. His 'claw' is pretty awesome. Megatron is still as evil as ever. (Hold him up to the light and his eyes get a wicked glow!)
__label__1 Rip-Off Alert!: If you already own the excellent 6-disc Ernie Kovacs set that Shout Factory released last year, do NOT buy this disc. This release is nothing more than Disc #5 of that six-disc set repackaged, even to the extent of printing a new label on the disc itself. When you pop it into your dvd player, it will come up as "Disc 5" of that set. I can't believe Shout Factory is pulling this kind of nonsense. I have been very pleased with their product offerings in the past, but I guess those days are over -- I will be very leery of future Shout Factory offerings for fear that they are nothing but retreads of what I already own. Shame on you Shout Factory!
__label__2 Fear Factory's Worst: I have to agree that this album isn't no "Obsolete" or "Demanufacture", but it doesn't suck. This is how much I love Fear Factory. They are one of the best bands to ever grace the face of Earth. This CD has some great tracks on it. "Linchpin" is the best track on this CD. You will want to listen to it over and over. It never gets stale. "Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies)" is not the brutal "Soul Of A New Machine" Fear Factory that you'd expect, but it is a great song as well. The only flaw is the song "Back The F**k Up", that has that lamewad from Cypress Hill in it. In other words, this is a great album.
__label__2 animal antics- four seasons: This is a fabulous collection for adults as well as children, highly underrated., Shows real animals with wonderful voices, from british actors, from pond life to foxes, deer, and cats, dogs and rabbits, hedgehogs and every animal imagineable. It is witty, funny, and VERY educational, without being stuffy., Charming, BRAVO, pity more viewers are not aware of it. I want to buy the whole collection but cannot find anywhere to do so., The local library has it., but ot for sale. HELP I LOVE THIS COLLECTION AND I AM 57 GOING ON 7. SEE IT YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID, Carole
__label__2 it excelents: the product its excelent, I like and I purchased the next season with you. thank for that, i aprecciate that
__label__2 Childhood memories: When I was a child my mother listened to this album. I remember my mother singing along. The songs are short and delightful.
__label__2 Good but small.: I waited for years for this opera to be recorded. I was a bit disappointed. I recorded, live, the original broadcast from the Met. I live in Sierra Vista, AZ., and was very excited when it was broadcast live on KUAT, the night of Columbus day 1991, 500 years after Columbus discovered America. I was teaching music history at Cochise Collage at the time and had my students tune in for the broadcast. I could hear the prompter as he sang out the first words of various singers' first lines. But the live performance had a lot of excitement and the orchestra and performers were very good. It was a big sound. This recording was a bit of a let down. Sorry.
__label__1 Do not waste your money, AWFUL!: I received this as a gift, I'd always trusted the Stanley name. But it STINKS. It's worse than having nothing, as it arbitrarily beeps and never does in the same place twice; so you end up with either a false sense of information or totally confused. I've used this on easy drywall (1/2", 3/4") and it is horrible every time (even when I built the wall and knew exactly where the studs were, it didn't work right). I'm pretty mechanically inclined. Do not spend a dime on this, and certainly not $30--I've had $12 models that work far better. Stanley Tools, you should be ashamed, you really laid a log this time.
__label__2 Works as Advertised: It does what it says. It's a nice paper towel holder which we use on the inside of a lower cabinet. I did add a little piece of tape on the inside where the holder rests on the cabinet to keep the holder from moving back and forth when you open the door. I don't consider this a defect because everyone's cabinets will have a different thickness, so the holder has to be able to compensate. A little piece of tape and no more movement. Works great, disappears so everyone doesn't have to see it. I bought it to get the paper towel holder off the cabinet, and considered an "under-the-shelf" but decided it's best to keep as much free space as possible.
__label__2 Perfect multi-purpose pack: I purchased this backpack for school, and I love it. Its rated for a 17" laptop, but I haul around my 13" MacBook, along with all my textbooks, notebooks, and folders for college. What's more, with all the space this backpack allows, it doubles as a weekend pack for carrying clothes, etc, if I go hiking, or just if I want to pack light when we hit the road to visit family out-of-state.The only thing that can be said against it is the front flap, which is designed to drop down for easy access to the pouches beneath. It is only held up with plastic buckle clips, so it still droops down a bit if its weighed down too much. However, I just use it to hold pencils and notes, so it doesn't get weighed down enough to droop.All in all, I highly recommend this backpack to anyone who wants a pack with lots of space for college stuff and wants to be able to tote their laptop too.
__label__1 When reviewing my past orders.: When reviewing my past orders I find that I did not receive this order.Midsummer Magic (Magic Trilogy)Moonspun Magic (Magic Trilogy)Calypso Magic (Magic Trilogy). I did not find an area where I could notify Amazom, or where I could inquire about possible actions.
__label__1 Tisk Tisk: If you wanted to do Black Magick I think you could be a little more creative than this, people! Get some books on real Voodoun or Black Magick (which isn't related) and stop being so gullable. PLEASE!!!!!!
__label__2 gO gEt tHiS CD: Sup ya'll? I think you should definately go cop this album. I listen to the CD while cruizing or just chillin at the house. It has some tight a$$ beats to jam out to. C'mon, if you like "Lean Back" you gotta pick up the whole album, "True Stroy."
__label__1 Items not included: Sent as a gift for my granddaughter, who went from instant excitement to unhappy. The only thing in the box was the cage. No card to send in, no instructions, nothing. Can we say DISAPPOINTED?
__label__1 Pure Garbage: If misogyny, rape, torture and murder is what gets you off, then by all means be one more mindless whedon-drone and spend your money on this.But for the rest of us that have matured beyond comic book level writing and snuff fantasies save your cash.Season 6 is widely considered to be one of the worst (the worst is Season 7) one of Buffy and the one where the show jumped the shark.I fail to see how this can be called a &#65533;feminist&#65533; show when in the end all the shows women have been beaten, broken, raped or killed and the men get the big rewards (I guess if you try to rape someone you get your soul back.)Don&#65533;t waste your money. Don&#65533;t waste your time.
__label__2 Best Ever!: This is the best recipe box!!!! Durable, easy to clean, nice slot in front to stand recipe card up for easy viewing.
__label__1 "You Won't See Me" listening to this cd: this is basically a kidz bop bashing of old beatles' songs.i personally don't like it,almost hate it, but you very well might. most of the songs i find a little irritating, but not the songs themselves, just the cover of them. if you're a beatles fan, you might not like these songs so DON'T buy it unless you're sure, but if you have kids and are willing to compromise(or just like them this way) go ahead,it's your money, not mine. besides, it's better than some of the other kids albums out there. oh yeah, it's more of a 2 1/2, if you care.
__label__2 French Fan: Pour celles et ceux qui ne connaissent pas encore Laura. Auteur, compositeur, interprete. Et quelle interpretation : j'en ai parfois les larmes aux yeux (Proof) ! Et puis elle sait s'entourer des meilleurs musiciens. Quel talent !
__label__1 HaHa I fell for this years ago ...: It's so funny to look back at myself at the age of 20 and see my self wearing not 1 but 2 of these worthless items. Well, Now I'm 32 Years old and I can now laugh at how I really believed a smartly designed piece of tin (No Magnets) could give me extra strength. I have no faith or belief in Magnetic therapy. It's a catchy gimmick and that's all it will ever be. If you're into this type of stuff and you just want to blow away some cash get the Iron Man Mark VII magnetic bracelets (Yeah from the Avengers movie) At least with that you'll have a cool conversation piece but please don't put much stock in the Magnetic therapy part. Thanks for your time and I hope this has been helpful as well as a good laugh.Trion:Z Legend Bracelet (Carbon Fiber/Titanium)
__label__1 junk: i was not impressed by this game at all n64 was alot better than this game if you want a real game go get a gamecube halo didnt have that great of graphics either
__label__2 Really good light: If you have a pet, this is something you should have. It is unbelievable what can go unseen. This light provides the correct spectrum to uncover organic stains.
__label__1 Beautiful music but...: the constant noise of the river just really sounds like static--very annoying, in my opinion. If I am upstairs, I can hear just the music and it's better.I usually love music accompanied by the sound of water. However, on the other CD's and tapes I have, the sounds and tempo and intensity and kinds of water VARY.The river is a distraction--and this tape (surprisingly!) is advertised for meditation!
__label__1 Don't waste your money.: I bought this DVD based on the other reviews and frankly I was stunned when I got it. It looks like someone made it in a couple of days. It's just voice overs and pictures of old paintings and documents. No introduction, no comments by historians, no presenter visiting the places where events took place, no dramatic reenactments and no real analysis. It is boring beyond words.To make this awful production complete the voice they use for Luther is ridiculous. He sounds like he's doing a voice over for a B movie trailer.Don't make the mistake I did.Don't buy this DVD.
__label__1 Too Many Errors!!!!: This book is really bad for someone who doesn't have any too much experience in networking. Key points are just blurted out, while easy concepts seem to go on for pages. Finally, the question and answers are very error prone. Will confuse you if you don't take the time to reference errors.
__label__1 Stay away from this translation of Bulgakov's short masterpiece.: A terrible (abominably bad!) translation set to slipshod do-it-your typography. I just got this book and was amazed that this undergraduate-level attempt to English Bulgakov's prose is sold on Amazon. The translator was fortunate not to have his or her name credited anywhere between the covers. Don't expect an introduction to the author or the work, either. This is a home-spun desktop project from from first page to last. My advice is to buy the wonderful Grove Press translation by Mirra Ginsburg. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802150594/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_i1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0R5KW2HQ29X3R1MZNX4W&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=470938631&pf_rd_i=507846. You'll save yourself a few bucks to boot if you buy it used. Enjoy the novel!
__label__2 Gets the job done...: This card gets the job done. For may of us who don't have the latest high-end systems, this card is for you. I recommend getting 2 and connect together via SLI to get 1024x768 resolution.
__label__1 Poor Quality of the Air compressor: I got this kit at home depot. Strangly, it was much cheaper than what shows here. Now that I am done with the project, I was very happy with the kit. I used it for intense sheathing & framing. The compressor is more powerful and more quite than the porter-cable pancake one I also have, the nailer is awsome and well built. As I went up to 3.25" nails the nailer had trouble pushing them all the way when the head was not firmly against the piece, but shorter nails were no issue.It's a good kit, especialy for the price ($350).1 year Update: Do not buy this unit. First, the pressure regulator broke. I took it out and went around it, and then I started having electrical problems - the unit would not kick in and re-fill unless I played with the switch. Last time I am buying Hitachi - This is a low quality unit. They should be ashamed. The nailer seems good, though.
__label__2 Two presidents not compared often enough: "John Milton Cooper...blends these contrasting and kindred elements into a masterful portrait of two of our most intriguing presidents," David Kennedy in the New York Times Book Review, November 20 1983. TR and Wilson are often considered to be the same, especially in the in the domestic realm. The New Freedom was simply an extension of New Nationalism. But Cooper espouses the differences through analysis of both important domestic debates and the politics of war and internationalism. For anyone interested in studying Roosevelt, Wilson, and the Progressive era this book is an important read.
__label__2 Babylon Five - The Complete Second Seacon: Fine product. Now I have them all. Liked years 1-4 so much better than final year.
__label__1 Very poorly designed phone: I have had many cordless phones (including Panasonic - my last one did well), and this one is by far the worst. I was looking forward to long range and clear reception, but it falls far short of any expectations the cost should imply, and all the other problems render the phone almost useless. We had a lot of difficulty hearing anyone because the mic picked up every noise in the house while talking and fed it back in your ear. We had a problem with out-of range cut-outs when standing right next to the base unit. You can not program any function without the manual right there to read the codes. Even the layout of the buttons was poorly thought out. I think Panasonic came up with a big loser on this one. I wish I would have returned it shortly after I got it. It has since completely died - just quit working, a very expensive addition to the trash heap.
__label__2 Lots of good info: This book is a super complement to "The Bread Builders". Where this book really shines is in showing you how to dig up your own oven and start baking great bread for minimal cash outlay.If you are not an experienced bread baker, you will need some other resources to help you out (at least, I did), but there is enough info in here to get you going if you have kneaded a few loaves before.Nice book and a good addition to my research library.
__label__2 gripping tale of how to survive a S Bronx boyhood: I had heard Geoffrey Canada interviewed before about his memoir Fist Stick Knife Gun and was very impressed by his thoughtful memories of his S Bronx boyhood. This graphic novel, beautifully rendered by Jamar Nichols, is based on Mr. Canada's 1995 memoir of how violence pervaded his entire childhood in the S Bronx. The narration is very clear, matter-of-fact, and shows that a boy either fights or else becomes a victim. There is no place in-between-- a boy has to fight to protect himself, his friends, every single second of his waking hours in the S Bronx.I would have liked to give this graphic novel to my 7 year-old to read so that she can learn about how other kids grow up, but the numerous profanities will delay her introduction to Mr. Canada's work.Overall, very powerful and gripping. I read this in a single sitting and couldn't put it down. I was reading this book at the dinner table...
__label__1 God awful: Boring, uninspired. I couldn't even get through it. Sorry all you Jimmy Cliff lovers. I like his other stuff but this one sucked!!! BIG TIME
__label__1 Misleading Title!: You know when they say "Don't judge a book by it's cover?" Well here's a living proof of it! Well, the book is not about day trading. I founs perhaps around 3 or 4 sentences that talk about day trading and that's about it. The authors has focused more on his personal life. This should be named an Autobiography of Borsellino instead.However, he is a good writer and has written pretty well, I must say. His personal life experiences are very touching and interesting to read about. He does warn us in the beginning that he will be talking about his life, but I did not expect it to be of such *great* extent. Perhaps he believes that if we know about his personal life, and understand it deeply, then we will be better traders.The reason I am assigning a 2-star is just because of the misleading title of the book. But it doesn't mean that Mr. Borsellino is not a good writer. He writes very well indeed!Thank you, Steve.
__label__1 Ultraviolet digital copy is useless: The movie is great - 5 stars. The bait and switch performed by WB on this product merits a LOUD complaint. I signed up for flixster, saw what a stupid product it was, and complained online. The response was rapid - they emailed me an iTunes redemption code to get a REAL digital copy! Stand up for your rights to a quality product.
__label__2 Not your typical mob story: I delved into this book expecting the typical mob story: lots of violence, vendettas and brotherhood. That isn't what it is. Its certainly more of a character study, focusing on Billy and the boss, Dutch Schultz. I was disappointed at first, but next thing I knew I was done with the book and I think I enjoyed it. If it had been longer I think I wouldv'e lost interest though. Good length.
__label__2 Great product, great service: The book was in great shape and has a large selection of alphabet and number forms.
__label__1 Never read it.: I bought this for my husband and he has yet to read it. He said he tried a few times and then got bored. He did enjoy the pictures.
__label__2 Becareful What You Buy!: Touchdown Pass was to be sold only to libraries. Selling on the internet was not authorized. Book is very expensive. Chip Hilton has been copyrighted and trademarked--thus you may be buying a pirated copy of the book--be careful.Buy the real Chip Hilton books!
__label__2 The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible: My third attempt to review what I consider a great read. Subtle humor, coupled with historical data and the feeling of living in outback Alaska all combine to make this instructional manual a great enjoyment whether you brew beer, make wine or distill whiskey. If you do, it takes you throught the processes simply and comprehensively. As one, who doesn't let the sun set on a day that the "Devil's Brew" doesn't touch my lips I give Mr.Kania kudos. I expect many more smoke trails rising over America as this book reaches the masses. Robert J. Emmert, Radio Talk Show Host, Fort Myers, Florida
__label__1 Not good for our puppy: I got this bed for our 14-week old puppy's crate, but it is not working for us. She enjoys pawing at her bedding (as if making a nest) and this causes the bed to release large amounts of fluff which she then chews on. I don't know if she's actually eaten any of the fluff, but it's not worth the risk so we've taken the bed away and gone back to using towels. We will try this bed again when she's a bit older. If it didn't come apart so easily it would have been exactly what we wanted.
__label__1 Viet Nam Commemorative Sword: Nice keepsake.Steel was nice,but sheath is made of plastic.Not authentic for Viet Nam era.Iwo Jima was not in Viet Nam,(main design on the sword)
__label__1 DO NOT buy this iron!!: I never write reviews, but I am so mad at this iron, I thought maybe if I write a review, it will help save someone else from making a HUGE mistake.. The iron leaks water and not just a little, it POURS out water all over the clothes. I sent it back for repair and they sent it back to me with a section highlighted in the manual for leaking water, you hold the iron over a towel and push the steam button a few times. This did NOT solve the problem. It still pours water on the clothes and makes a huge mess. It is so bad that if you are ironing something to wear, you will have to wait an hour for the item to dry before wearing. HORRIBLE..
__label__2 A Great Season for America 's Favorite family: By far this is the best season out yet. There aren't any bad episodes and some are all time greats. My favorites were Homer at the Bat, Flaming Moe's, Bart's Friend falls in Love, and Treehouse of Horror II. The Special features are great a great and funny addition to your DVD collection
__label__1 Measures Temperature, Condensation inside Glass.: Used it once. After cleaning, inside the glass has condensation on it. I wonder how long it wall last. I have found that once this happens, the thermometers usually fail.
__label__2 AGAINST ALL ODDS--ISRAEL SURVIVES: WHAT GREAT TRUE STORIES ABOUT THE JEWSIH PEOPLE AND THEIR FIGHT TO HOLD ON TO THE LAND GOD GAVE THEM--MY GREAT GRANDSON WATCHED THEM WITH ME--MATTHEW WHO IS 81/2 YRS OLD--AND LOVED THEM. I HAD SEEN THEM ON TV BUT IT WAS NOT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS WAS IN THIS CD PACKAGE--THIS IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE--THANK YOU SO MUCH
__label__2 Very informative and inspirational.: If you're looking for inspiration and tips on nutrition and fitness and willing to take the plunge then Body for Life by Bill Phillips is the book for you. This book is filled with an impressive collection of inspirational `Before & After' photos and stories about people who have lost weight, reshaped their bodies and changed their lives. After reading the stories and looking at the photos you're all pumped and ready to read more. Phillips explains to the reader what carbohydrates, proteins and fats are by making it easy to understand. There's tons of information in this book just waiting to be read. In the back, there are also tons of different exercises for each body part.Everyone will be able to benefit from Body for Life, regardless of fitness level. It's definitely a must read!
__label__1 Disappointed with KitchenAid 4 1/2 Quart Mixer: Started using mixer in 2002...in Dec. 2004 had to take it in for service...all the oil had leaked out. Was told I didn't use it enough! Nearest authorized service center is 35 miles away. I threw away a 30 year old GE mixer when I purchased this one...wish I had it back. (I must now order a new cover since the old one is stained on four sides by oil.)
__label__2 Reguarding the fly..: And to think I was eating dinner when the fly was on the other night. I forgot how disgusting the scenes were. I don't remember the fly 2, but the fly isn't a bad movie, it's pretty old though and jeff goldblum has always been a great actor. I stomach alot even when eating food, i'm normally unfazed but this movie the fly can be quite nauseating lol. It was a little funny though when he was storing body parts in the medicine cabinet. I hadn't seen this horror flcik in years but i do wish i was not eating during the puss dripping, puking scenes and when his ear fell off and when he was all juicy and hair was growing in odd places and his nails falling off and puss squirtin' out. Oh yes good times, so what's for dessert?
__label__1 75 year old man attempt about a college his daughter went to: Crisp writing is the only positive remark I can make about this book. 75 year old men should lay off trying to write books that are blatantly insulting against a particular school that they have never attended and honestly know nothing about. I'm a student at the school and this book is a horrible and wrong representation of our university. Write about something you can actually relate to at some level.
__label__1 oh god!: I think that this singer has some vocal talent-although nothing in comparision 2 mariah carey. But her voice isn't horrible. If she could sing some songs thats style complimented her voice then she might be able to make somthing work for herself. But this CD is just a wreck. I pity anyone who wastes their money on it. I dunno if this was a joke or if the person was serious while making this but I dont think they should have attempted to recreate her voice or her songs. It just doesn't work. To be perfectly honest I really think it sounds like karoke. If you wanna by a mariah CD buy one of her own.
__label__1 Horrible "Romantic" "Comedy": If I hadn't spent over $20 to see this movie, my wife and I would have walked out of the theater. It was painful to sit and watch Reese's character go back and forth to that scumbag (played by Owen Wilson - who, btw, was the BEST part of this movie, ironically. But when Owen Wilson is the best part of a movie... something's wrong.)I'm a fan of the entire cast - Reese, Paul Rudd, Jack, obviously - but their characters' huge flaws made them totally unbelievable.It's not funny. It's not romantic. It's just a bad movie. (and not the good kind)
__label__2 Ups and Downs: The author does a great job alternating between the funny and the sad. It's a life story ride that is just wild enough to make you almost forget it's real. The same kind of book as Running With Scissors and My Fractured Life.
__label__2 It's very good, not perfect, but very good.: It is one of the few available for acoustic guitars. Seem to be made of reasonable quality materials. I didn't give it 5 * because is a little uncomfortable and makes your neck hurt a little, but I cannot imagine how they can fix this.It's a good buy and I would recommend to a friend.
__label__2 BETTER THAN EXPECTED: I am a big fan of peppermint hard candies and I'm always looking for a good deal. These are big chunks sweet peppermint and better than expected. At first I was a little disappointed but after awhile I was plesantly surprised at how flavorful these are. Give these a try.
__label__2 Beautiful: They call it a lasagna dish, but so much more has been cooked in ours. I reserve the fifth star for an item that goes stovetop to oven to microwave with no problems, and while this one can't do that it still earns a solid four.
__label__2 good solution.....: Simple to fit and a direct replacement.. Seems to be very good quality. Hope it never goes off. I have 13 off them and everything went without a hitch.
__label__1 Is It Over Yet; Why Can't I read faster: Terribly disappointing. Wish I could stop reading a book once I start it, because this would be one that would qualify. Story seemed convulted, boring, and way too technical that made it implausible. It was very hard to picture the final train scene. I did like the ending though (maybe because I couldn't wait to get there). Nowhere near as good as "Middle of Nowhere"
__label__2 Did the job: I actually though that the XBox DVD playback was excellent quality. And I don't mind subsidizing the cost of DVD playback ability to keep the price down. Even when I get a 360 or next gen I just might keep my xbox connected as a DVD player.What really made my day, though, was the ability to get this item on amazon. Sold out in every store in town for about a year now.
__label__2 Garmin case: Fits just right. Only thingfI noticed is you need to put it in the right direction or you will turn it on without realizing it.
__label__2 Have Trouble Motivating Yourself??? Listen to This!: YOU ONLY GET ONE SHOT. This is the secret of life. When you listen to this masterpiece, you hear the message of a young genius, born into poverty, who kept that secret in his mind and did not let anyone stop his methodical march to the top of the pop charts. I listen to this song, and it gives me the chills, because it tells the story of his life, and tells me to keep my focus, and keep on my march while the world is telling me "it can't be done." This song transcends the boundaries of pop, rap, poetry and words -- it is a slap in the back of the head that tells you to STOP WHINING AND FACE REALITY, while keeping the secret of life front and center in your mind. I defy you to not try harder to succeed after listening to this song. PARENTS: Forget the parental warnings! This is a "MUST LISTEN" for your kids!
__label__2 Story-telling at Its Best: Delightfully entertaining, touching, funny, and sometimes heart-wrenching, Philip Gulley's endearing stories of fictional small town Harmony are story-telling at its best. A page-turning snapshot of small town America, as seen through the eyes of the minister of its little church, and gently sprinkled with wisdom for living all our lives. A little reminiscent of TV's Mayberry stories.
__label__2 The Power Mid works great!!: These are the first Remote Control Extenders I have purchased. The only reason I bought them is because of the high reviews everyone else gave them. I just hooked them up, and so far they work great. It took 5 minutes to get them both plugged in to the wall, and set up where I wanted them. You don't have to connect to the satellite or television. Just plug them in and you are good to go. Now I can enjoy my satellite in 2 rooms without getting up to change the channel. Now I will take my chances and try the x10 audio video senders and see if the work too.If you are going to purchase RC extenders. Then these are the ones to get.
__label__1 do not like it at all.: Was not what I was expecting for a yoga video. Exercises are boring and each exercise takes forever to complete.
__label__1 Send ME your money instead of reading this: PFG (the authors company) was GIVING this away late March '02... Good thing too as its extremely weak. Almost half is devoted to Glossaries, Charts, and "standard FX agreement - easily downloadable from any FX firm). In fairness, the reading is a decent commentary regarding risks involved in FX. If your looking for some real "meat" to further understand FX, you wont find it here!
__label__1 Not Liking This Movie: Quite frankly, I thought this movie really stunk. The story line was very weak and the so-called romance not believable - it was based on nothing. I'm glad Steve Martin did Father of the Bride. That is his saving grace. He was good and fun to watch in that. I did not enjoy his character in this film. Not his fault entirely. He wasn't given much to work with. Sarah Jessica Parker's character was childish and moronic. The English woman's role had promise at the beginning but came to nothing and fell flat. Enya's music did not belong in this movie. Who put it there? She should have watched the movie first and then said, "Hell, no! I'm not putting my music in that!" Like I said, I'm glad he did Father of the Bride and Father of the Bride 2. He was good in those. You've got to have a good story to begin with.
__label__2 Lost 7 lbs and I'm toned!: I do this workout about 4-5 times a week and I've had it for over two months. During that time I've lost 7lbs just doing this workout and nothing else. My butt and thighs look really good now. My husband always comments on my new toned physique :) The first time I did the video I thought it may be a little too easy, but then the next morning I could barely walk. It took me two full days to recover and try the video again. Now I'm addicted to it!The workout itself is pretty boring and the music is bad, but it's easy to follow and and after doing it only a few times I just put it on my laptop next to the TV and watch TV shows while I go through the exercises. It takes about 45 minutes and I totally break a sweat.I have purchased other videos and I always go back to this one. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 The Best Work Out: I purchased Jillian's DVD after reading her book "Making the Cut". I wanted to see how to do some of the excercises described in the book. What I like most is, she explains why you are doing the excercise, demonstrates the proper way to do it and tells you what you should be feeling. It is like having a personal trainer, working with you. Believe me I have had a personal trainer, so this is me much better. The workout will make you sweat and you will get results, if you are willing to follow. I have purchased 3 of her DVD's for some variety and gave one to a friend. My friend absolutley loved it!
__label__1 Met + San Francisco Orchestra = Pretty interesting show: This is definitely a different approach by Metallica and any metal band for that matter. I absolutely love Metallica and yes I do own this title however if you really knew Metallica and loved their heavy stuff, this won't do it for you. While I only give it 2 stars, I really think that its a descent live show. I wish they would have had more than just 2 new tunes to offer up here. Pretty cool hearing some of the older Met tunes with the symphony behind them. Its not a terrible album and it may grow on me, but it does seem kind of gimmicky.
__label__2 I loved it!: I found this book to be very enjoyable. It was funny! I laughed at the naughty play on words throuhout the book. It was also a sweet story. I imagine that I will read this one again, also the stories about the girls.
__label__2 Great solution for Grandparents: Wanting to have seating for our 2 grandchildren (under 1 year old) but not wanting the expense and space requirements of conventional high chairs, we chose the Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair. This chair secures firmly to our kitchen table and is very easy to attach to the table when our grandchildren visit. An excellent product.
__label__1 Why Can't This Be Van Halen?: I have been into Van Halen since VHI! I loved Dave with the band and I love Sammy with the band. Gary's vocals just get on my nerves!! This is the first VH CD I have not played like 50 million times. I played it once, was shocked! I played it again, I just wanted to lose my lunch. SO on my CD rack it sits. All I can say is WHY?
__label__1 Smells funny: Fits fine seems to work fine, but the exhaust air smells like mothballs. I have only run the vacuum for about 20 minutes since installing this filter, so I hope it will settle down. Probably should have returned it and bought the standard version.
__label__1 mumbo jumbo: what a bunch of nonsense-- repeated over and over. Don't buy this book. I'll send you mine.
__label__2 It's A Filter: It's a filter, and it fits. Nothing fancy, but it's much cleaner than the old one. Pretty fair price too.
__label__2 Rich in Joy: This CD is rich in joy and in the South African textures of voice, instrument, and rhythm.
__label__2 Good value: For the price, this dog rain coat is a great buy. I have a long basset hound and it fits lengthwise. It does hang on the ground and makes him look like a sunnyside-up egg, but that's not the coat's fault. It's easy to put on and is sturdy.
__label__2 Great system: This little stereo system is definitely an excellent deal. The sound is big and beautiful. It's not a 'micro' or even a 'mini' system, but it's not really large either, somewhere in between. The only con is that it's slightly confusing to use initially - it just doesn't seem very intuitive, so reading the instructions is necessary, boo. But overall I would highly recommend it if you're looking for a very reasonably priced, great sounding cd player and radio.
__label__2 Enlightening and Informative: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this wonderful book. Truly eye-opening and informative for anyone thinking of how to raise their kids in today's upside-down world of education.
__label__2 Pac's best album: You could feel his anger on almost all his songs. And that's what makes, it so raw, originial and, overall, REAL!! He was the realest artist I ever heard. Just listen to his interviews. There will never be another Pac, RIP.
__label__1 i would not recommend this product: This product only sounds good after fiddling with the individual volume channels for each speaker, and even then the quality is not good. The major drawback is that this systems volume can not be programmed on a universal remote. On the universal remote, major drawback with this device. Other than that the menu is only active in DVD/Disc mode... and will randomly reset the menu and volume settings. I would not recommend this product!
__label__2 Works exactly as advertised: Everthing about the transaction went perfect. I only wish multiple item recieved a discount on shipping. Paid $11.00 to ship two items that could fit into an envelope and weigh less than 2 oz.
__label__1 Deceptive packaging: The product is OK, but the packaging is deceptive. More than half the jar is a false bottom. You think you are getting way more than what you actually do.
__label__2 The definitive book on maximizing performance in sports: I have read numerous books on achieving competitive excellence in sports and even ones that claim to give the secrets to achieving that elusive "zone" state but they all pale in comparison to "Achieving Competitive Excellence". This book gives concrete ways to boost an athlete's performance. Where other books focus on cognitive behavioral approaches, this book gets right to the core issues and addresses the emotional components that hold athletes back and it is written without technical jargon. This is a must read for parents, coaches and athletes.
__label__1 A bit uneven...there's better smooth compilations: Not the strongest compilation I've heard for the market they seem to wish to tap (chill-out, lounge, ambient vibe). It starts out cool enough ("All I Ask" by Rae & Christian, and the misfire #3 "Ten" by Fauna Flash isn't chilled in any way, as it totally houses-out the CD early on and smashes whatever mood it was going for), but it doesn't give us a really classic chill-out track until #5, Hazy Roomz's "Herbal Essence", which is a reggae dub-style grinding number with a strong, super-smoothed out vocal on top. After that, it goes in some almost-cool directions with (#6) Futuremind's "Thru Da Mist" and (#9) A Forest Mighty Black's "Sunday City Sequence", but there's simply not enough strong tracks on here to recommend for new purchase unless you're a DJ looking to pad out his or her after-3 set.....
__label__1 It's so god-awful it's funny!: Surely Trent Reznor is kidding us, right? Is this the most immense satire on self-absorption and self-pity, or is this for real? Oh, my poor baby!None of this is worth getting; I'd sooner listen to N-Sync, for god's sake!
__label__1 Don't buy this book -- get Princeton Review instead: I bought this book (no CD-rom) and also got the Princeton Review book (with CD-rom). After going through the Princeton Review book, I realized how poor the Kaplan book was. (see my review for the Princeton Review book, with CD-rom). Looking back, I realized that the Kaplan book offers few tips and strategies that are useful during the actual test. Save your money and don't buy this book. You're better of going online and getting free reviews through websites....
__label__1 Surfing the Himalayas of Rama's Ego: I've just finished reading Lenz's "Surfing the Himalayas of My Ego" book. The first part of the book read like a high school girl's diary, then the writing style tightened up and actually wasn't bad. So too, a bit of content was interjected that was reasonably decent. Then the sh** storm started, a storm that was so incredibly logically inconsistent that it was offensive. But still fascinating. And we're not talking about inconsistent with respect to external frameworks, we're talking inconsistent within the framework in which the tale is set. Buying into that load would require extreme gullibility and the complete suspension of all of one's critical facilities. One begins to see where mind-altering drugs were a necessary part of the Lenzian "gatherings in the desert". Seriously, the book has no depth and it not only ignores standard tenets of Buddhism, it occassionally contravenes them as well.
__label__1 Avoid this company!!: Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline. Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month?? They refuse to refund or replace. They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same.
__label__1 I can't believe Oxford is still backing the useless iFinger interface.: Starting with the good aspect of New Oxford Dictionary of English, it contains 350,000 words and is unquestionally the best English dictionary available on a single CD today.The interface itself is intolerable (even offensive), so much so that I have deleted this dictionary from my system. Why can iFinger not create an interface that will remember its settings? Through correspondence with iFinger "support" (which is not really support at all), I have discovered iFinger has no intention of creating a decent interface which must, by definition, remember its settings.The iFinger interface is completely sad given the quality of the New (350,000 word) Oxford Dictionary of English.My recommendation: Buy the Tenth Edition Oxford Dictionary on CD-ROM or download the free WordWeb dictionary, both excellent, both of which can remember their settings.
__label__1 Into the West- DVD: I loved Into the West when we viewed it on television. I was however, very disappointed when we watched the dvd that I ordered from you. It didn't have the whole story as the TV version. After reading the reviews, I noticed that my opinion was not the only one with the same complaint.What a disappointment. I would not recommend this dvd if you watched the mini series on television.
__label__2 Excellent Storytelling: The style and format of this book permits the reader to get a better picture of the battle scenes than many other Civil War publications. I am not particularly fond of fictionalized history BUT I think the benefits to the reader outweigh my own personal bias. This type of literature and this book in particular are great vehicles to get younger readers interested in a very important period of American History. Well worth it.
__label__1 A distortion of reality.: The author is ignorant of the facts and distorts information in order to convince the reader that they should be living in a lead building to protect themselves from natural radiation. A waste of money.
__label__2 Heart-breaking tale of survival: Like the hero of "All the Pretty Horses," the first book in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy, Billy Parham is a teenager who crosses the border into Mexico, where he must struggle for survival at a primitive level. At first, he makes the crossing to release a wolf he has trapped and cannot bear to kill. Later, he returns with his brother. In the course of this novel, Billy undergoes just about every misfortune it is possible to encounter, becoming progressively more wretched until the final pages, an understated vignette with a potent, heartrending effect.McCarthy is a fine writer and story-teller, particulary in the early section concerning the wolf, but I have to remove a star because of a number of dull episodes in which Billy encounters various old Mexicans, gypsies, and soldiers who inflict their convoluted philosophies upon us.
__label__2 What every WingNut needs: Lavish photos, behind the scenes on the set, Sorkin's inception of the project, script details, it just goes on and on. The only problem is that there isn't one for each season!
__label__1 Magellan Maestro 3100 - Fair: Bought this on a friends recommendation. Also bought a TomTom at the same price. The Magellan is not as good as the TomTom. The maps in the Magellan are out of date and you can't edit them, on the TomTom the maps are current and you can edit them. TomTom is more user friendly and I like the display better. For the money, get the TomTom due to much better support, friendliness of use and current map.
__label__2 Fl bulbs: Why not? Save money. Save Time, Last longer. Make sure they will fit - sometimes a little too big.
__label__2 His funniest Book!: If you're new to Moore (maybe after seeing his Oscar speech or Bowling for Columbine) and you're thinking about reading one of his books then start with this. It's his first and funniest book. Stupid White Men is great, but I didn't bust a gut like I did when I read this one.Here's my suggestion: read this one whenever and then read Stupid White Men and Dude, Where's my Country back to back. Also, be sure to watch his films for a more moving expirience.
__label__1 Don't Bother Buying: I found this collection to be nauseatingly self-referenced and ultimately a bore. I actually couldn't listen to each song all the way through. I gave it away to another Simon fan and she gave it away as well. There is one song with some banjo music which peaked my interest briefly but other than that, this music is horrlbly unlike any of his other attempts to entertain. I still regard his first two solo albums and "Graceland" to be his best. Paul, you're NOT the one this time.
__label__1 Fragments: Fragments...the best way to describe this DVD. The third leg of the Elevation tour - performed in the fall of 2001 - was very different to the first leg performed in the spring. The 3rd leg took on all of the emotion of the 9/11 attacks, and U2 did an heart-wrenching job of uniting our emotions.Unfortunately, this DVD is from the first leg (i.e., pre-9/11). Much of the content of the 3rd leg is missing. And unbelievably, "One" is missing from the DVD setlist. Is "One" a song that is just so sacred that it will never be shown?I also agree with other reviewers around the country who have complained that this DVD is disjointed and fragmented. It is little more than a collection of photographs set to music. It is by no means a view from a front-and-center seat with a start-to-finish view of the concert.
__label__2 fun wtih the Polar express: My 3 year old son got this (and the other parts of the Polar Express Brio train) for Christmas. He is a HUGE fan of the movie and LOVES these toys. We have read the book so many times and seen the movie even more times that we set up the train and he runs the movie plot right there in the living room. Brio makes good quality stuff and even the price on Amazon seemed pretty reasonable!
__label__1 The Story of a Sellout: What happened, Slipknot? I wil ltell you, you let Corey Taylor right your songs. This cd goes from great to awful, and makes me want ot hurl. It cannot compare to Iowa, or S/T. Slipknot is not the type of band that goes from Surfacing to Vermillion. It saddens me to see this happen. The great parts are The Blister Exists, Three Nil, Duality, and Opium of the People. Everything from this point...collapses. Vermillion? Now with a music video that is fully equipped with crap. Slipknot is dead, unless they can make a good cd after this, but since I really did like them at one point, I'll buy it.
__label__1 java programming TOOLS in linux(redhat): I don't know if the other reviewers have read the books carefully or not because the books have been over-rated. First of all, the book is filled with reference stuff for both linux and java which do not help people to understand either of them. The useful stuffs are to help people WHERE to get java softwares, HOW to install them and how to CONFIGURE them both as SYSTEM wide and USER limited usage and HOW to RUN THE SOFTWARES. In these aspects, the book did not do a very good job. The one website the book referred to is BLACKDOWN which is a good site but the java softwares there are not updated often( it still carries jdk1.2 beta ! ).In conclusion, the book should be trimmed down in half and emphasizes more in those aforementioned stuffs and cut the price. To be fair, the book does contain some good stuffs but these are rare.
__label__2 Man of Color: An Autobiography of John Alexander Somerville: This compelling story was written by a 20th century black man who overcome enormous prejudice to become successful. This man, John Alexander Somerville, describes his experiences in a powerful, memorable manner.
__label__2 Great little knife for the price: We bought this paring knife as a replacement to our missing Henckels paring knife. This one is definitely sharp and appears to be made better than our original knife. My only qualm about this one is that the blade is pretty short but I am slowly getting used to it.
__label__2 moving!!! many a bad girl's dream. an unparalled voice!!!!!: this cd is a must for anyone who ever loved and lost. it is raw emotion laid bare. as open and honest as it gets! Any opportunity to see Burton live should be taken. He captivates an audience like no one else. Would that all the solo stuff he has put out be made available. For anyone who would like to see Burton on the silver screen, don't miss "Melanie" an early 80's film starring Paul Sorvino, Don Johnson and Glynnis O'Connor. Burton also has tracks on the soundtrack for the movie California Dreamin'. I never tire of the vocal prowess this man has been gifted with. I bought 2 of this one and have highly recommended it to many friends!!!!! Wear a rhinestone tie and carry a white rose. Cleveland never sounded so good!!!!
__label__2 One of the finest: I watch this film, and I can see where Ernie Kovacs came from. I also note that a lot of the gags and set up in the film spilled over into the Warner Brother's cartoons of the era, and much later, with references to the way the film is being used. Not the camera, the film itself (to be understood if you see the DVD).This was based on a Broadway play, it was a shapeless play, was different every night and before it became a movie had the distinction of running longer than any other broadway play.Describing it only tends to spoil the viewing you will have later. I knew about the movie as a rumor and as a "you have got to see this film!!" kind of introduction. Some of the best dancing you will ever see on film.Many laughs, much fun. Martha Raye is pretty good, though the "weirdness" of being a man chaser seems a little dated, and I met a few like that and didn't react the way it's placed in the film...(oh, never mind).
__label__2 Classic Soundtrack. The King Is Coming.: The original soundtrack of KING KONG is a big success. Max Steiner does terrific work here, indicative of future success ("Gone With The Wind," "Casablanca," etc). If you loved the movie, you'll love the soundtrack. And I also recommend the 2005 film AND soundtrack.
__label__1 Not Worth The Money Don't Buy: I bought this for my son as an anniversary present and ended up giving him the money instead. Heater is a joke but I am not laughing. I am angry at myself for not reading more reviews before I shelled out money for this product. Going to send it back and try to recoup some of the money. My son is the only one who won out because I had to give him the reciept in case he wanted to return it and he saw the price so he ended up with $400.00 the price of the heater when I bought it back from him. Edenpure Heaters will leave you cold.
__label__1 Power Cord & Dial unreliable: Only have used the product two times and the numbers have rubbed off the dial. The power plug doesn't want to stay inside the unit. The look of the unit is nice, but the power cord and dial need an improvement. I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone until they get this fixed.
__label__1 Bad Form: This quote is fallaciously attributed to Thomas Jefferson. He said no such thing.I would like to repeat something said by that great philosopher Frederick of Honolulu. He said "Repeating silly quotes is the highest form of bad form." Only a liberal nut-job would consider "dissent....the highest form of patriotism", not reasoned and rational dissent, just mere dissent. Using that sort of messed-up logic would make all the enemies of my country (the USA), patriots, since they certainly are dissenting. It is a silly saying. Dissent from anyone that so highly regards this absurd and ridiculous motto.
__label__2 A very good overview of TCP/IP protocols: This book describe the TCP/IP family protocols. Of course, there is so much to say that in the limited space that a book can offer that I would say that the book presents only a quick overview of the protocols. Fortunately, at the end of each chapter, there are pointers on the relevant RFCs for the discussed topic in that chapter. My next statement is an impression and not a proven fact but by having read the first edition a long time ago, I have the impression that some details have been removed in this edition in favor of a better coverage of more new protocols. That being said, the information contained in the book is extremely accurate and the book is very useful when analyzing the output of a packet sniffer such as WireShark (previously known as Ethereal).
__label__2 Who Could Ask for Anything More...: ... to quote the great Ethel Merman. Barbra Streisand has created a beautiful, haunting album of love songs in "A Love Like Ours." With a voice from God, Streisand sings some great songs and some good ones, and has NEVER SOUNDED BETTER! 5 STARS PLUS.
__label__2 REMASTERED!: A while back, Warner Brothers Japan re-released 12 Neil Young titles. The surprise was that remastered content appeared for the first time on most of them.The titles & WB-Japan catalog numbers are:Neil YoungWPCR-75086Everybody Knows This Is NowhereWPCR-75087After The Gold RushWPCR-75088HarvestWPCR-75089On The Beach WPCR-75090Tonight's The NightWPCR-75091ZumaWPCR-75092Long May You RunWPCR-75093American Stars n' Bars WPCR-75094Comes A TimeWPCR-75095Rust Never SleepsWPCR-75096Live RustWPCR-75097I picked up most of these, A/B'd them, and found them to be superior to the domestics. However, having purchased the domestic 2002 remasters of "Beach" and "Stars n Bars", I declined the Japan versions of those two titles.Unfortunately, while the Japan version is remastered, Live Rust is not restored to the original LP's running form, and remains still the bastardized version.If you own the U.S. versions, and you're a NY fan, I would seriously consider replacing them with these.
__label__2 great buy: I searched for months for the tv that would have a great picture, sound, and still look good in my living room, not like those bulky big screens that you just plop down in a corner somewhere, unable to ever move. I have a habit of sitting close to the television on an angle, and I know that alot of projections don't really allow this kind of viewing so that was an important feature. This tv has an excellent picture from almost any angle in my living room.I have to be honest though- my favorite feature of this television is the look. It basically has a base, with the creen on top of it. The silver color also adds a bit of flair....
__label__1 ABBOT AND COSTELLA RANGERS: PCN DOES A TERRIBLE JOB ON ITS PRODUCTIONS FOR THESE WALKS..THIS ONE I HAD TO WATCH 45 MIN OF RAIN DROPS ON THE LENS..WHO EDITS THIS STUFF? AND IF THAT IS NOT BAD ENOUGH LBG TIM SMITH AND GARY ADELMAN ARE TERRIBLE..IF YOU THOUGHT THAT FIGHTING AT THE ROSE FARM AND WHEATFIELD WAS CONFUSING TRY WATCHING THIS DVD..INSTEAD OF TRYING TO LAY OUT THE EVENTS OF WHAT HAPPEND THERE I FOUND MYSELF WATCHING GUYS HOLDING UP PICTURES OF MONUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MOVED..I REALLY DONT CARE IF THE MONUMENT WAS MOVED, JUST TELL ME SOMETHING OF THE BATTLE HERE...AGAIN PCN DOES NOT PAN TO ANYTHING AS THE GUIDES ARE TALKING SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE..THESE GUIDES KEEP TURINING OVER TO EACH OTHER AND EACH ONE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS SO CONFUSING YOU WILL NEED SOME TYLENOL AND SOMEBODY THAT REALLY KNOWS THE STORY TO SORT IT ALL OUT..SAVE YOUR CASH ON THIS ONE..
__label__1 Run away! Get the sand version.: This was a huge waste of money. The ants took forever to ship, as many other reviewers have pointed out, but my real complaint is that they never really dug in. They arrived alive, but never did any tunneling. Eventually, they died ... probably of boredom. I just finally threw it away today.Get the sand version ant farm. We've had those in the past and they're fun (although you're still going to have to wait eons for the ants to arrive).
__label__1 Trials of the Famous: While the book was readable I was acutally dissapointed in the fact that what trials were included, they didn't seem to be well searched out, more as though they were writing about gossip on the street. I hate to say anything bad but I do not believe that this is worth the money I spent to purchase it with.
__label__2 a voice teacher and early music fan: PLEASING TO THE EAR, BUT NO EXCITEMENT I FEAR!This is a pleasant album with a nice variety of songs some of which I have not previously encountered.Drew Minter's voice is correct in every way; that is: nice tone quality, accurate pitch and excellent diction. BUT there is no excitement to be had; there is no emotion to latch onto. He sings "O Solitude" just the same as he sings "Crown the Altar" which contain totally different meanings. His best renditions are: "Lord, What is Man" and "Be Welcome then,Great Sir". The only thing I detect that conveys some sense of drama are changes in volume.These songs can be very meaningful when the performer takes note of the song's message.The accompanying instruments are excellent and the album is worth buying if you are "hooked on" Purcell.But I suggest you try Michael Chance or David Daniels for exciting renditions of these wonderful songs.
__label__1 2 Different Movies: My wife and I really enjoyed the first half of the film. It had some gotchya moments and genuine scares. The second half of the film (pretty much when the ghost hunters arrived and thereafter)went quickly downhill in my opinion. The movie actually became quite silly and slipped into absurdity. And that ending...ugh.
__label__2 put this in your car radio...........: That is how I know how well an album is. If i like the album when I'm driving, then I know it's a keeper. I typically listen to stone temple pilots/third eye blind/korn/fuel/etc. Smartbomb's music rocks and is full of colors and harmony. It may seem different at first, but the songs are so well made that you will be singing along in no time. Their guitar sound is great and the vocals are nothing like I've ever heard before. Buy the music and you will be pleasantly surprised...........
__label__1 JUNK!: Within a couple months my "protective" case was split, cracked, the rubber feet lost, etc.. under normal use and without any falls or drops of the computer.Simply made of cheap junk plastic, for $49!!!!
__label__1 Not too bad: Too loose for the HX2495B. I have a white case that came with the device and that is ferfect for it. But the black case I bought does not fit very well in my HP HX2495B.
__label__1 book purchase review: This book arrived in good condition but was a library book complete with end page stamps, plastic unremovable cover, and a card envelope in the back endpaper. This was not as advertised and not at all welcome. I would not have purchased the book if I had known this was the case. No way to know that it wasn't stolen from the library.
__label__1 Typical: I used to be a big fan of Brand New's second album, DEJA ENTENDU, so I bought this one. I was unimpressed. This is a very typical pop-punk emo angst CD. A few of the tracks are all right ("The Shower Scene," for example), but there is nothing very impressive here.If you're a fan of DEJA ENTENDU, don't bother. If you're a fan of SUM 41 or GOOD CHARLOTTE, go for it.
__label__2 Great Diaper: I love these diapers. Most of the time they don't leak, but every diaper I have bought (even Huggies overnights) leak on occasion. The only issue with these diapers is that they run a little small. I always go one size up. The tabs are nice and wide and the diaper itself is super soft and flexible. Other earth-friendly diapers are very stiff. Definitely give this one a try if you are looking for a less toxic diaper. :+)
__label__1 Disappointing: Bought this on the strength of one song. The remaining songs are dated, uninspired generic folk singer/songwriter schtick/slop. Damn you Pandora!
__label__2 The Perfect Nailer: I consider the PASLODE cordless 16 gauge angled finish nailer the perfect finish nailer. It's light, convenient and does a GREAT job. Having completed several smaller projects with it at this point, it has yet to mis-fire or jamb. The depth adjustment works like a dream. I give this unit my highest recommendation.
__label__2 Fun!: The cats are enjoying their new toy, they love the furry effects of it and are throwing it all around.
__label__2 A PERFECT GIFT: I was delighted with the quality! They are delicate, not imposing looking. My daughter-in-law will LOVE them. Thanks for the prompt delivery too!
__label__2 A Modern Horror Novel: I read this book as a straight-up horror novel. It doesn't work any other way. If you take it on as serious social commentary, an examination of school shooters, serial killers, nature vs. nurture, marriage and parenthood, the book turns silly and repellent. Approaching it as a horror novel featuring one of my favorite plot devices -- the unreliable narrator -- allowed me to truly inhabit Eva's point of view and to relish the tale's shocking (and campy) ending.
__label__1 Not Worth Reading: I was sorely disappointed in King & King & Family. Readers will have no emotional connection to this story. There isn't any plot; it's just a hodgepodge of ideas and cute illustrations. It's not worth buying. If you're looking for great children's books about family diversity, particularly ones involving homosexuality, I advise "And Tango Makes Three" (true story about two male penguins adopting an egg), "The Family Book" (guidance), "Saturday is Pattyday" (about parent's separating), or "The Daddy Machine" (goofy) instead.
__label__2 A different reading experience: Plenty of reviews have already covered plot summary. What gripped me was how McCarthy stripped down the prose (hard to read at first, but then it worked with the overall tone of the book) to the same desolate state as the world created. Even though he doesn't use names (except once) and dialogue and descriptions are stripped down to a minimum, its amazing how much you fill out in your mind which makes it a rich experience. Similar to a horror movie that only alludes to the actual crime, sometime the mind fills in much better than full disclosure. I felt the pain of the road, the cautious nature of discovery, the joy of finding minor treasures, and ultimately the pain and strength of love. This is an excellent read that will challenge you, if you let it...
__label__1 DVD Purchase: I never actually got the product. I got an email from the business saying they had shipped the wrong item and they credited my Discover card. I never received anything.
__label__2 Love Bruce Campbell - he chooses his roles well.: Bruce may seem a little typecast in his roles, but he is very intelligent and chooses the roles he will fit into best. He doesn't need to audition for roles, they ask him, so he can choose the best ones. Once again this is a great movie and Bruce is, as always, excellent. I cannot wait to watch the next episode of Burn Notice!
__label__2 Surprisingly Fresh New Translations: Towards the end of the nineteenth century fundamental changes in being a Jew in Europe were under way. There was a movement within the German Jewish intellectuals that began to integrate more closely with the non-Jewish society. As with all times of change, this was a time of confusion as the changes filtered through Jewish society. And this change was reflected in the plays that were being written, in Yiddish of course.This book is both a new translation of some of these plays, and a critical analysis of these plays in conjunction with the history of those times. Surprisingly the plays, now available in English for the first time show a freshness and timelessness that is surprising in the light of all that has gone on since.This is a welcome addition to modern Jewish literature as befits the SUNY series in Modern Jewish Literature and Culture.
__label__2 ITS WORTH GETTING IT!: I belong to a Praise Musical Team at my church and someoneintroduced me to Jars of Clay. Wow! The first one,wasthe most refreshing music I have ever listened to,comparedto these bands that are all sounding the same! So any way,I callThe first Jars of Clay album, the "Abbey Road". Now withthe ZOO cd ,I call this "SGT Peppers" cd. It is a littlewerid as you first hear. They have listened a lot to the Beatles, the writting staff for each song is superb! But listening to it again and again, vocal harmonies,would sound like Paul McCartney ,belting out a vocal line.This band is the bestband that has hit the christian music seen in ages,these guysare more than just creative,they are incredible! Buy the 1stJars cd,then buy Scared(2ndone),then the Zoo will make perfectsense. Wonderful! Cant get enough!
__label__1 Whisper louder, the music is too loud and not very good: I respect the four philosophers presented in these recordings. Was really looking forward to using these recordings, but really only listen to the Deepak Chopra CD. The music is not that soothing and usually too loud compared to the female voices used to deliver the positive affirmations. The music and vocal tracks are not mixed well and it is more frustrating trying to understand what is being said, so be prepared if you choose to purchase this product. The female voices are also quite irritating to listen to, except the Chopra CD. The music is lacking in soothing vibrations and is also irritating. Not a good buy. Keep looking there are many excellent products out there. Peace, Ellen
__label__1 Disturbing and Inappropriate: I find it inconceivable that people will slam Harry Potter for its lack of Christian values, but recommend the Lemony Snickett series. That anyone could enjoy a book whose sole plot is a sick old man trying to marry his 14-year-old niece to get her fortune is disturbing to me. The strange warning to the hook man that Violet is "his" and a reference to the "wedding night" are beyond disgusting. The poor writing, demeaning definitions and lack of any real literary value add up to a cheap piece of trash...
__label__1 CRAP: Crap. Plus really obnoxious music. What was the story? A waste of a talent like Cate Blanchett. She must have needed the money.
__label__2 This great 'B' Movie is a guilty pleasure: No one is ever going to accuse The Beastmaster of being one of cinema's crowning achievements, but it is an entertaining bit of escapism. It stands side-by-side with Flash Gordon (1980) as my favorite 'B' movie, although Flash Gordon is much more overtly campy. Make Moses look like Conan and act like Dr. Dolittle, and you've pretty much got the plot. Marc Singer makes a great protagonist - his physique is only a hair less imposing than Arnold's, and he's a heck of a lot better actor. I'd call this the best fantasy movie ever made, but that's kinda like giving out an award for the least smelly pair of unwashed feet. Turn off your brain and let yourself enjoy this one.
__label__2 Staple for gluten free diets: There aren't a lot of grab and go types of foods for gluten free diets. If you're watching carbs too, it doesn't get any better than the ThinkThin bars. I keep a box in my desk drawer and another at home. The white choc chip is my favorite.
__label__2 the five people you meet in heaven: The best book!!! My whole family has read this book!!! It really make you sit back and think, I love this book..
__label__1 Why does everyone say this is great movie?: Why does everyone put four or five stars for this movie??? Barrymore is completly miss casting as Cinderella. She is not a image of Cinderella at all to me. Only Anjelica Houston is correct at casting as the step mother. I enjoyed the "Disney Cinderella" more than this. I shouldn't of bought this video and I wish my money will come back!!!
__label__1 !!!!!!!!!!!!: when i heard this stupid a$$ cd i had to laugh so loud!!!!! it is gotta be the stupidest stuff ever there like the rap and r&b boy band stupid stuff that is what i like to call straight up wack(this cd is 100% wack ya dig?)
__label__2 Comprehensive: I wanted to better understand the weather. How do systems form, how do they move, what causes it to rain? With no prior reading or knowledge on the subject, this book provided a clear, concise explanation that will help any reader better understand the nightly weather forecast and appreciate all of the variables that make an accurate forecast so difficult.
__label__1 maybe an easy read for a pre med student!: Not an easy read.The information was not in lay terms.The information was good, but over complicated.
__label__2 Perfekt musik: Kraftwerk are the musical equivalent of BMW and Mercedes-Benz.Pure perfection in sound, rhythm and harmony.Enjoy.
__label__2 Not for Marine Binoculars: These are not made for the Marine binoculars. You can get them to connect, by tying the ends after feeding them through the small slots in the binoculars. They are not quick disconnect. It is a nice strap, it's just that I wish I had verified the compatibility w/my new marine binoculars.
__label__2 Perfect!: After looking at several different brands I chose this one based on its rating. Some liked it a lot and some didn't. I figured for the money it was worth the risk. I went out to my truck will all my tools ready for it to take an hour or so. After 5 minutes and only 2 tools later I was done. It went in perfectly. Everything fit like it was suppose to, everything looks like it's suppose and everything works like it's suppose to.I highly recommend this product as a quick, easy, affordable and high quality upgrade.
__label__2 The Singer: The Singer being Galás 1992 release is her singing own versions of classical blues and gospel songs. Galás has very unique vocals and one always here that it is here singing. The cover is an alright photograph of Calás looking pensive but the hair is not so nice. Only two of the tracks have lyrics but we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5.
__label__2 Serves a Purpose: This book is Academic. Don't expect to read it in one night, because its full of facts and can cause your mind to wonder. It is not "Lord of the Rings", but a Business book to learn.It is factual and a must for those who need/want to understand the collection of consumer information, stats, cost control, and inventory control. Great for Accountants, retailers, and businessman.
__label__2 Mortar and Pestles: A great purchase for the price. I like having the options of different sizes for the jobs I need it for. Found that the grinding was very fine. And when I added solutions to mix the seeds to make the different paste I was able to get the right size bowl that did a great job mixing the potions.
__label__1 reason for my returning this product: I am returning this product because , although good quality, they do not fit my frigidare stove. They do not stay in place. This product should state what stoves they will fit. Also I am not pleased that I have to pay return shipping. I have bought a few other items from amazon and was very satisfied.
__label__1 This book is as close to fiction as a biography can be.: Gordon's research is indeed thorough but in a failed attempt to come up with a new angle on Gen. Pickett she has rashly and by all accounts innaccurately, drawn many an absurd and far fetched conclusion. Her accusations are both silly and shameless, and supported by nothing more than the common misconceptions about the General that became popular after the war. For a more credible biography of General Pickett see Edward G. Longacre's "Leader of the Charge."
__label__2 Best Hip-Hop CD of the 90's. Period.: I've been listening to Slug and Ant (the rapper and producer who make up Atmosphere) ever since Overcast! came out in '97. Personally, i think this is the best hip-hop cd of the ninties. Slug's rhymes are so smart, personal, and most importantly, real. The tracks that make this the best album are, If I Was Santa Claus, Dont Ever F***ing Question That, Free or Dead, Like Today, and a great live song, It Goes. I can't wait till Seven's Travels comes out in September.
__label__2 Husband loved it!: This was a gift for my husband; he loved it. Seller delivered in a timely manner. Very pleased.
__label__1 I don't even know where to start: There is so much wrong with this book I don't even know where to start. She's handing out ridiculous "disinformation" about every subject under the sun. I liked her book Sun Signs. Love Signs was sappy and terribly overwritten. This one is sappy, terribly overwritten, and just... insane. It makes no intrinsic sense. In some cases I think her dietary advice is actually dangerous. I really think she had gone around the bend when she wrote this, and from the other reviews I see here it sounds like some of her followers went with her.
__label__1 So not worth it: Subscription service assistants for this magazine are pathetic. I paid for my subscription when I submitted my order, yet they suspended my account while "waiting for payment". They have yet to deliver my first issue, and I'm sure I won't even need it by then. There are better magazines out there, and this one isn't one of them. I recommend saving your time and money and avoiding Shape's FitPregnancy.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Money: If you're expecting a book that's half as insightful as Jerry Lawler's or Mick Foley's, look somewhere else. The author was a minor player in a second rate organization. The "behind the scenes" stories are weak and give you no new insight into the interesting people that made up the world of Professional Wrestling at the time. I've read many wrestling books and biographies and would recommend Mick Foley, Jerry Lawler and especially Pure Dynamite by Tom Billington. If someone gives you this book, give it back.
__label__1 Children Deserve Quality Entertainment: And this is not. This movie is completely ripping off Pixar's "Cars". Do your children a favor: they don't have the freedom yet to choose quality over dreck, nutrition over junkfood. Sit down and watch Pixar's "Cars" with them instead of buying this cheap imitation; you might find yourself entertained as well.
__label__1 Boogie Nights This film would not play.: We tried it on all three of our DVD players and it would not play. I responded to this before but nothing was done about it. I would not order from this vendor again.
__label__2 Love Yourself again and again: As a yoga teacher I'm always looking for inspirational music. I've put this album in my alarm clock - I wake up every morning with the affirmation "Love Yourself". The lyrics of Love Yourself, and the other songs on the album, are deeply inspirational and positive. A nourshing diet for the mind, with melodys that make it stick to the ribs.
__label__1 No re-read value as an adult sadly: This is a mini review for the original print of this book. For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book blog listed in my profile...I seemed to remember these being more ghostly in nature, and not so brief. A great read for children - it WILL spook them. But probably not a good read or reread for adults. It was nice to revisit some of the stories from my childhood, but I will look elsewhere for classic ghost stories. I do remember them being a lot better then they were.
__label__1 POSERS: This band sucks hard core,all of their albums suck.This album has Into The Moonlight which is a good song I guess and then the song The Book Of Heavy Metal which is good but something this band shouldn't write about because everyone in this band looks like posers besides Gus G.The singer blows,he is very annoying(poser)everyone in this band is a poser.I can't believe how much this album sucks!This band is very cheesy.They are more traditional metal then power metal.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
__label__2 Heart Mind and Soul CD review: Good listening cd, one of my favorites. I would recommend to a friend. <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
__label__1 bad sale: Did not see enough info that this video can only be viewed in other areas other than the U.S.. Very disappointed and will not purchase another dvd from amazon!!
__label__1 Bug Report: I have bought sony microvault (USM64U2) one months before from a sony showroom. But after a month this device is recognized as security device. I just astonished why sony has not admitted their fault.
__label__1 a romance novel: River God is not a historical fiction novel. It is romance pulp that just happens to have the setting of ancient Egypt. The story revealed nothing about life in ancient Egypt. The neutered main character is completely unbelievable with how he is a 'master of ALL trades'. I regret wasting my time on this book.
__label__2 A little heavy: Overall I am pleased with the monopod. Very sturdy and well made although it is a mite on the heavy side. It does double very wall as a walking stick and has gone on several wanders with me already.
__label__1 Never again will I order from this company!: I still have yet to recieve my item! I had an order of several different items ordered at the same time. And recieved all of the other items weeks ago! I am very dissapointed and upset! I have never had this issue before. Lesson Learned!!
__label__1 Disappointing and a little convuluted.: This was a book that didn't keep me involved as I read it. I like a book that is hard for me to put down and this wasn't it.
__label__2 my favorite film: i've been a passionate film buff for thirty + years (even attended film school for two years), and this is my favorite movie i've ever seen. it boats a literate, passionate, challenging, entertaining and poignant script with something new and definitive to say about love - not hollywood love, but the amorphous concept of love in everyday life. its filmmaking is imaginative, disciplined, and shimmering with creativity. the lead (and some supporting) actors give the best performances of their careers. and in the end, as high minded as the concept is, you walk away feeling you've seen something more grounded in real human condition than most so-called dramas. there's been nothing like this film in our lifetime. it absolutely supports the idea of cinema as art and not just entertainment.
__label__2 Some good listening: I started listening to Mana about 4 years ago. The first song that I heard from them was "como dueles en los labios". After findnig out who the band was, I searched for that song and ran into "Donde Jugaran Los Ninos." The album was excellent and I have bought every album since. I have not tired of any of their songs. I highly recommend this and any of their albums. As for the person who posted from Peru, I think it's a little unfair to call their music garbage(basura). If you know about Mana, then you know Peru was big in Mana's rise. Thanks for that. Aside from that, what band has come out of Peru that has been a hit in the U.S.? As for the music being just for (gringos), I'm a chicano and most of the people I know that listen to them are Mexican, or chicano. It's nice to know there are American's that do listen to it. Good for our white friends for expanding their taste in music. Unfortunately our friend from Peru is shallow.
__label__1 28 Days comes up short...: First off I'd like to say that I'm a very big fan of Sandra Bullock. Her quirky nature and cute antics usually brings life into a movie. HOWEVER, 28 Days was absolutely terrible. It's a shame that Sandra couldn't turn this movie around, but it's not her fault. The plot is lacking, and full of holes, and the characters in the film have absolutely no depth. The movie had very few comical scenes, and the dramatic sequences were drawn out. This movie is very predictable, a 5 year old can figure this out. If you don't believe me, go rent the movie, and when you try to figure out why you wasted 2 hours of your life on this lackadaisical film, you can e-mail me and tell me that I was right. 1 star for this movie, and if there was no Sandra Bullock, this movie wouldn't even get 1/2 a star.
__label__1 WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - Cheaply made: I would not recommend buying this product. After using one on 3 ears of corn, it fell apart. I thought maybe it was just that one, so I tried another cutter(I had ordered 4 of them) and that too fell apart after using on only 2 ears of corn. It was a big disappointment. This product is cheaply made.
__label__2 Well-written, comprehensive, needs more example questions.: This book doesn't have any of the signs of being rushed out to be the first on the shelf (although it does have its share of mistakes). Screen-shots are spread throught the book, making it easy to follow examples with practice sitting at the computer. The book begins each topic from quite a basic standpoint (although some basic knowledge prior to beginning this book would be a definite advantage). Some areas of the exam syllabus aren't sufficiently covered (e.g. deployment, testing and Visual Source Safe), but others easily make up for this lack (e.g. ActiveX controls are covered very well). Example questions are generally too short, and it's a pity that more advantage wasn't taken of the enclosed CD (the questions in the book and on the CD are exactly the same)
__label__1 Dancer from LA: I really did not like this CD at all. Don't buy this CD if you are a beginning Belly Dancer. Very hard to dance to unless you are an advanced dancer. The drum beat in the first two songs was so abnoxious it nearly gave me a headache. I bought it, put it in my player and listened to the six songs hoping to find at least one that was enjoyable but didn't. Took it out and put it up for sale. There are a lot better CD's out there for the money, and with more than 6 songs on it.
__label__2 C.Thomas Howell is the best!: C.Thomas Howell is always going to be mt favorite actor! I am his biggest fan yet...and I am pretty sure I always will be! I havent yet seen this movie...and I am suprised because it is the only movie of Tommy's that I havent seen. All of his other movies are excellent (2 thumbs up! lol*) Well I always will have a special place for tom in my heart and I hope he writes to me one day.....because he is my inspiration and role-model! Thanks Tom you are the best! I know this movie will rock cause I am getting it for X-mas!
__label__1 Not what i expected.: The directions did not come on paper with this product. They are written in silver on back of watch and were impossible to read. We had to purchase a magnifying glass to read it. The alarm is not loud enough and tends to go off at times other than is set. The watch has also stopped a couple of times. It has been a disappointing purchase.
__label__2 great shoes: well made shoes, very lightweight. My son loves them. scuff easily, but can also often be unscuffed by gently cleaning. My son is small and grows slowly, so he has been wearing them for since late fall and winter and even spring seasons!! They still look pretty good. But he doesn't wear them to school or out in muddy backyard...
__label__1 To bake, or not to bake, that is the question...: Honestly, I found this textbook to be hard to follow, difficult to understand, and many of the recipes and formulas did not work. Also, there were not many photos, and the diagrams were confusing. This certainly is not for the home chef, and I hesitate to recommend this to professional students either.
__label__1 Today, Tomorrow, Forever - A Really Bad Product: Save your ears and your money. This is such a very bad recording that Elvis is often unrecognizeable. The producers have scraped the bottom of the barrel to come up with recordings of Elvis not fit for human consumption ... then or now.
__label__1 After 2 I give up: I'm attempting to put a dent in the ratings and persuade others not to buy this product. I've had 2 of these, replaced the initial one a year ago after talking to Linksys and determining that it had malfunctioned. I purchased a D-link EBR-2310 a month ago and after installing it (5 minutes) I haven't touched it. The second Linksys I had to reboot every few days, sometimes twice a day. My fastest internet speed tests were plus 10Mb, and after a day or so my bandwidth would degrade and come to a crawl (300Kb). It was so frustrating.The Linksys wave has crashed, get on a different one. I've gone through 2 Access Points, 2 Range Extenders and now 2 Routers by Linksys. I'm fed up with their products.
__label__2 Great stories of a city kids everyday life: This CD is full of smart lyrics and great beats. If you liked the single "What It's Like you will love the rest of everlast's album. Not only is this a great album but is full of compelling stories that are far removed from songs with lyrics that are hard to understand period and have no real affect on the listeners. This CD will make you think about how fortunate you to not to have to go through that on a day to day basis.
__label__2 Sounder: I like this book becase the author explains everthing.I was angry when they took.The boys dad to jail.The author used alot of details to make me feel sorry for them.The boy had to drop out of school to help his parents.The author makes it the book very relistec.It was interesting that the dog was the only one with a name.The author did a wonderful job of making us hate the villins.This book is the best.I ever read.
__label__1 Chemistry : Concepts & Applications: If this book were for me, I would gladly review it but I bought it for a friend who plans to take the appropriate tests for becoming a science teacher in high school. I have rated it at one star because I know very little about the book contents and the review will not go through unless I do a rating! Maybe someone needs to add "Don't know" as a category.
__label__1 Good while it lasted: Like other reviewers, I had a good experience with the portable Soleus 40-Pint dehumidifier...while it worked. I received it in September 2007, and it had quit working by the end of summer 2009. The motor/fan continued to run, but it completely ceased removing water from the air. Back when it was running correctly, it was reasonably quiet and effective, and I liked its relative portability. I never had trouble with it overflowing, although it was common to slosh some water out of the bucket while emptying it. Since I don't enjoy trying to figure out how to properly recycle such bulky items, I won't be buying another one.
__label__2 Eastbound @ Down Season One: I watched the complete first season of this show in a marathon session, considering you can watch the season in under three hours. Danny McBride as Kenny Powers is funny and does make a great lead character. However, I really didnt laugh too much. Probably because i've seen so much of this humor that it's hard to stay fresh and come up with something really funny. Will Ferrell as car dealer, Ashely Schaffer, was funny and really stole the two shows he appeared in. When I watched the final show, I wanted more and cannot wait for season two and see what happens to Powers. A must have for comedy lovers.
__label__1 buy this if you like to be miserable: After less than one year of owning this binder, which I had filled to capacity, the binding broke. Shortly after, the carrying strap broke. I've noticed my discs getting more scratched during the past year than I'd noticed with other cd binders. I've still had this thing for almost two years and I don't know why. Getting cd's in and out is really difficult and I seriously feel like it is damaging my discs. I'm treating myself to a new binder tomorrow. I've noticed CaseLogic getting good reviews.
__label__2 Roy D Heck Raising Butt Whuppin Mercer: Heres another good album by Roy D Mercer. My favorite phone prank off of this one is when a truck blew its horn and caused Sharon Gene to ruin a rented Santa Claus suit. Another one involves him losing nude pictures of Sharon gene in a cab. You should get this.
__label__1 Don't even think about printing photos on this thing!: This printer is awful for printing photos! The reddish/pinkish tone to the photos is overwhelming. If you go in to the color controls and lower the amount of magenta ink used, then the other colors look distorted. Also, on most photo settings, where there is black on your photo, it turns out looking cracked or spotty. The ink is of very poor quality, and I always buy my replacement cartridges from Epson, using the correct numbers. A total waste of money, unless you only need it for scanning and printing documents.
__label__2 Battery Tender Jr.: Great product, very convenient quick connect pigtail that stays attached to the battery. My battery was completely drained and the battery tender brought it up to full overnight. I have not had any issues since. I love the way the unit has an automatic shutoff and if the battery starts to show low levels again the tender will turn back on. It's a no maintenance tool that you can keep on all winter. I'm happy that my friends at [...] turned me onto this product, it certainly has saved me a lot of time and money.
__label__1 Boo!: So, I bought this Nintendo DS Safe Case by Intec. Unfortunately, it held only three games. So I'm thinking either A.L.S. NDS-15 Case or this one. I don't really trust this company because it is not licensed by Nintendo, but A.L.S. is. I don't think my case is going to last that long. The side of this is the same as one I has. When those little bumps get pushed in, they don't look good. Plus, this is more expensive than NDS 15! NDS 15 is like a bag. Or you might like NDS 14. There is 1% chance of getting this and 99% of getting NDS 15. And that Pro Gamer's Kit sucks!!!!!
__label__1 Good music, miserable CD: I love this music and was looking forward to owning my own copy. It was a real shock to hear the poor quality of the recording and mixing on the album. I can't wait to get rid of my copy.
__label__1 Reality: Typical Velvet Revolver album. One great rock song, one mediocre ballad and the rest is repetitive trash.
__label__2 Love this book: How much do I love this book? (1) My edition is 24 years old, it is dog-eared from reading and rereading (2) it is so beautifully written that when I am alone I will put it off the shelves and read passages out loud. (3) I gave the book as gifts to younger relatives as they grow up. That tradition ended a few years ago when the book foolishly went out of print. Very disheartening. Glad it is back, so many reviewers love it like I do and the rest of you can have it too. It is a warm, knowlegeable, very human, mystical, beautiful book.
__label__1 Poor construction and waste of money!: Won't stay up, Have no idea why they would design legs that would extend and not stay up. I could do better holding my camera on my knee. Don't waist time on this one. Get an old sears catalog to sit your camera on...
__label__2 Great filter.: I work in the tropics 4 months out of the year; we drink river water because the site is secluded. This filter is a life saver; I wish I purchased it sooner. I love it. The water tastes great, the amount of water filtered can last for days, and you don't have to pump or put in chlorine tablets. The only disadvantage: pouring water in can be a challenge if you are by yourself, but I've managed to do it anyway. Overall I think it is worth every penny.
__label__1 Nothing but trouble.: This card stinks. No words can describe how much fustration the lack of good drivers...[It'll take] aloot of pain to buy the half functional sound card.
__label__2 Not a single lawyer in the whole book.: This novel is very different from the usual Grisham lawyer novel but still an excellent read. The story is about growing up on a cotton farm in Arkansas in the early 50s, as seen from a seven year old boy's perspective. There is the struggle of farming cotton and some exciting secrets that keep the story going and interest high.
__label__2 Real bible: It is one of the best cook's books ever. I have tried nearly all the recepies and all the soups were wery tasty. What I specially like about it is that the author goes with her recepies all over the world. All the recepies are very authentic to their home country and with preparing the food according to them you can make small journeys from Thailand over the Russia to France ... .
__label__1 well, I knew it: Did you expect something better? 6doit had already shown what some of the old DT fans knew: magic is over. JP and MP just fill everything with disgusting extremely fast things. Do never again expect nice melodic (and virutous too, that was magic) unisons, or good lyrics. The only comments can be now of the sort: "wow, how fast". But never again, not even with SFAM, which I found to be some sort of insult for that master piece that was Metroplolis 1 will I expect to be touched musically (melody, harmony, even virtuosism) and lirically. Does DT belong to Portnoy? I liked him but began to find him ever more irritating each time I saw that he pretended to do everything: songwriting, singing, producing. It's obvious what KM foresaw.
__label__2 Great book: We used this book in my fifth grade classroom as a writing activity. After reading the book, students selected their "best part" and wrote an essay about it. Cute concept.
__label__1 Tedious: This has to be hands down one of the most boring storylines the so called script writers in Hollywood have ever dreamed up. I thought he was going to become the size of King Kong and go on a rampage destroying buildings and stamping on people with his feet. Instead he just put on a bit of weight then lost it again. Boring. I'm suprised the good people of McDonalds put their name to this - if anything they came out of it looking bad.
__label__1 Dissenting view: Well, I disagree with most of these reviews. I own all of Ms Krall's cds and this is, I believe, her poorest. Her voice is so coarse and so often off key in these arrangements that I felt compelled to listen carefully to a couple of her early cds as a reality test. The same vocal issues are there too in the beginning, but just a little bit. Her voice has changed to my ear, and not for the better. And that little bit in the earlier cds is covered up by her solid, swinging piano, which clearly gets her into the music--her brio carries the day. Not here. A real disappointment.
__label__2 A solid band: I found a lot of cool sounds on this CD. I read the other reviews and decided to write one myself after someone trashed this band. I think that review was kind of meaan, because Livingston Bramble is talented, but if the reviewer didn't like the songs, well, ok. Each track has it's own groove, and I think this group has a very unique sound. No, they are not the Creed or Tool or the greatest band in the hemisphere. But hey are a good band in my opinion. I plan on buying their new CD, too, which I guess is the best compliment I can give. I saw them live last weekend and they were excellent compared to a lot of the bands I have seen. I agree that the CD is not perfect but this is a good starting point for any new band. Four stars outta 5.
__label__2 Generally great: This bag has been overall exactly what I expected. Larger than my old bag, but not overwhelming. Lots of pockets for organizing and an easy access laptop compartment. Overall at great product. Only downside is that one of the straps was a little bit torn when I got it. I think it will be fine, and I might patch it later, but it looks a bit like a weed whacker got a little too close to the side edge of one of the straps...
__label__1 What????????????: I am flabbergasted at some of the reviews here of this album. Folks this album is not just the worst album of Elton John's career, it almost single-handedly destroyed his career and any music credibility he had. To this day it has tarnished what was otherwise an impressive catalog from the 1970's.Avoid this album people. Avoid at all costs. Do not even frequent stores that keep it in stock, and sever friendships with anyone who owns it. It is an album like this that makes one question humanity.
__label__1 Poor service: I still have not received the item ordered. It has been a month since it was ordered. Is there any way to cancel this order and start again with a new vendor?
__label__1 What a DUST BLOWER!: No Bags. Whoopie! Filters cost more than the bags would. Dust just POURS out of this machine. Constant Maintenance on this vacuum! Yuck! I wish I had the Hepa Bagged Version instead. What an Unimprovement!!!
__label__2 Heart pounding action: The action grips you so you can't put these books down. My one concern is over the fact that I read these as recommended for ages 14 and up. I would never give these to my 14 year old and am not ready to hand them over to my 16 year old. However I highly recommend them as long as you know of their sexual content. Sookie is a wonderful main character and I will continue with this series as long as they are written. I have never read this type of book before and took opportunities to find a quiet place in which to read.
__label__2 handy tire inflator: This is a compact, convenient, versatile air compressor that will help me keep my tire pressures as they should be.
__label__1 Great looks but...: Extremely strong and looks really good, BUT.....The threading on both the main punch and the additional bits holes and bits are really stiff requiring careful use of a wrench to remove and put in. Possibility of cross threading high.I wanted it for leather punching, but it just doesn't do the job despite the heavy materials and good looks. I have yet to get any of the bits to actually punch a complete clean hole. Not sure if it is bit sharpness that is lacking or????VERY disappointing!!!
__label__1 "The Carpenters on valium" says it all: Di Liberto's quip sums this up. I defy anyone to tell one Enya CD from another, and this is no exception. That said, regurgitating the same set of reverb certainly buys you a nice castle south of Dublin. Living next door to Bono hasn't done anything for her sense of adventure musically, but she knows what her public will swallow gladly.The pretentiousness of "inventing" a "language" speaks for itself. In fact, spills out volumes. Perhaps she'll have a tryst with Jon Anderson and the world will implode with the arrival of their demon child. In the meantime, I'd like to think the world has moved beyond this treacle. Not so....
__label__2 Aerosole Cinch: Great shoes, extremely comfortable. Just the right height and loads of compliments from everyone! I own 4 pairs now, and wear them almost daily.
__label__1 I will NEVER buy a blu-ray with UltraViolet Digital Copy: This is a power grab by short-sighted studios and I will not indulge them with my business. No matter how much I may like a particular film, I will not spend money on any movie that ships with UltraViolet. And I am not just going to let them move my money around - I will also not buy this movie in any digital format or from Amazon.co.uk. This needs to stop.
__label__1 AWFUL unless you are doing attachment pareting: This was used during my first child, unless you are doing attachment style parenting then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!! It tells you to carry your baby in a sling 24/7 and to sleep with the baby in your bed - not alwasys safe!! It also makes you feel like crap if you don't breast feed which I did but it is NOT a good book at all!!
__label__2 Smooth And Relaxing: The sounds of Grover Washington's saxaphone are indeed very soothing. The special effects from the synthesizers and the precussion merely add to the songs rather than over color them as other artists sometimes do. The themes on each of the songs are quite memorable. Caught A Touch Of Your Love is probably the most memorable piece on this collection as BB King delivers some fine vocals and guitar licks in between Grover's tender saxophone sounds. The Look Of Love, Monte Carlo Nights, and The Title Track also are very memorable mostly due to the balance between the instruments. The bass lines on Monte Carlo Nights are just pulsating. Anyway, its hard to beleive that I am the first one reviewing this recording because this collection defintiely needs to be bought!
__label__2 Yes, you CAN grieve for a long time: There is one plot device here that some readers question: whether someone can grieve for a loved one for a decade. I did, so I know that it is possible. Therefore, this book makes emotional and psychological sense to me in that respect. However, when the hero doesn't seem to recall the heroine after all these years...that does NOT make sense. Otherwise, this is a good read, with an alpha hero who is trying - but not succeeding - in becoming a gamma hero. Anne Stuart is currently famous for her gammas. If you prefer a somewhat more redeemable man, her earlier works are preferable (actually, I love all her books).
__label__1 What is this?: I don't understand. One would have to laugh to keep from crying over what is supposed to be a tribute to the late Aaliayh Haughton. This album was thrown together with absolutely no effort at all. I would tell the creators of this CD to put the FisherPrice keyboard back up on the shelf.
__label__1 In Search of More Poetic Prose in a Thriller: I am an author and I love thrillers. My biggest disappointment in today's world of adventure fiction is the inability to find a mesmerizing adventure constructed with poetic and living prose which allows me to feel the southern Louisiana heat, smell the toasted bagels in a Manhattan deli or wince along with the facial expressions of a lawyer caught ambulance chasing in the hospital room of a critically injured patient. While a better yarner than Turow, this author's works lack the sort of living color which fiction demands. I recently discovered an author who accomplishes this and a thriller in which he does it. The author is Gary Wickert, and the book is DARK REDEMPTION. I didn't find it yet on Barnes & Noble, but it has just been released and it is available on Amazon.com. If you like this author's storylines, but want to be riveted to and made love to by the prose which are the building blocks of any piece of fiction....READ 'DARK REDEMPTION'.
__label__1 Extremely disappointed...: I have been planning a "backyard" water park for my sons 5th birthday. We were so excited to find this "bubble blowing sprinkler". However, when we opened up the box and set it up, we were extremely disappointed. Our water pressure is very good so that's not the problem. We hooked the sprinkler up and the water only goes about 3 1/2 feet high. And the bubbles? What bubbles? You get about 1 to 2 inch bubbles that barely make it out of the "machine" and float right down to the grass. They do supply you with 2 small bottles of bubbles, however, each bottle lasts between 5 and 8 minutes. And don't you dare get any water into the bubble reservoir, although since it's a water sprinkler also, this is unavoidable and impossible. Please, don't waste your money. My son and I are both extremely disappointed.
__label__2 This is PHAT!!: I really like the Cd a lot it has some hot songs on there..I just wish that they got picked up by a MCA so that they can get the press they deserve......
__label__1 Drivel...: Read this rather long dissection of this distorted thesis. It's even more remarkable that there are those that would agree with her.homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/coulter.pdf
__label__2 Cozy comfort, warmth and practical: Ordered these for my husband for Christmas. Don't think he has taken them off since. The fit was accurate to his size (14), and comfort great. I especially like the sturdy sole as he likes to wear his slippers out on our patio or out to get the mail and the concrete has been rough on other slippers he has previously worn. Both he and I are pleased with the slippers and the delivery was as promised.
__label__1 Not so Satisfied: The sender didn't send the item. According to the sender, he/she found out that the item was damaged upon preparing it for shipment. He/she said it was his/her last refill. I would think the sender didn't remove the item promptly from the list after he/she ran out of it.
__label__2 Mom2: My kids ( ages 18 months n 4 1/2) love this video. They watch it countless time n it's k because its teaching them biblical n life lessons.
__label__1 Think twice about a cape style: This style appealed to me because it's different from a sweater and I thought it would be especially warm. I didn't think it through, because the cape style limits movement. It's probably fine for a sedate walk, but if there's running or playing involved, stick with something that has sleeves.I thought the inside would be fleece and it's actually a quilted nylon, a lot less warm and a bit slippery too, since there's nothing to keep it centered on the dog's back--it keeps sliding sideways.Also, this ran a bit larger than other XS items I've bought.
__label__1 Faulty Product: Bed sprung a leak after less then 3 weeks of use, pulling apart at the seams around the indentations on the top. I patched the two holes I could find but it continues to deflate. Coleman is refusing to honor the warranty and replace it, claiming that the item is out of stock.
__label__2 Best reading of the Choral Fantasy I've yet heard: No performance is perfect, and as with other classical pieces, I have multiple recordings of any one work. Sometimes almost all performance qualities are excellent, but usually one factor might be a little weak. I first heard this recording while driving, and even accounting for the car phenomenon that seems to make many performances more involving, this one excels at most everything. The Serkins interpret this wonderfully, and the voices are euphonious. As I react differently each time I hear any work, I hope hearing the live audience reacting the same way every time doesn't bother me.
__label__2 Entrancing lovely prose and an all too true scenario: With respect to those who don't believe that Foster Homes can be that bad, They Can. I worked in the system for several years. I had to get out because I felt so depressed about the poor options kids have in this kind of situation. There are lots of wonderful pages in this book though. It gives hope to read about a girl who could go through the things in this story and survive. I thought the writing could have been tighter and some of the chapters felt like they were filler. But when I got to the end of the book I felt bereft. I need to know how this girl turns out in a few more years. I hope she makes it all the way to actual happiness. I wonder how some of the kids I worked with did.
__label__1 Not great...: My 10 year old son got this for his birthday. The screws are so deep inside the ball, we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out. (The ball won't bounce anyway!) Even then, the screws would not come out! The lightup goal is great, but the ball is ridiculous. Use your old nerf balls and then it's okay.
__label__2 A book that will change mathematics teaching/learning.: This book provides a starting place for an important and long overdue discussion. Teachers, mathematicians and preservice programs could come together to develop professional development programs around this one book. Understanding our own misunderstandings in mathematics will help to change instructional practice. Every school should have at least one copy.
__label__1 never received: Didn't understand why a product would still be on your web site for availability when product was already sold.
__label__1 The Sword and the Dragon: The movie is great. The quality of the tape is very bad. I am not satisfied with that.
__label__1 Water wiggler replacement: The preceision water wiggler I purchased quit woeking after about 80 days. I called the company that produced it and they were very helpfuland said they would replace it. I sent the defective one back but haven't received the replacement yet. I'm sure it will come soon. It worked perfectly when it was operating. Thanks Stan Moffitt
__label__1 Slow, tedious, and ultimately boring...: This review is going to be short, to save us all some time. This film is not horrible, it has a couple (and I do mean two) good scares. BUT, the overall movie itself is terribly slow. You keep waiting for some kind of shock or revelation, but it never comes. Even the end, when you'd at least expect the tediousness of it all to pay off, it doesn't. Avoid this one. There are plenty of other good horror movies out there.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...
__label__1 Poor quality: I love the Muppets. And I love puzzles. Whereas this Muppets Collage Puzzle should have been ideal, I found it lacking in quality. The photo was slightly blurred. The pieces did not lock together well. All things considered, this product is not worth your money.
__label__1 horrible product: this stick will have a unresponsive triangle button within your first month of playing so good luck with this i don't advise it to anyone ... if your not going to get a TE stick don't buy one at all!
__label__1 Great while it lasts: I purchased this item specifically for its claims of long-lasting light off a single pair of D batteries. My most recent experience is that the advertised battery life of 80 hours for the 5 LED setting was reduced to about 5 hours in ~15 Deg F temperatures. I got the light for use in overnight trail running where I didn't want to have to carry spare batteries, and was nearly left out in the dark. I've heard other complaints about the 3-way switches giving out, so that may be what's wrong as well. I'm hoping to be able to return it.On the plus side, it does make a nice amount of light, although I don't really see any difference between the 10 LED's and 1 xenon bulb to be honest.
__label__2 Intriguing: Unlike the other review I found this episode very intriguing and plays on an earlier episode where Worf was romantically involved with Troi.
__label__2 great taste: this is a very good product. When it is mixed with milk and coffee it is even better! I recommend it
__label__1 Awful Sandals: They will not last forever (probably only a year or so and of that year you'll spend several weeks with sore feet trying to break them in) and the customer service is horendous (have a list of exclusions which covers just about everything and if not, they will make an exclusion up when they reject your warranty claim).
__label__1 NOT for bread slicing: This might be a great meat or cheese slicer, but if you make real homemade bread with a good crust the bread won`t bend easy enough to go passed the blade. On the other side of the blade they have a rounded contraption that hides the motor, so the bread has to bend a lot when going through. Unless you make american air bread thats soft and soggy, it won`t go through.
__label__1 Pretty much un-readable: Although there are a few good nuggets in this book I found it practically unreadable.First, the lack of visuals. There are a few figures in the book but they are hand drawn and not very informative. That means you've got to understand everything from the text. Why not use photographs liberally to SHOW what you mean rather than just describe it.Contrast this book with Harold Harb's new book "Anyone can be an expert skier", or Warren Witherall's "The Athletic Skier" and you'll know what I mean.Second, and this might be trivial to a lot of people, but I thought the font was horrible. Why use a helvitica font when you could use a times roman font? It is MUCH harder to read. The pages have no white-space.So, bottom line, I would NOT recommend this to someone looking for that proverbial breakthrough. It is a nice supplemant to other books such as Harb's and Witherall's books on skiing.
__label__2 My niece loves him: Bought this as a gift for my niece who loves bow wow very much. I would recommend to those who like this type of music.
__label__1 as enjoyable as a toothache: This sequel to the disney movie "Kid in King Arthur's Castle" is as pointless a sequel as Son of the mask. This is really a disney ripoff. The lamp looks the same as Disney's aladdin. The part that gets me confused. If the lamp vanished like 80,000 years ago. How would it end up in a pizza place. Don't waste your money on this stupid movie.
__label__1 Yikes!: I really do love Anne McCaffrey's writing and the stories in this book are great. What I didn't like is that it's a collaboration of short stories, but nowhere on the cover does it tell you it's going to be that way! I honestly thought it was all about a fantasy story about a "girl who heard dragons." I am heavily dissappointed. But, I still love Anne:)
__label__2 Orion is Among the Stars: I also have only read one volume, but the ideas therein are so societally under-represented. The articles are controversial, sometimes satirical, and very educational. Orion is a welcome addition to any deep-thinker's coffee table.
__label__1 Got wrong cable!: Bought this for a Palm TX... unpackaged in a hurry for a trip and threw the cable in my bag... ONLY to find out on the trip that they sent the wrong cable. Not happy!
__label__2 AWESOME CD DUDES!: WAY COOL SOUNDTRACK FROM A TOTALLY WACKED OUT MOVIE! NEW FOO FIGHTERS, OFFSPRING, CAKE AND THE LEGENDARY BRIAN WILSON SINGING TWO TRACKS! LOVE AND MERCY MIGHT BECOME A BIGGER HIT AGAIN! JUST POP THIS ONE IN THE CD PLAYER AND BLAST IT WITH THE TOP DOWN OR SUNROOF OPEN WHILE CRUSIN DOWN THE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY! BUY IT NOW!
__label__2 Great presentation tool: Gives me mobility necessary to be a dynamic presenter. Changes slides, laser points, and allows me to blank the slide. Occasionally does not respond to first button click though
__label__2 A new edition of ENTERING THE STREAM: This is one of the best introductions to Buddhism available. The book begins with the life of the Buddha and then gives his basic teachings. The following chapters give an overview of the various schools and philosophies from a practice point of view. The chapters are written by great masters and practitioners of the various sects. If you could only have one text on Buddhism, this would be your best choice. For more reviews see the entry for the previous edition entitled ENTERING THE STREAM: An Introduction to the Buddha and His Teachings.
__label__1 Doesnt work: Does not work with Windows XP service pack 2, it needs a WIA driver that is not yet available. It is also incompatible with most other imaging devises, meaning if you have a piece of hardware like a card reader for your camera you will need to uninstall it before it will work in most other windows environments. Went through all the support channels and even was sent a different unit because they claimed it was a hardware problem and wound up sending that one back because it wasn't the problem. So here I sit with a big white elephant on my desk.
__label__1 Great Book So far: So far, this is a really great read! I don't know how I missed this years ago.. I read ALOT! But I agree with the person above's comment, that I found it easy to put the book down fom a while. I got a little bored with Ralph Ellison's overly descriptive imagination. I almost felt like he was what I a "PAGE FILLER" Just trying to make the book longer. I think this book is taking me the longest it ever has to read a book because of that one thing... But after I skipped a few pages (I don't usually do that.. but I just couldn't take it anymore) I got right back into it.. I let you know what I think once I finish....
__label__2 Madagascar 3: My family always loves the Madagascar films and this was no exception. This had some slow parts and id agree that is isnt as good as number 1 but we would all watch this movie again and again. Love the characters and the new additions.
__label__1 Cheap: Had these for three days. I went to unplug my headphones and the inside came out. Going to buy more else where. You get what you pay for.
__label__2 Zojirushi bread machine: This bread machine is great. I have wheat allergies and usually make my own bread. This bread machine makes a beautiful, high, tasteful bread. A huge improvement over my old machine.
__label__1 Was Only Used For 3 Months: My 21-month-old son did not get much use of it. We wanted an outdoor structure where he could play on and we didn't have to constantly stand guard so he wouldn't fall. We thought this was the ideal toy for him because of it's size, but we were wrong. My son has fallen down a few times from the small platform and has hit his head numerous times on the top of the plastic walls. The doorway arch is too low, as well the archway for the slide. The platform itself is too low, so children cannot really crawl underneath to play in it. After a few months of this toy outside all by it's lonesome, we decided to sell and it get something bigger.
__label__2 Great Product: I bought it basically for our Cat..... It drives her NUTS! We call it "THE BUG"....and she responds to it every time we mention its name.I also purchase it because of the batteries,.much better the the watch ones.....I would of gave it 5 stars but it DIDN'T COME WITH BATTERIES!! Overall its a excellent product........THE BUG (:
__label__2 Entrapment was wonderful!: I just saw Entrapment last night. It was extrmelly fun to watch. Connery and Zeta-Jones work very well togtether. Get ready for a surprise ending.
__label__1 Very Disappointing: We've been patiently awaiting this latest Warner Brothers release only to find that it isn't a new feature-length film like Zombie Island or Witch's Ghost at all. It is yet another feeble attempt to rehash forgotten Scooby "misses" from long ago. With only Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy-Doo (yuck!), this is the most disappointing "new" Scooby Doo release yet. Not only is the story-line predictable and disconnected, but the entire movie is TOO LONG. The jokes are unfunny and most of the lines are cliche. My three year old loves Scooby Doo, but even he is bored with this one.
__label__2 A brilliant recital!: La Divina means "The divine one"!! The greatest title ever given to a soprano. And only Callas deserved it! An amazing recital from beginning to the end. My first Callas-CD, I made an excellent choice!
__label__1 Not made in USA. Hecho en Mexico.: I bought these bowls because other reviewers received dishes that were made in the USA. All of the items I received (I ordered bowls and plates) were from a company called Crisa and were labeled "Hecho en Mexico." I tried to call the company to ask about the lead issue but could not find a web site. It looks like Crisa is now a division of Libbey. I called Libbey several times but got a recording that then disconnects you. Disappointing. Will be returning.
__label__2 More Complicated than MvsC2: This is a game for people who like to incorporate strategy into their fights. If you have Xbox live do not buy this on PS2, get it on Xbox so you can play it online. I personaly prefer Guilty Gear X2 over this anyday.
__label__2 David Hyde Pierce at his best: I hadnt even heard of this movie and stumbled upon it via Amazon Prime, was thrown for a loop when i ended up enjoying the entire movie. Even if youre not a big fan of DHP it will grab you with all the twist and turns.
__label__2 Moody does it again!: One of America's primere preachers, Jess Moody, whose prolific pen poured out "A Drink At Joel's Place" is flowing again. This time with pointed,poignant and preachable prose. His best loved stories will touch your heart,tickle your imagination, and titilate your sermonic sensibilities. This book is a must have for the preacher, teacher, or christian speaker. As usual, Moody, the master wordsmith, spins spritually insightful and powerfully applicable stories form personal encounters of a half century of ministry. This is vintage Moody. If you thought "A Drink At Joel's Place" was heady you will want to guzzle this new offering.
__label__1 Fans run, temp doesn't cool: This fans certainly blow air on my MacBook Pro, but the CPU and other temps don't decrease and the MBP's fans don't slow at all. Leaving the notebook open without the Antec beneath while and external monitor is attached is a much better solution.
__label__2 A great Mature Anime: This Anime is not for the fan who are not ready for Bloody, Violent, and Mature situation. I personally love this anime. There are a lot of sex related jokes that you will think go too far, But will be laughing so hard that you wouldn't care until after the fact. The dubbing company is fairly new and unheard of, But they did a really good job with this one. Only real complaint I had with there dubbing job was that they added a lot of not really needed swearing. If you are into Mature animes, you will love this one. If you aren't, I would recommend something more like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. I hope this helps.
__label__1 VERY DISAPPOINTED . . .: Even though my computer had MUCH MORE than the minimum requirements to run this program, we never could get it to operate. The product repeatedly locked up right after you selected the body shape. The music still played, and you could select a different body shape, but it would not let you move to the next level.
__label__1 Do not waste your money: I picked these up at a local pet store thinking that the design might make them easier to use. When I started attempting to cut the ferrets nails, these clippers did not perform well. They seemed dull and instead of cutting the nails off it bent them and ended up hurting my ferret. Save your money and buy a cheap pair of baby nail clippers. They work better and cost less.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: This is a well designed, comfortable product with decent audio results...it is simply too bad that it isn't as advertised.The biggest problem is its blue tooth connectivity. At best it is spotty. If you would like a headset that will function pretty well while you are sitting down and the back of the headset is pointing toward your Motorola phone, then this is a decent product. If, however, you actually want to move with both headset and phone, forget it.
__label__1 Always dropping us: We've owned this for too long. We're finally fed up!Pro:+Inexpensive... two-in-one+Relatively normal set up+Handled Apple and PC at the same timeCon:-Drops us constantly-Runs hotBottom line: Not recommended. Avoid.
__label__1 Not what we hoped: When I ordered this magazine, I wanted somethng that would help improve and give good tips for photography but it is primarily ads. When it comes, it is breezed through and tossed in the recycle bin.
__label__1 Great concept but the pockets are too small: I have a cheaper one I like much better that I bought years ago at Odd Job. This one is sturdy and has more pockets but they are very small and tight so it's hard to fit anything in them larger than a pin. Even bracelets have to be crammed in and a bulky necklace just would not fit. The few larger pockets are at the bottom - too low down to reach conveniently and not really that large. It might work for nails, screws, paper clips etc. - small stuff that you could easily see and get at.
__label__1 Painfully Bad: I finished this book because I was stuck on a plane and it was all I had to read, but it is so bad that the experience was painful. Nothing in the book is either believable or engaging. The characters are facades with no clear motivation and the actions are simply beyond all belief. It should have been a clear indication when I noticed there was no author's picture or bio on the book jacket. I wouldn't want to be associated with this mess either.
__label__1 Lapdog: Toobin is obviously another lapdog for the left. Anyone who thinks Clinton was the 'good guy' in all this is obviously part of the 'left-wing conspiracy' -- you know the one that has most of the media controled opinions/reporting in favor of poor, poor abused Bill. You know, the one that has people like Toobin who works for a liberal newspaper and news agency (ABC). I'd like to see an investigation in the voting records of America's media elite that pretend to be non-biased.
__label__2 The Enigma of Breaking the Code: "Breaking the Code" is a well acted and produced film based on the true story of a hero of the Second World War - Alan Turing. Some will only know the name Turing from the "Turing Test" which determines levels of artificial intelligence, but it was the work that Turing did in breaking the German "Enigma Code" that helped the Allies win the war. This film is couched in these events but more directly addresses the fact that Alan Turing was gay and that he was arrested, jailed and persecuted for his unashamed behavior. Despite being instrumental in saving the world from the ruthless Nazi world view of racial purity and social-cultural intolerance, once the war was over, the British government enacted a similar intolerance which ultimately ends in tragedy. Derek Jacobi delivers a masterful performance as Turing. It is a shame that this production is not available on DVD - I was thrilled to be able to find an excellent VHS copy!
__label__1 Garbage. A TOTAL EGO TRIP !!!: Self-serving and repetitive. Author loves to talk about great he is. Seldom has a book left such a lingering bad taste in my mouth.If you love to go into Tiffany's and have your overpriced jewelry presented to you in a little blue box, this book may be for you. Yawn. (It's actually one of his examples... need I say more.)If you're status-conscious and will pay 20 times what a product is really worth this book may be for you. Or maybe: if you're a status-conscious (lesser) sucker hoping to buy it (slightly used) for 5 times what it's really worth. Personally, I can only hope that the days of such hyperconsumerism are over.You can buy this book for a penny on Amazon. Not that it's worth it - but I'd call that TRUE "Future Shop", folks.
__label__1 Powderkeg/ No where to hide: Potential buyers of this title, beware, the quality is terrible. I have an old vhs copy of this film which blows away this dvd. I think somebody pinned up a white sheet projected a faded, scratched, spliced, 8mm film on to it, and then filmed it with a 1980's era video camera. It is a shame that there are those who will try to sell such decrepid transfers to film buffs trying to get a good copy of films they enjoy. For now I will just hang on to my old vhs, hopefully someone will bring this title out in a respectable transfer.
__label__2 A Gilbert & Sullivan bonanza: Although I have enjoyed this gargantuan set beyond all measure and enthusiastically recommend it for its musical charms, the prospective purchaser should be aware of two potential problems: no dialogue and, more importantly, no librettos. The latter deficiency may be determinative for those persons considering purchasing this set. (And before someone castigates my favorable opinion of the performances, I am well aware of the entirely different D'Oly Carte productions on Decca and enjoy them as well.)
__label__2 Need to Press button to see time on the dark: Good Little alarm clock. I purchased 2 of these to keep in our guest bedrooms, after my daughter complained that there were no clocks. Just be aware that in the dark, you have to press the button to make the display visible. This may or may not bother you.
__label__1 ALCOHOLLICA: They must have been loaded when they made this. If anyone wants to see my true feelings about this and the disgusting sequel to it; then check out my review of "Reload".If you're a true Metallica fan, as I am, then you already have both of these sorry attempts to imitate Metallica. You also know how I feel.What saddens me the most is that my 12 year old boy loves them. To add salt to that wound, I played "Master" for him and he didn't even believe that they were the same band! AT first I was upset, but now I have to agree with him.(he also thought that Puff Daddy wrote Kashmir) I don't blame him though, because that's what's happening to music today and Metallica has jumped right on that broken down mule.For real, true to the heart Metallica the way it's supposed to be, please buy "Kill 'Em All, "Ride The Lightning", Master Of Puppets"(my personal favorite) and the self-titled black album. I do like all three "Garage" EPs as well. They introduced me to alot of other great bands.
__label__1 No customer support and Bad Quality: Impossible is the word to describe trying to get in touch with Microtek customer service. Not only is the product extremely unreliable, but customer service and technical support would rather you not call them if you have problems. I have owned two Microtek scanners, both products not supported by the manufacturer
__label__1 not worthy the trouble of replacing the battery in the Norelco: I first tried to replace the NiCd battery with the new Metalhyride battery since they have a much larger current storage capacity. It turns out that the MH batteries tend to leak current so their voltage will drop steadily even without use. I then decided to replace the original NiCd battery with this one from Amazon.com (supposed to be exactly like the original one in my Norelco shaver). The battery turns out to last at most 14 shaves (ie two week) rather than the over 20 shaves I used to get from the original battery. After several charges I am getting only 10 shaves per charge. If this number drops further I would throw away the shaver. If I had known earlier that the replacement batteries are so much inferior to the original ones I would have bought a new shaver.
__label__2 Great tactical knife.: I always wanted to get this knife, feels great in your hand. Your hand will not slip due to the design of the handle which is a big plus. Nicely weighted, and a great price.
__label__2 My daughter loved it, did just what it said it did: The Easter Bunny brought this for my four and a half year old daughter. I really wrestled with buying a toy she saw on TV and was so determined to be good for with the Easter bunny.I am so glad we got it. I read some of the other reviews and even hesitated but figured if it wasn't a good thing well I would find out soon enough. It was great, worked great, my daughter loves it. Both my kids crack up at the dolls great laugh as it is not even annoying but really cute! She blows at least a dozen bubbles with each time. She is really cute and I am sure my daughter felt it was worth the "good behavior" for getting this from the Easter bunny, hee hee....
__label__2 Reusable coffee filter: I love the fact it is reusable but I do notice to tends to leave more of a "muddy" residue at the bottom of the cup (as compared to traditional paper filters). Coffee still tastes great.
__label__1 Western Digital 160 GB USB 2.0 Passport 2.5": I used this Hard Drive for one week and I had to return it. They sent a new Hard Drive to me immediately
__label__1 Only works with old iPods: this product does not work with the new 5G model. if you have a new ipod, do not purchase this, it will only allow the ipod to charge, not worth the money.
__label__1 Used batteries are probably not a good idea.: Bought a used battery for an older Canon S410, but it doesn't hold a charge any better than the battery being replaced, so it was not a wise move.
__label__1 Not her best: Mary Gaitskill is best when she's poking fun at herself a little bit. She doesn't do a lot of that in this book. I recommend the story collectionBecause They Wanted Tofor more self-aware work by Mary Gaitskill.
__label__1 There is nothing good in this album: I'll make this short, I've been trying to find something good in this but unfortentley there isn't, this is not just the worst album by Metallica , it might be the worst album ever made by a metal band. Those people who say that they like the album could not be a metal or metallica fan. They are fans of teh mainstream ... rock. The album does not have solos , drums sound like that if Lars was punding on trash cans and there very annoying, vovals are so lame.Face it guys , Metallica is history , James can't sing anymore nor an they wrote good music again.I so sorry that this happened to them.
__label__1 Concepts are sound, but CDs are awful: I agree with another reviewer that the CDs are not helpful at all. It's a bunch of people sitting around with Lucinda chit chatting about their anxiety. The concepts in the books are pretty good, but this whole set is incredibly overpriced for what you get. I feel like Lucinda and her company prey on the vulnerable. If it were really about helping people, the materials wouldn't be nearly so high-priced. And then they try to sell you a bunch of extras, like $30/bottle herbal supplements and crazy pricey phone therapy sessions. Save your money and get real help face-to-face with a therapist or with meatier less expensive self-help books.
__label__1 Too opinionated; not enough facts: There's some good information in this book, but nothing that you couldn't find at webmd.com, mayoclinic.com or - ASK YOUR PEDIATRICIAN!!!The book is opinionated and condescending, and is not entirely factual. It lists information for prevention of illnesses that simply is not factual.There is a lot of good basic information that is true but can be found almost anywhere else, but most importantly, through your child's physician.Save your money and make the most of your Dr.'s appointments.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS OR RENT IT!!!!!: I love Adam, but this is one of the worst movies I have everseen in my life.Thank goodness I only rented it.I saved my money, so please save yours!THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!
__label__1 Pretty Animation, Dull Story: At first look Gasaraki looks very good in terms of mecha design and animation. Gasaraki is undoubtedly one of the best looking animes I have ever seen but the story is very uneventful. They try to mix up mythology with mecha (kind of like in Neon Genesis Evangelion), but the story is lacking. In the first couple of episodes in the series there are actually some decent action scenes, however as the story progresses all they do is just talk. It basically becomes some kind of political drama mixed with some not so original religious type story. It is just very slow and in my opinion VERY VERY boring. It just drags on and on about politics and that stupid kai thing. For people who are looking for action and good story this will not be for you as this mediocre anime is seriously lacking in both.
__label__2 wonderful: this book gives a superb insight and explanation of how angels come into our lives and why
__label__2 Dont believe the hype.: Being honest this printer is not bad at all. In this technology age, people are looking for multifunctional printers that does everything, but write your homework for you. If you only need a printer that just prints this is a very great printer. This printer is perfect for children who do not need to fax and do other things. Even for adults who simply want to print documents. The size is perfect for the average desk space. It prints pretty fast despite the previous reviews. In fact it prints better than the printer i bought after it. It was a very new dell and I sent it back and kept using this one.
__label__2 Use it as a guide, but not exclusively: Use it as a guide, but not exclusively. Good for the basics and information, actually the best that I could find.It however was not fully updated. The update mainly has to do with prices. I visited Cambodia Nov - Dec 2010 and some of the prices were higher than those listed in the guide.The book was helpful when it came to Siem Reap and the ruins.I tend to use trip advisor and the lonely planet book together.
__label__2 This book is the best!: I started to read this book one night, and I couldn't put it down. I ended up reading the whole thing! It's about a brother and sister who have just moved to Cresent bay, CA. Scott, the brother, learns of a society who deals with ouiji boards and other retuals of that sort. Together, Scott and his sister, Becka, have to try to save this society before they get in over their heads. Its a great book and I would definatley recomend it to everyone! WARNING: All the books in this series leave you hanging, so be sure you're able to get the other books.
__label__2 Perfect: I'm jammin' with my harp for close to nothin'. No blues for this dude, only beautiful sounds resound in' around the neighborhood. Buy it. It's cheap and a lot of fun.
__label__1 Elevator Comedy: Novocaine for the funny bone. I ordered this CD along with one by Andy Andrist, because Stanhope recommended them both. Well, apparently ol' Dougie had one too many Jägermeisters that day, because, while Andrist is a flat-out hoot, this Barry guy doesn't even approach funny. His delivery is whiny and flat, and his material is occasionally amusing but that's about it. He'll have his own show on the Tee Vee someday, no doubt about it, along with the rest of the safe, marginally talented hacks who currently infest American airwaves.If you like Bill Hicks, Lenny Bruce, or Stanhope, avoid this guy like a bad sitcom.
__label__1 Stephen King's Desperation (2006)-Very weak screen adaptation.: Stephen King's Desperation (2006) was a poor two star film adaptation. I was only able to enjoy the first twenty minutes or so of Ron Perlman's work playing a Desperation road cop and then the movie turned to complete ka ka. This film was supposedly a mini "Stand", but I didn't see any comparison. It appeared to be a flimsy excuse for showing some very warped screen images that will stay in memory and make the audience never trust a police officer again! The on location scenery was very nice and was scoped out by King himself.
__label__2 Good Read: I really enjoyed this book. It kept me interested through each chapter and seemed to flow very well. I had a hard time putting it down at times. A good read!
__label__1 Good series Very poor DVD box: The problem with this DVD box is that it is extremely hard to take the DVD out. I nearly broke a DVD in the process of taking it out. I cant understand why the DVD creator had to go and create a new way of storing DVDs when this art has been mastered for hundreds of years. I really want my money back for this DVD set.
__label__2 Another excellent rh kirk release: Complex pounding beats, multi-layered sounds, another excellent techno-ambient-tribal release from rh kirk's electronic eye project. Also check out his other releases under this name - Neurometrik and possibly the best of the lot - Closed Circuit.
__label__2 Zombie genre flick updated: This is basically the old zombie movie plot updated. The zombies are those infected by a virus let loose on the world by misguided animal rights activists. What sets this apart is that it is well made by the same team that did, "Trainspotting" and that it is British. Good, fast-paced, suspense film.
__label__1 A disappointment: This book was a real disappointment for me. I bought it as a reference. It has a poor index; I do not usually find any of the common terms I am searching in it. The book is a fine example of what happens when nurses become too educated and concentrate on theory more than actual patient care. Do not get this book if you need a reference for the nursing care and procedures for childbirth in any form.
__label__2 A great favorite: This album contains two of my favorite Leon Redbone songs. "Shine on Harvest Moon" is, of course, a classic -- but this album will teach you the wonderful introduction that almost no one knows (except dedicated Leon Redbone fans). And then there is "Diddy Wa Diddy" which is sort of an old-time-blues vehicle that may have inspired Alice Cooper's "No More Mr. Nice Guy." I'll always wonder if it did.
__label__1 Great idea--if it would work!: Worked great--for 1 week. Now the iPod can't find/recognize the receiver unit, so the system won't work. The Apple website had a specific fix to try, but no luck. This happened after a rainy day run, but I can't imagine the unit isn't water resistant.Anyway, I loved it for a week; now it's going back.
__label__2 Don't care who you are, you are gonna love this.: Well, to start it off, I'm 14, white (if it matters) and I live on the south side, about 5 miles from downtown. Anyways... I dsaw the Ruff Ryders' Anthem on MTV once, and thought "Oh great, ANOTHER mc coming on the scene..." but let me tell you I was WRONG. My best friend, we'll call him Willie Dee, turned me onto this album. It's dark and gritty, but it's honesty is a thing of beauty, and his rhytym is dead on, and you can't normally find that in recent rap music. DMX kicks the masses so much, he's completely irresistable. And I'm not even that much into rap, just for the record.And if you play football, listen to this before every game. Your adrenaline will burst and your bloodlust will go through the roof. No joke, my team beat those other guys to bad...
__label__1 Do not buy to start a dead battery! only a booster.: It was fully charged and I tried to use on a dead car battery and it did nothing. I had to jump start with a 2nd car battery. Buyer beware, this is only a booster, not a jump starter. Jump starters are much heavier than this.
__label__2 What a great book!: I read this book years ago and loved it. I loaned it out and never got it back. It is the kind of book that you enjoy reading over after a few years, so I got a used book. It was in really good shape. I received it earlier than expected. I was very pleased!
__label__2 Phenomenal reference.: This book outlines so many aspects of our daily living and then injects spirituality in a way that synergizes the mundane and the sublime.Such an incredible source of wisdom for living the practical/everyday in a full-hearted and spiritual manner.
__label__1 Wireless yes, Good no.: The product arrived from seller as stated in new condition. Upon opening with great excitement the huge USB receiver for the keyboard and mouse destroyed the mood immediately. After the aesthetic let down I plugged up keyboard and mouse to find the range was terrible. You have to have the receiver almost on top of the keyboard and mouse for it to work. After about a month of use the batteries died, and I grew tired of the hassle threw the set away and bought a new keyboard and mouse. Would not recommend the combo to my enemies let alone friends. Terrible buy.
__label__1 If only I could give it less than one star.: Pathetic. I had expected more from the general public. How can anyone find this formulaic, predictable, overly praised, boring, no brainer excuse for a comedy, entertaining? The dialogue was just inane, and over-simplified, at least I had thought it to be simple, but for others, which greatly disturbs me about the current state of the American psyche, it was 'genius'? Don't make me vomit. It was like Steve Martin's 'Father Of The Bride' only worse.The only joke that was funny was the 'focker' thing, and that got old after the second time someone said it. They based their whole movie on the linguistic gag of 'focker' and a cat peeing. Big (...)deal.And if that wasn't depressing enough. They are releasing a sequel.
__label__2 fun and entertaining: This video of French pre-schoolers is totally cute and fun. Our 18 month old absolutely loves it, and frankly it's ten times better than most other baby vids out there (with the exception of Baby Einstein and Elmo, both of which also rock). It's definitely low budget, but that's part of the charm.
__label__2 Know why things are as they are: This book traces theology from the Early Church period through the Lutheran Reformation. People often wonder why different Christian groups differ from one another in belief. This book is a big help. Although not light reading, it shows how individual religious leaders emphasized some point in such a way that it bent what was taught and believed in various movements. It is a very good resource to have and to use.
__label__2 White-hot, sex-filled page-turner: I have to admit that I bought the book solely based on the really hot cover. I mostly read non-fiction, but the story grabbed me from the second page and now I think this is THE BEST NOVEL I'VE EVER READ! There is more than enough sex to satisfy anyone who expects a hot time after looking at the cover. The writer knows Hollywood and isn't afraid to name names. I hope there is a sequel coming soon!!!
__label__1 No Good: This self retracting phone cord is just as bad as the regular phone cord I had. Within a few days the cord became so twisted that I opted to just use the speaker phone option instead of picking up the phone. The retractable device puts too much weight on the receiver. I am going to return this product.
__label__1 This DVD is horrible: This is not the Columbia DVD. That one is wonderful. This DVD looks like a very old VHS tape, one that was kept in the sun for years. Its that bad. If you want Fist of Fury, pay a little more for the Columbia version.
__label__1 Don't buy it unless you use Borland ORB: This book is only useful if u have Borland's ORB. The examples DO NOT RUN without it. Go with SUN documentation if you wonna write truly portable clients
__label__2 BEST VALUE IN BASKETBALL.: WHEN THE BEST COLLEGE COACH OF ALL TIME TELLS YOU HIS OFFENSE AND THEN SHOWS YOU IN DETAIL HOW TO USE IT - IT'S PRICELESS. WATCH THE DVD FIRST AND THEN READ THE BOOK.
__label__2 Good product for the price: I have this on my deck holding up a rather heavy umbrella. The wind during a thunderstorm has knocked the combo together over twice but otherwise it has held up well. The design is very nice, sturdy, heavy,great color, hasn't worn out in the weather. Great product for the price.
__label__2 moisturizes as promised: This conditioner pretty much works as it promises. It moisturizes hair very well. The only negative is that, despite the product touting its scent, the scent isn't really all that (but it isn't bad either). The product is a bit pricey, but it's less expensive (ounce for ounce) than most salon brands.
__label__2 Lucy Stone: She did it again, she wrote an interesting book. I enjoyed every minute of the book, hope everyone else enjoys the book.
__label__1 Poor writing style: OK plot, but I was appalled by the shallow characters and weak, repetitive writing style. At a certain point I started counting the number of paragraphs that started with the words "Carmella shrugged", but I lost count.Some authors improve with each new book, others just crank them out. In this case, the author and publisher are clearly on auto-pilot.
__label__1 HORRIBLE!: My best advise is to never buy a memory card online! I couldn't save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time. I suggest not to buy memory cards online.
__label__1 Once More, Into the Blech: This is just a series of contrivances mashed into a brick of paper.What on earth is everyone thinking? Go read Glen Cook or George R. R. Martin.
__label__1 Such a waste!: There is no natural cure for anything in this book. If you want to know he tells you to subscribe to his website for a monthly fee to find out what the cures are. Otherwise he tells you loads of stuff you already know if you have much common sense or interest in nutrition. He also tells you to practice Scientology/Dianetics! Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money!
__label__2 Cute: This breakfast bar is really cute. It was kind of hard to put together with the included tools though. I recommend using an electric screwdriver with the proper bits. The stools were also smaller than I anticipated, but it doesn't matter much since I'm short.
__label__1 it not hard to hate this film: Banal in all aspect, increasying stupid as it goes on, S.I.L is more of an Embarrasment to shakespeare than any kind of respectful showing. The acting is across the board awfull. Paltorw bored me to tears in a no brainer , borad caritured role. A role which was more to show off her"ravish"( more like aneroxic and fake) beauty than any real acting talent. Paltorw ranks in the very bottom of all actors and cant hold a candle of to her british counter parts. THe films dialogue is akward and clunky and complety devoid of wit. There is no romance or intrest to the story at all. And the now the sotry telling, over use of the paning camera, the visual style is uneven. Basicly and awfull film in all respect. THe reason why the film won some many oscars is this $
__label__1 Something missing for me: As far as sci-fi goes, we can all do better. I mean, the characters, the plot, the subplots -- what the heck happened? I'm sure that Gray was trying to mimic the slice of life aspect, but he rode that starcruiser too many darn light years for my liking. There was no ambiguous moral message like you find in Clarke's work, just a lot of obvious ones like you'd find in Bradbury's weaker work. I do feel a little more comfortable with my sexuality though, but at what price? I could have been re-reading my Piers Anthony books instead.
__label__1 Dangerous: Michelle Smith & Dr. Lawrence Pazder Michelle Remembers (1980). This is the first and probably the most important of the Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) books. It allegedly documents horrendous abuse suffered by Michelle at the hands of a Satanic cult. This single book gave a kick start to the entire SRA movement in the early 1980's. The Wiccan Information Network and other groups have found that much of the book content was derived from Dr. Pazder's personal studies of African native rituals, rather than from Michelle's memories. When the accuracy of his book was questioned during a seminar, Dr. Pazder stated that he and Michelle had never claimed that the events in the book actually happened! He is now promoting "Sadistic Ritual Abuse" as the new definition of SRA. He believes that the Satanic conspiracy does not exist. He believes that recovered memories of SRA during childhood are often based on real memories of incest to which a false overlay of Satanic ri! tual has been added.
__label__1 Keeps Squirrels out but where are the birds?: I bought 2 squirrel proof feeders and this one may keep the squirrels out but it does nothing to attract birds. The feed holes at the bottom of the feeder seem to be too hard to get food from therefore the birds congregate on my other feeder which works great! I would not recommend this feeder.
__label__2 Pretty Good Introductory Book on Drawing: This is a good book about drawing, but it's not an excellent book. Yes, it says it's for dummies and sometimes I think I qualify, but I was expecting more examples. I was expecting to be held by the hand as we, the authors and I, worked through several drawings from start to finish.Still, I got out of the book. I learned quite a bit about composition and perspective. I like the fact that the book tells you to have a positive attitude and I like how I learned how to see lines and shapes, but did the book make an artist out of this dummy? No it did not. Did it teach me how to draw? Some. Did I learn a lot? Yes.
__label__1 Not available.: I have tried more than once to order this title on my Kindle. It never arrives. Hard to review a book you can't get a hold of.
__label__1 Another Extremely disappointed Buyer: This book is nothing more than a rehash introduction to Java programming. You can find cheaper books on this subject as well as free tutorials on the web. There is very little of this book dedicated to actual game programming that can be used in today's game development. Some of the material covered on gaming I have seen in early and I mean earlier books. To have a book released in 2003 and not cover or even mention Java 3D or OpenGL is shameful. I don't know what the reason for releasing a Game Programming book without covering modern material is beyond me but perhaps the comments by one of the authors that the primary reason for the book was to make money is the clue. Come on guys.....that should have been edited out of the book.
__label__2 a great trike for 2 year old: I bought 2 of these trikes for my b/g twins second birthday. They are the perfect size for their age. They arrived in excellent condition and were fairly simple to put together. I read the reviews here before buying them and want to add that some of the reviews say that the rubber tires smell very bad. Well that is the case when you buy anything with rubber tires. It will have a very heavy smell to it for a little while. That is not a negative aspect of this trike, that is just the way it is when you buy something with rubber tires (that comes in a box). When we bought out stroller with rubber tires, the smell was the same for a little while. I have nothing negative to say about the trike. An excellent product and the best price I have found.
__label__1 Great bike rack: Love this bike rack. Very easy to put on and take off. Bikes are easy to put on and held 3 bikes no problem.
__label__2 Couldn't put it down: I read this book cover to cover in 2 days because I simply couldn't put it down! I love backpacking and hiking, but not as much as I do after reading this book. I almost took a blow-dryer up to the mountains to try to melt the snow faster so I could get on with the backpacking trip I had planned in Yosemite prior to reading the book. It left me guessing till the end. The imagery in the book really made me feel like I was in the mountains, and probably painted a more beautiful image in my mind than I would have experienced with my eyes. The passion that Randy had for the Sierra was wonderfully portrayed by the author. I recommend this book to anyone.
__label__1 Books needs ratings like movies for explicit sex, language, and violence: I read a few Amazon reviews before purchasing this book. I wish I had seen the review by Ash. I agree that this book is "Utter Dreck". There should be ratings on books just as there are on movies about explicit sex, language, and violence. I wish I had not read this book and can not possibly finish it.SHAME ON AMAZON for not putting warnings on books like these!
__label__1 Tom Imitates Life: In someone else's nightmare Tom awoke and screamed and screamed and screamed. He felt helpless. "Feed The Beast With More Product," Tom thought. No avail. But because he had never bitten the hand, the beast fed Tom and the public seemed satisfied. Now they are both well fed and fat. Tom, get out of my nightmare, Real Gone!
__label__2 Phantom Stallion is a Great Series!: I have read the first thirteen of the Phantom Stallion series, and Rain Dance is one of my favorites. Like all the Phantom Stallion books, a lot of different story lines are presented throughout the book. You get to know not only the human characters, but also the horses, each of which have their own personality as well. I really liked the excitement of a foal being born! I highly recommend the Phantom Stallion series for any horse lover!
__label__2 In Case You Need Any More Convincing: Not only is this one of the cornerstones of any popular music collection, it's just plain fun. Since I finally scored this set, I've just been driving around with it in my car grinning like a fool. No, he's not Segovia but he really COULD play the guitar just like a-ringin' a bell.
__label__2 Nice boots!: I really like this pair of boots, although I live in Miami, Florida where the sun is everywhere they are comfortable, I'm a civil engineer and I have to drive and visit jobsites all the time, they feel comfortable while driving and excellent walking at work, now is quite dificult to give them up!
__label__2 Makes a great gift !: I purchased this item as a gift for my teenage son. He needed a new hat for summer time activies and I knew he liked the Bleach graphic novels. He just loves the hat. In fact the only problem that I can see with the product is that my son doesn't want to take it off now!
__label__2 brave Virginian boys: I hope this book will earn the state of Virginia some national recognition. A company of Virginian boys in the 116th Regiment, I noted, suffered the heaviest casualties in the first wave on Omaha Beach for the sake of victory. My state has had some very great people!
__label__1 incompatible: This DVD was not compatible with any of my players,or I assume any others made for the USA, although this was not mentioned in the product's description.
__label__2 classic redbone: from the first notes to the last verse this album is a redbone classic. fans of the "gravelly voiced" one will love the melodies and ironies of the lyrics and the southern tempo in the songs. nasal and slurred as his style is these songs are tuned to that approach and the album meshes very well. I added this album to my collection due to the individual style of Mr redbone and was not disappointed. he is unique and very distinctive.. A +
__label__1 Awful: I am an AFI fan, but this record is just an atrocity to the eardrums. It is remiscent of really bad Offspring if you took away all the things that the Offspring did good. You would be better off buying "Smash" and "Sing the Sorrow" thatn this exercise in pain.
__label__2 Completely satisfied: I just purchased this product and couldn't be happier! I actually had to return the item because the first one I received was defective (called Lowrance tech support and verified that in a matter of minutes when couldn't aquire any satelites), but Amazon made that process painless by shipping out a new one the day I called them about it and sending me a prepaid return label to return the defective one. I received my new item in two days and it works great!! A lot of the other reviews mention problems with signal, but I live in the BOOOONNNIIEESS and have never lost signal once it is aquired (which never takes over two minutes or so). Even on the cloudiest day, this unit stays locked. I even sat it in the floorboard of the truck to see what would happen and it stayed locked. So...to all the naysayers I would state that this unit is well worth the money and has so far performed as well as the in car unit I used recently in a rental car during a trip to Germany. Great little unit.
__label__1 stick to rayguns!: I must say that the woman-woman bashing and back stabbing that goes on is more ferocious than any that goes on between men. Be warned-Noonan holds no bars. However, when she goes to make a case against Hillary I find that her "facts" are just not supported. I'd love to see a well-researched attack on Hillary because I think find her a conservative "Republicrat" who doesn't stand for liberalism like she should. But to label her a raging liberal? (As a liberal, I'm insulted!) Ms. Noonan should stick to writing worshipful "books" on the Gipper. They're not good, by any means, but at least that way her ... is benign.
__label__2 Dry food: This thing does what it says. It takes a long time to dry certain items and because there is a heater at the bottom food 'cooks' slightly but overall an easy to use and reliable product. Don't leave it too close to your oven though, the unit is made of a pretty cheap plastic and it will melt and deform easily.
__label__2 A really great movie: This is the best movie I've seen for a while. With all of the really [junky] movies that have come out recently, I was really glad to have finally found a good one. The Bourne Identity was intense and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I've seen it twice already and I'm planning to buy it on DVD. Matt Damon and his co-star were a great pair, and I felt that Damon's performance was unusually convincing and interesting. If you've been trying to decide which movie to go to, don't see Scooby Doo or undercover brother (though that was pretty funny), see the Bourne identity. If you've already seen the Bourne Identity, give The Sum of All Fears a try--thet was pretty good as well.
__label__2 Camping Shade: Nice quality and cheap enough price at the time I ordered. I was hoping it would come with suction cups, but it's meant to be scewed into place. I'm planning on using them as window shades in my SUV while camping. I got them at such a low price, I'll go out and get some screw-in suction cups to use them on windows.
__label__1 Smells like cashing in: not many tracks considering the price. people need to get into perspective that this is just an over rated band. the most over rated in history i would argue! Certainly some amazing songs especially the ballads but no where near worthy of the best band ever title. All these songs have been flogged and there is a smell of cashing in about these remastered albums.
__label__2 Excellent product for colostomy type dressings: Service from this company is tremendous, best I've ever had. Pricing is also very reasonable.
__label__2 vrry funny: This is a movie that adults will like very funny and lots of action for a movie with a stuffed animal for a main character. The actors all did a great job .
__label__2 Physician who absolutely loves this book, GREAT FIND!: I am so estactic that I have found such a great tool to help myself, my family and my patients. This book is professionally articulated, instructions are easy to understand, exercises are easy to follow and accomplish and the results are truly gratifying! My wife and I have been using Miss Maggio's book and audio tapes for well over a year with gratifying results. We have found that it has toned our chin,neck and jawline, it has given us back our cheek bones that we have long forgot about, it has opened our eyes and has made our faces appear fuller and more youthfull. WE ARE THRILLED! This book, GETS RESULTS! I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to look younger and compliment any facial cosmetic surgery.
__label__2 Super Product: I bought this as a replacement for an old (but good, I thought) Gateway keyboard. This is the best keyboard I've used in my 30 years of using computers. Well built and for me it's the Rolls Royce of keyboards. The fact that it is a smaller layout works fine for me. I have average sized hands that fit very nicely on the soft touch keys. Plus it is a classy looking piece
__label__2 Excellent Book: I now have all of Lloyd and Herman's books. I am also a volunteer E.M.T. I read this book in approx. 2 nights. I thought it was excellent reading. I felt like I was right there treating the patients. If you are wondering what it's like to be a volunteer E.M.T. then this is book is a must read.
__label__1 Not for me: This book convinced me that I'm no longer a Jodi Picoult reader. I get why some people would like it--the flowery imagery and heart-wrenching subject matter pulls at the heart; but I found the book to be overwritten and sensational. Besides, I couldn't identify with the main character who would add trauma to her already traumatized son by taking the law into her own hands. Picoult is known for her ability to end the story with an unforeseen twist and to effectively use various points of views; I guessed every twist in the book well in advance and I felt like each character had the same emotive voice, even the construction-worker husband. I like women's fiction, but this was a bit too much.
__label__2 different and worthy!: True, Wohnton is very different from all other Oval albums. Actually, it's not like any other CD I've ever come across. But it's also a very *good* CD!A bizarre mix of oval glitches with a peculiar (and humorously almost off key) vocalist and some lazy drums. I don't know how to describe much better since I can't think of anything to compare it to.If you like Oval, I would still recommend this. Just be cautious, because not all of Oval's fans will care about this under-rated release.
__label__1 A not-so-classic classic!: This book has very little going for it. It was not exciting, not interesting, and definitly not haunting in any way. I was left wondering if some of the pages of my edition were missing. I felt that the story just plodded along with very little action. The book was like an outline for a really neat story. Maybe the film that is coming out this summer will have a lot of the substance that this one lacked.
__label__2 School Counselor Review for Praxis: The study guide was accurate in assisting to prepare for the test. Would definitely recommend the purchase of the guide.
__label__2 Decent read - not a page turner but has great concepts: Peter Drucker -the godfather of management science - has done a good job of creating a handbook that contains an excellent set of tools for any aspiring (or current) entrepreneur. This book contains tips for the existing business, start-ups, and non-profits; so there's something in it for everyone. The first part of the book describes Drucker's Seven Steps for Innovation - which provide a great template to use to analyze the environment in search of new business opportunities. Anyone who wants to strike out on their own (like myself) can definitely utilize these steps to help gain direction in their journey.Admittedly, not a page turner but a good read for any business person who wants to advance their business or selves through innovation and entrepreneurship.
__label__2 Dr. Chopra Is The Greatest: Kudos to [those] who have rightly hailed this latest masterpiece of Dr. Chopra's. The good Doctor has been a leader in bringing Eastern ideas on health to skeptical Western audiences.In this book, he accomplishes something vastly more ambitious. With the clarity that distinguishes all of his work, he explains how anyone may come to know the Almighty. His approach is non-denominational throughout, so that all may benefit, be he Jew, Christian, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist.I would recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the topic. It will make a believer out of you!
__label__2 Great Product: Surprisingly good sound quality for such a small unit. Battery operation a big plus on portability. Also, adapters add value in that I have an older iPod that I exchange with the newer, easily done. Use as portable speaker for another input source other than iPod.
__label__1 What was that all about?: Predictible (and how so), incoherent, and just soooo boring.... Huge disappointment. Why was the miniseries so long? Did he get paid per minute? Per page? Where is the King of Shining, Firestarter, Carrie? Goodbye Stephen, the king is dead.
__label__1 I agree with everyone else: I am a man who loves his classic rock, but I don't shun modern music. However though, I just hate bands like these who add Absolutly nothing to to the music scene other than giving people urges to gouge their ears out. This is just terrible. Laffy Taffy is the worst song of the year.We need some good music to come out. I can't say that much, other than this stuff will be on it's way. Read the other reviews as well, they all know what they are talking about, but I am just adding the back up, for the sake of power in numbers.
__label__1 Very repetitive- and, let's face it...: She's not *quite* a master yet. I am an elementary school art teacher, and over the years I have observed more extraordinary child-artists than Alexandra Nechita. Her paintings are extremely repetitive and in the process of this book her art doesn't develop at all.
__label__2 great blues: This is BB King in his early years, with not only his excellent blues guitar skills but along with his younger vocal touch,that makes this cd a must for blues lovers.
__label__1 No Cures is a better title: He, Trudeau, has been arrested and jailed for credit card fraud. The book just complains and as others have noted, there is NOTHING in the book about "Cures". He wants you to visit his website and give HIM your credit card # to get his advice.Read my 1st sentence! I have read blogs where people foolish enough to do so found there is NOTHING, zero contect on his website. Do Not Waste Your Time and Money Making this Con Artist richer than he is. There are other legitimate books on this topic you can buy.
__label__2 Love it and plays perfect: What can I say, its a bluray so it plays awesome and with the regular dvd, I can watch it in other rooms where bluray players aren't available. Love it!!!
__label__2 Kitty likes it!: I bought this for a feral cat I care for to help her keep cool in the Phoenix summer heat. She likes it and uses it a lot. She doesn't like to lay on it when it's wet, though (it takes a couple hours for the surface to dry out after soaking). Item seems a little pricey for what you get (the mat is small), but the cat is happy and the mat does what it promises, so I think it was money well spent.
__label__2 Nice Bar: I bought this for two reasons, to get the ball a bit further behind my SUV to miss the spare tire (that hangs on the back) and for adjustability. Both aspects are there. Height adjustment is in 1.5 inch steps but that seems OK. The fit/finish is just OK but consistent with other bars I own. The main thing is it is heavy and sturdy and should do the job. I put a locking 5/8 pin on it so the ball end cannot be removed to take my trailer. It does not come with a pin but that was not an issue, I have extra non-locking pins if I wanted to use one. Now I am considering a multi-ball kit so I can more easily switch balls.Jim
__label__2 O, Mamamia!!!: Whether or not you know the music of ABBA, it's a romp!This is definitely eye candy. It's Greek island setting is beautiful.It's worth the price just to see Pierce Brosnan sing and dance in disco drag.
__label__2 Mrs.: I love this cough syrup I use it all of the time.It is thing I have ever used,and receive in a timely maner
__label__2 Funny Females: Feminism is not a dirty word...but this book does have dirty words in it. If you want to read some sexy, slinky, smart, funny stories about real women, here they are.
__label__2 Bevel won't return to 0 properly: Nice saw overall, but the bevel detent is junk. Depending on whether you're returning the saw to 0 from the left or the right, the blade will be up to 2 degrees off zero - meaning I have to check it with a square every time. Inexcusable, from a saw in this class.
__label__2 I miss mine now that I have another newborn...: This is a wonderful pump. Very strong in strength and I was able to pump milk for my baby his first year of life with no problems. He didn't take to the breast but this pump would give me twice the amount he needed every time I pumped/
__label__2 lupin the third for kids: monkey punch's lupin the third was recreated by a few directors and this one was from Mr. Hayao Miyazaki, but this movie was made a decade after the original TV series, so a huge difference from the original TV series. The original was soooo slick and dry that i felt i was watching something that not suite for my age. :D however, it was really well made and so popular. so from the point of view, this motive was for children friendly version of lupin the third. if you are older than 15 years old, you may want to watch the original TV series. you would not believe it was made like in 1970 or 1971.
__label__2 As Advertised . . .: This memoir by a newspaper columnist of his life--from his time as a newlywed to his time as a father of three--with the "worst dog in the world," the family Labrador, is exactly what you would expect. It reads with the facile but warm human insight and light humor one would expect from a popular columnist required to create 500 entertaining words three days a week. Dog lovers will not be disappointed.
__label__1 dont was delivery to me in Costa Rica: Is the second time that I buy somethink from this vendor and i dont receive it in the final destination
__label__2 Best of the Nineties & Twothousands: I was really astonished when I read it in 2000. I re-read it now and still think this is a masterpiece of the last 10-15 years. For the plot, for the writing and because of its dark humour.Palahniuk, together with Foster Wallace is one of the few for which buying a new writer book is still something to do.
__label__1 Not a good product: This charger causes all my Ipods to freeze up when charging and I usually must do a reset before being able to use it again. It works fine as a USB charger just not as an AC adapter.
__label__2 Good, but too expensive: I have always found these to be quality water filters for my pitcher.The only problem is that they are too expensive for what they are. They say they are good up to 40 gallons, which is not a lot for a full family + dogs.
__label__1 Terrible Sound Quality, Questionable Track Choices!: I guess I only have myself to blame for not doing enough research before getting this but the reason why I went for this and not the more popular remastered "Hits" is because I really wanted "Keep the Fire Burning" which for some reason is not there. I could live with the track selections that do leave out quite a lot of better tracks that are found on the "Hits" package but the poor sound quality is what really gets me. Definitely a misnomer as this is certainly not the best of REO either in track selections or in sound quality.
__label__1 Great start: I really loved the beginning of this book and the heroine who knocks her criminal husband out. Kelly is eccentric, dyes her hair and has everything pierced. She meets and moves in with an even more eccentric woman and, all together, there was just TOO much eccentric in one place.I would have enjoyed the book a lot more without so much Myrtle.
__label__2 yes!: Simpson's are like my own family, minus the cat, dog, baby and little sister. Oh yeah, I'm from India! Keep the DVDs coming guys!jpg
__label__1 Great title, but dissapointing content: The book grabs the reader with an interesting title then immediately starts off with a look at a boring movie and then reviews of even more boring competing therories. Finally the authors reveal the information ecology therory. Unfortuanately, the don't offer much to back up their view and paint a picture of it being another feel good PC therory. Too bad since they have a valid point that will sadly be lost as another PC mistake...
__label__1 Wait for DVD: Certainly earned a few laughs, but too many drug references and jokes on obesity. The film fell short of satisfying my expectations.
__label__2 Wonderful Holiday Special for all ages: My family and I love this Holiday special. In fact, we think it is one of the best we have ever seen. We look forward to seeing it every year on PBS and decided that we should have our own copy. Why do we love Arthur's Perfect Christmas? Well, it is family friendly, entertaining AND educational. They discuss Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, St. Lucia Day and a non-religious celebration all wrapped up with an interesting story (and a lesson or two) about friendship, family and the true spirit of the holiday season-regardless of your religion. Definitely a classic in the making-a must see!
__label__2 OK Book: These are all things that I do regularly in college. It's not a big deal. Everyone does it! I guess I was expecting more than I got out of the book. The System by Roy Valentine is a better book on college sex, partying etc. But don't worry about Charlotte Simmons - she'll grow up to be a good boring desperate housewife like she was taught before going off to college.
__label__2 The first spirutual book which i read fully.: This is the book with a proper blend of normal story and spiritual thinking.The script is well written which keeps you going on and on till you finish. I really enjoyed reading it. Some of the concepts explained in the book have already been implemented by certain Spiritual Healers Associations in India. It's worth a read.
__label__1 Two And A Half Stars - Disappointing.: I start with the premise that I am experiencing a recent loss and have lost many people in my life over the years. When they label that this is from the 'History' Channel - they aren't kidding, almost Nothing about current experiences and anything other that pure relegious reinforcement - if you are already convinced and locked into your faith of the afterlife. Lots of babble about what releigious leader - name and so forth of who came up with which concept. A child who saw the otherside from a near-death experience is inspirational - they go a bit into the angle of terrorists and If they go to Heaven (too much time spent on them).I also bought and watched the Barbara Walters Special (DVD) on Heaven - and it was less disappointing than this one. Still looking for something deeper and clearer - on a pure spiritual level.Sincerely, Scott M.
__label__1 Shower head emits copper: I've been using this shower filter for a couple months. The filter seems to work fine, but in the last few weeks I've noticed a metallic smell in the water. It smelled like copper. Upon closer inspection I found copper deposits building up on the inner surfaces of the head. I replaced the head with another that doesn't have a copper element and the problem was resolved. This type of copper exposure is not simply unpleasant (your skin ends up smelling like copper), but it is also potentially unsafe.
__label__2 An amazing voice: After hearing about Ms. Hagan on NPR I listened to everything I could. The early recordings although not quite my style were very interesting. I came away with the feeling that this was a wonderful voice. This CD only emphasized this for me. The mixture of the German and English was wonderful to listen to. Her voice can really transport one`s mind to other times and places. I only hope that this is not the last we hear from her. Who knows what could be next?
__label__1 poor build, terrible customer service: Although the sound quality is good, they are built very poorly, malfunction quickly, and the V-Moda customer service is terrible. I enjoyed these for several months of regular use at normal volume before the left earbud stopped working (first cutting in and out with the cord's slightest movement). When I contacted V-Moda's warranty department - exactly following the instructions on their webpage - they never responded.Check the reviews of this product: loss of sound in one or both earbuds is a very common problem after several months' usage. There are several other earbuds in this price range with professional build quality and responsive customer service. Do not waste your money on a company that builds shoddy products and does not respect its customers.
__label__1 Major Design Flaw--Asking Kitchenaid to Replace: I was cleaning my very dusty kitchenaid chrome food processor today and when I released the bowl a chip of plastic came off the handle. My blood boiled...why was it dusty (and now chipped)?? Because it is completely useless in the 9 cup capacity. The inner plastic sleeve/tube is too short and the sauces and pestos I make ooze right up over that tube and all over the machine and counter. It's disgusting and to add insult to injury is hard to clean the now gooped up base! Why on earth would they design something so poorly. Don't they test these first? Did they think no one would use the 9 cup bowl? The mini-bowl is better, but none of my recipes work in that small of a bowl. This machine is worthless. I have written to kitchenaid today to complain as well. I want them to to replace it or at the least give me a bowl that works with out spilling all over. This was supposed to be top of the line--well it's bottom of the barrel--don't buy it.
__label__2 comfort food!: I grew up in Europe, and missed having hazelnut products after moving to the USA. Whenever I bake with hazelnuts, it makes the perfect comfort foods! Hazelnut cookies, hazelnut cake with mocha butter icing and dark chocolate... I have cracked them myself, and ground them in my coffee grinder. Now that I have found them online, I will be saved the effort! Excellent product!Definitely store in the freezer when not using. Don't want the oils to go bad, such a waste.
__label__2 Moving!!: This man can really pull his audience in and explain the magnitude and majesty of God, while also making sure they understand how much God cares about each one of us. No one will walk away from one of his videos without some change taking place.
__label__1 Make sure it fits your car....: We got this travel system as a gift. At first we really loved it but when we went to put the car seat into the car's it fit fine in our SUV but you have to pull very tight on the straps to keep it from moving side to side. When we put it in our acura was another story. Since we didnt have the latch system in this car we had a hard time getting the base to stay tight so then we took the base out and the seat belt wouldnt go around the back of the car seat. So make sure you try it out before you buy it!!!
__label__2 best for beginners: Although this text is a vital first step in design education, it falls short for an experienced designer; basic juxtaposition, etc. Get it out of a library and spend your money on any of the Looking Closer series by Michael Beirut... they will infinitely expand your perceptions of what design is and explores contemporary issues facing designers today.
__label__1 Not really for kids: I got the boat for my son (7 year). It was not 100% waterproof and I had to "reseal" it after the first day. Nevertheless the internal electronics started to corrode. Invested a lot of time and effort to keep the boat running. I assume with 100% care and tenderness the boat works like a charm, but thats not how kids play.
__label__1 I don't get it: This was the dumbest movie I have seen in a very long time. It's advertised as a comedy, and we are supposed to accept Eddie Murphy as a serious character after being told otherwise? Watching paint dry was more entertaining than watching this. Oh yeah, one more hot top- if the focus of the film is really on Jeff Goldblum's character development, you don't cast a major star in a supporting role because it takes the spotlight off the main character. If you want comedy, grab "Beverly Hills Cop" or "48 Hours". This is a bomb.
__label__1 "Is this art?": Rob Zombie's vision of art is little more the repulsive visuals with a minimum of talent to back it up. 'Astro-Creep 2000' is more of a portfolio then it is anything else. The band is at its worst on songs like "I Zombie" and "Blood Milk and Sky". I guess if you looked at this CD as a teeny bopper horror movie then it might have more appeal. The only songs that show what Zombie and the crew could do are "More Human Than Human" and "Real Solution #9". These are both great songs and have an intesting sound. But thats as far as it goes. Rob Zombie's best bet is to let his band join in more on the song writing. He seems to think that his style is the only style, and that his style is good. Well, he is wrong on both accounts. But until we hear more of the band, White Zombie should just be called Rob Zombie's Tour Band!
__label__1 5...6...7....8....9....9 1/2....: The film opens with Bugle (Alvin Cowan) working as a boxing hustler. There is also a subplot about gold on Black Claw land. Prospectors are killed. The deed holder has an idea that if they get a girl kidnapped (Katy Maloney) the cavalry will wipe out the Indians and they will be free to dig.The film had some minor humor in it. There were anachronisms in the speech, especially the Indian woman (Kristen Alaniz) whose speech greatly contrasted the cliche Indian talk used by the rest of her tribe. The acting and script were Asylum grade bad. The beautiful scenery that normally accompanies westerns was not present as it appears most of the filming was done on a set. The Indian bows had all the spring and appearance of a dime store bow and arrow set.Unless you want camp and cheese, avoid the film.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
__label__1 It's Dubbed!: It's dubbed - and not very skillfully either. Yuck. I couldn't watch it, so I can't complain otherwise.
__label__2 Works as advertised, depending on the type of smoke alarm: I had 3 of these installed in smoke alarms in May 2003, so was disappointed when two of them failed after about 4 years, and the last one just began to beep after exactly 5 years.But then I discovered that the alarms I'm using have dual sensors (First Alert SA301), containing both an ionization and a photoelectric [these are not hard-wired, the battery does it all]. Therefore, if in reality, the batteries are running two detectors at once, I guess it shouldn't surprise me that they lasted half as long as advertised. Also, my alarm doesn't qualify for the 10 year warranty, because it contains a photoelectric sensor - the warranty is for ionization sensors only.Cost wise it's probably a wash, one could buy several alkalines for the cost of this one. But the savings is on time: not having to change the batteries as often.
__label__1 Racist Ideologies wrapped in a PhD: This book is horrible. It's hard to believe that anyone could in any way justify the slaughter and enslavement of millions of Native people, but this author found a way. Definitely not a text I would use in a scholarly setting, as the author supports the idea that the Natives were enslaved because they "worshipped the Devil." The author and his magical theories reflect the racist, Christian/Euro-centric ideologies so prevalent in America.This book is offensive, but good for a laugh and reality check as to the state of racism in academia and America.
__label__1 Not GI Quality: On a positive note, this poncho is much lighter than the military issued model. I have not field tested this poncho, but I have serious doubts about the quality. Mine was missing one grommet. The color and pattern are okay, but somewhat lighter than the picture. This poncho may not be ready for serious use, but it's probably okay to stick one in your bug out bag for emergency rain wear or shelter.
__label__1 Could'nt believe it!: I purchased this same stand through Amazon a year or so back and it went together like a gloove and I have been very pleased with it. I would give it five stars. I ordered another one a couple a weeks ago disregarding the poor ratings at Amazon. When it arrived the box was half open. Luckily all the componets were still inside but the top was damaged on one corner. When I assembled the stand I found that the four top braces were a inch and one half to short. I assembled it anyway with great effort and sure enough the holes in the top would not line up. Will have to drill new holes if I don't decide to send it back.Shame on Delta for letting a quaility table get out with wrong parts in it. Seems there are quality and packaging issues here!
__label__2 When demons walk the earth: "Demons," directed by Lamberto Bava, is a horror film that tells a fairly straightforward story. A mysterious man in a metal mask hands out film tickets to unsuspecting commuters. This sets in motion a chain of events that leads to the unleashing of a plague of demons upon the earth.Bava cleverly uses the film-within-a-film motif to comment upon the horror film genre (this device is more extensively used in the "Scream" trilogy, which I recommend to fans of "Demons"). Also well-used is the claustrophobic movie theater setting. The film is gory and violent, with some real gross-out elements. Although the film's imagery can be absurd, at its best it is exciting, inventive, and genuinely horrific.
__label__1 Get them individually in volumes: like it says if i bought all the episodes on the 16 volumes instead of the waaaay to overpriced complete set right now id only pay about $120 which to me is waaay more reasonable then this guy's $1,999 piece of crap!
__label__2 The Fat Fallacy: This is a great book, I couldn't put it down. The recipes are delicious and I have been enjoying cooking and eating real food. The author comments on each recipe which I found helpful. I read it quickly and have returned to it several times to look things up and use the recipes. I highly recommend it!
__label__1 If you are gluten intolerant, avoid this product!: The label on the container says "gluten free", but like a lot of things, if you have problems with gluten intolerance then check the ingredient label. There you will find wheat and barley grasses, which in of themselves do not trigger reactions, but can contain seeds, which are the source of the gluten. Are you going to tell me they catch every seed that goes through?I bought this as an addition to my morning protein shake and from the first day I started using it I felt HORRIBLE! Fatigue, diarhea, nausea, all the symptoms that told me I had consumed something with gluten. I finally tracked down the only possible culprit, which is this product. ANYTHING that includes any form of wheat or barley is not safe to eat for a person with gluten issues. The fast and loose labeling protocols for the food industry have once again done us a great disservice.
__label__2 Reba did it again!: What a Great album. I am a Reba fan and have been for several years. I own ALL of her albums, yes all of them, even those hard to find Mercury Records on Vinyl. ANd this one is my favorite. There are so many different emotions, and Reba's delightful voice will take you on an incredible journey: If you don't already own it, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Too Vague: I read this book at the local Barnes & Nobles. I thougt I was getting something out of it because the ideas the author was talking about sounds very interesting.I was greatly disappointed because throughout the entire book, I found no actual example of dialogues, NONE. It's like saying "BE frindly at first every you meet a person" and it does not tell you how to be friendly nor any example of conversation.Don't waste your money, I recommend this one instead:Conversationally Speaking : Tested New Ways to Increase Your Personal and Social Effectivenessby Alan GarnerThanks for reading
__label__1 Not a fan: I did not like this dvd one bit. To do the workout you have to repeat each segment the allotted number of times which is really a pain in the rear. I disliked this dvd so much I am turning around and selling it. There also way too much talking. If I wanted talking I would just turn on the tv and sit on my butt.
__label__2 Very Well Done: We really enjoyed this movie. Intrigue with a little sex and suspense thrown in for good measure. I would definitely recommend it!
__label__1 I could have wrote this book....: My husband and I are potentially going to relocate on a expat basis to China. We have never been to China and know very little about the country. I purchased this book in anticipation that it would be "an indipensable cross cultural guide to working and living in china". It was a complete and total joke. The book was full of fluff and completely vague. It totally lacked any specific examples pertaining to not only China but being an expat in general. Seriously, I could have wrote this book it contained such little information. I guess you get what you pay for, and this book was cheap. I did not watch the dvd, so my comments are limited to the book only.
__label__1 Yeccch!! --not the real Roller Derby at all!: Only a portion of this "documentary" deals with Roller Derby in its beginnings. At a certain point the whole video shifts to the "Roller Games" which was nothing but a sideshow with some good skaters. No mention of the real Roller Derby is made again. Don't bother. Instead try to find "Derby"--a real documentary about the real thing on vhs, the books "Five Strides on the Banked Track" and "Roller Derby to RollerJam" tell the whole story.
__label__2 Guess I've Just Plain Grown Used to Stanley Tape Measures: I really don't consider myself an old time construction man yet... But I have been using Stanley 30' Tapes for 26 years now. Nothin else feels right. Even when Stanley came up with bigger and better, the Powerlock 30' is what I buy and will continue to buy, for a good piece of time to come. The only reason I gave this tool just 4 Stars is that I can beat tools up pretty bad and they just CAN'T last forever. Stanley will give ya a good run for your money though.
__label__2 Electrolux S Vacuum Bags: Bags are great and do well what they are intended for. Price is also great. Will buy again!
__label__2 Philips 8-inch picture frame: Bought it for my parents so they could have all the pictures of their grandchild in one place.This thing is amaizing. The picture quality is outstanding, the pictures look as if their backlit. Dark pictures seem to be brighter than normal prints. The internal memory is bigger than I thought it would be too. I loaded over 80 pics on it and there was still room for more, plus it has the card reader slots.There were only two things I didn't like. One is the croping feature in the philips software. It gives you a fixed croping box that can't be adjusted. I just used a different program to crop the pictures, then loaded them to the frame. The second was that it didn't tell you how much of the internal memory you had used as you were loading pictures, so I didn't know how much room was still available.Highly recomended. i'll probalby get one for myslef.
__label__2 Great movie! As enjoyable as the TV series.: 100% like the TV series. Great music, witty dialogue, funny jokes, etc. My 6 year old daughter, her 12 year old cousin, and my wife and I (early 30's) really enjoyed this.
__label__1 improperly assembled: Combined this with the ho turntable drive motor for remote operation. Recommend running the drive motor on 5vdc not 12vdc for reduced noise.Track contacts resemble motor brushes and were assembled improperly leading to a dead track after a few turns of the table. Fortunatly the deck comes off easily when installed in layout.
__label__2 Nice Brushes: What can you say about Oral B except they clean the teeth of America! My wife loves her Brush and these are waiting in the wings.
__label__2 Best Watch I Ever Owned: I purchased this wath from amazon a year ago (1/08). This is the best watch I have ever owned. It is sporty, yet elegant. I got comments about it when I first bought it. It has a number of different functions, including a stop watch, 4 alarms, 30min countdown, and alternative country times. The watch fits my wrist like a glove. The band is durable, hardly ever leaves any impression marks on my skin, and does not itch or make my wrist sweat. For the price, you absolutely can't find a better watch anywhere.
__label__2 great sound: This was a great purchase, bought it for my husband's birthday, he loves them. Says the sound is fantastic. Good price and great sound
__label__2 SO EXCITED to have this cd again!: I grew up on acapella music and sang acapella for years. This group is AWESOME! Some of the members of this group were in a group called "The Music Makers" many years ago and they were AMAZING then. It was really great to know that they were still singing and had fine tuned their musical abilities. If you like acapella music, you will LOVE this cd!
__label__1 UK Hard-Rock Heavy Metal Band: Its confusing to have 2 bands around with the exact same name and with a very similar logo. I much prefer the US Band Hangnail. If you like Heavy Duty Rock with a throw back feel to some of the most well known UK heavy metal bands of the 70's and 80's this album is for you. If you were expecting the US punkish style melodic rock Hangnail it isn't. It's OK but not my style.
__label__2 Awesome CD: On John Corbett's website, they say it best "listen to the music first".This is not just another CD from an actor turned singer. Dont judge it before you take a listen! Once you do, you will no doubt love it as much as I do. The man is talented, and you can hear in his voice the passion he has for singing, and when you check him out live you can see the passion he has for performing.Although I do love all the tracks, a few that really stand out are Good To Go, Bottle of Whiskey, Revival, Wichita and Simple Man.So wether you are a fan of John Corbett the actor or not (and yes, I am), I know you will be a fan of John Corbett the singer!
__label__1 Hurts so Bad: This movie is an absolute waste of time. I thought it was going to be awesome because it won an Oscar, but it is just the same old Hollywood dribble. I don't know how it beat Avatar for best film. OH wait, the producer emailed all his hollywood friends begging them to vote for his film.
__label__2 adequate review book: Covers the topics needed for the MCAT quite well. Occasional factual errors, but that's probably to be expected in any review book. The practice problems are much more difficult than the problems on the actual MCAT, so don't let them dishearten you. Do problems from the practice MCATs put out by AMCAS instead.
__label__2 You will not be disappointed: An intelligent and credible adaptation of one of Hitchcock's best, that borrows a few plot elements from North by Northwest. Very entertaining.
__label__2 WOW: Black Witch Project"It Will Scare The Sh*t Out Of You" - XXL MagazineA group of military rejects go on a retreat to find themselves, while in the process they notice how spooky and strange the camp becomes. Point blank a mad killer is on the loose. This real-life horror stars DEC-T (Hell 2 The Naw), Tracy Johnson (Hell 2 The Naw), also Rick Edwards (Bar-Be-Q / Hell 2 The Naw), and Sly-Man Carter (Bar-Be-Q / Hell 2 The Naw and To Have And To Hold).
__label__2 A must watch: I still don't know why I don't own this movie.If you haven't seen this movie; stop what your doing and watch it.Because this movie is worth your time.I would recommend you buy it rather then rent it, even if you haven't seen it before.It is a feat of strength to dislike this movie.Highly recommend it for owning and renting.
__label__2 Black Jelly Beans: I purchased Black Jelly Beans for a shipment overseas to Portugal. It seems they have a problem getting Jelly Beans. Not because they caint, but because they are just so darn expensive, enter Amazon! It was very reasonable for the amount you got and the delivery was very quick, like 2 days later. Unfortunitly I could not get the deliver to this address to accept my addy, so the US postal service came to the rescue with their "If it fits it ships" slogan....lol. Anyway I recommend the Beans they where great I am told by my friend in Portugal.
__label__2 One of my all time best. I highly recommend it.: Great main character with an actioned packed plot. Can't wait for the movie. When is the next book coming out ?
__label__1 Should have read other reviews!: I ordered this cable as I need a longer cable to reposition my PS2. I thought this looked like just what I needed and the quality looked great. I hooked up the cable and as the other reviews state, the the plugs are extremely tight and very hard to get on the the tv jacks. Once I did get everything hooked up, the cable did not work properly. The signal for the sound worked fine but the video signal did not work at all. I tried reconnecting several times to no avail. Ended up returning the product. I wish I had read what others had said before ordering.
__label__2 Ya gotta love it: I absolutely love this player. This is my first MP3 player and it is so easy to use. It is small enough that I can clip it onto my pocket or slip it inside. The song quality is great and the software is easy to understand when downloading. I thoroughly enjoy this product. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 GREAT!: I LOVE this hat! That said, I did see some similar, no-brand sun hats for adults and children at Costco, but didn't see a price. Might be cheaper, but not quite as nice.I do love this hat, tho! Love the "shirt clip" that keeps it from getting blown away, too!
__label__2 wonderful: I bought it for my 6 month old but my 3 year old simply loves it, too! We've watched many sign language videos and this one seems to be very comprehensive and fun to watch.
__label__1 not the best book by Ann Rule: not her best and I wonder if she should not have written it at all since she obviously didn't have enough material for a real book. She just keeps harping on the good guys being so good and the bad guys being so bad without much detail to back it up. Sad. I thought I-5 Killer, Dead by Sunset, and Everything she ever Wanted were fabulous.
__label__1 SOPORIFIC TALENT: If Candida were given parchment and pen, she would have at least produced a book of poetry to delight the lowest senses, this book by Ms. McClanahan, on the other hand, appeals to no senses at all. What lack of utter passion, and utter lack of intellectual activity these poems have! To the lions, to the lions of obscurity these poems must be banished. Not recommended at all.
__label__1 awful!: The blue screwdriver had blue residue coming off of it and onto my hands. The bits were made so poorly that they were shredding when used. The reason I bought it was to use the 3-sided bit for the Nintendo ds. THE BIT WAS TOO BIG!!! It had the advertisement of the nintendo ds on it's discription and it would not work! The bit was so fragile that tiny bits of metal (If that is what it was made of)were everywhere. I definately would NOT recommend this to anyone. Next time I will spend more money for something better.
__label__2 great movie and film style: this movie was a raw and gripping story of Alice and the day to day drama in her life. it is simple, real and all the actors give great performance, this is a great drama movie i love it. the ending is a little bad for me though since it leaves you wondering!
__label__1 Typical cheap chinese product: Fairly cheap flimsy construction.One of these units appears to work (though its sensitivity to motion seems to be variable). The 2nd unit just comes on, goes off, comes on, goes off repeatedly whenever it detects motion. It never stays "full on".
__label__1 heavy and boring: A waste of money. My daughter has had this in her basket of toys since birth - she is now 9 months old - and has never been interested in it for more than ten seconds. The thing is too heavy and cumbersome to be entertaining in any way. As mentioned by others, you really have to shake the thing hard to hear the giggle. And it is not even a pleasant sound. But the worse aspect of the toys is that is is so heavy that if a baby holds it while laying on her back, and then drops it, it is a mighty big thump on her face. This happened to my daughter once and it did hurt her. I definitely don't recommend this ridiculous toy.
__label__2 A Great Resource for Goat Breeders!: This is the best book that I have found for goat husbandry! The advise is sound, the book is easy to read and it covers most questions about how to raise goats, from how to feed them, breed them and house them to how to raise and sell the kids. Up to date, and enjoyable. A must have for any livestock library!
__label__2 helpful: This CD set gives a good perspective about how to make a business work. Some of the philisophical stuff in the middle of this set is off - but other than that, it has a lot of good ideas and nuggets. I'd recommend combining Gerber's ideas with other good business authors, like Lencioni.
__label__2 Best Money spent: I never write reviews for a product, but this one made me. I have had this product for about 3 months and use it twice a day. It makes the best protein shakes you have ever had. If you are looking for a great shake maker, look no further. Its small but still can make a double shake no problem. Add some chocolate protein and a frozen bananna and its better than frosty from wendys, I kid you not. Awesome product dont hesitate to purchase.
__label__2 The Ultimate Classic: With a soundtrack done not by Queen, but the band called America, The Last Unicorn was a film that entrances me as much now as it did when I was a child. Beautiful little touches, such as the "Tree's Love" and "Robin Hood Illusion" make this such a heart-tearing film.
__label__1 Completely Awful: This book is utterly tasteless and disgusting. There's a bunch of gore, weird bitchy people, and child abuse. I thought the abuse of the little kid was sick and twisted, and that all the characters were boring and only there to be killed off. It just makes me think that the (cross-dressing) author of this book is a bit off in the head to even come up with this sort of disgusting thing. It's not like I haven't read/seen violent/gory books/movies, I've seen alot and read alot of horror, but this was utterly tasteless. I just couldn't get into it.
__label__1 Oscars Don't Prove Anything: This movie is plain weird like all movie musicals. I still don't get what its about and I will not ever see it again because I don't want to know what its about. This movie is just plain dumb and terrible if you ask me. And why is it that SO many boring, and strange, movies are nominated for Oscars all the time? It just doesn't make any since! The Lord of the Rings and The Pianist were the ONLY two good movies nominated for Oscars. Chicago got its share of VERY undeserved Oscars. This is the worst movie of 2002! Don't bother wasting your money on buying this garbage. Chicago is a very BAD and BORING movie.GRADE: F- out of an A+
__label__1 waste of money: This ebook is totally useless. There is no indexing for essays. There is no critique of any of the essays. Most of the essays are poorly written.I wasted my 30$s on this book. In my view, it's not even worth 2 dollars.PS: This is my first review on amazon. I am not into writing reviews. But this book is so horrible that I felt the urge to let the world know.. :-).
__label__2 The Only Garden Book I've Read Cover to Cover!: The original blurb I read about this book was misleading. I thought it was going to be about using unusual containers. I bought it for my sister. Now I have to get her another one. I started reading it and read it cover to cover. It was great! Very practical, imaginative, and common sensical. I wish I had had this when I was actually living in Tacoma, WA. But you don't have to live in the Pacific Northwest to derive a great deal of benefit from this book. I am putting some of her suggestions to use and in 3 short weeks am already seeing the difference they make. Thanks for writing this book!
__label__1 Dimplex compact electric stoe: I had to return it. It was terrible. Did not heat very well at all. Waste of time and money.
__label__1 So UNCOMFORTABLE for the baby. BULKY and HARD to use.: My daughter is 40 days old. As soon as I laid her in the sling and had the sling in carrying position I could see that she was very uncomfortable.Contour of your stomach is not FLAT but CURVED. It tilts my daughter's spine SIDEWAYS when she is lying flat in the sling. It's just not a comfortable position for the baby.The video teaches you how to carry the baby in different ways. However, they are useless if the baby is an infant and can't support her neck on her own.Besided, it is BULKY and HARD to use. I am returning it.
__label__1 Horrible, absolutly worthless: This book is poorly organized, poorly written, its paced way to fast to be called "Beginner", plenty of code is given but its poorly explained. I read the whole book over 1 week and I know about as much as I did before I picked it up. I just got back from returning it.If you are already a cpp guru and a directx guru, then this might be for you. But no one else.The 2 authors credentials in teaching and knowledge of the topic sure dont show through in this book.
__label__2 A WOMAN WHO CERTAINLY DOES KNOW!: Being a huge fan of Natalie Cole's but not a huge fan of jazz, I was sort of apprehensive about buying this cd. But, after one complete listen, I must say it is a joy. Her voice can be one part seductive, one part gritty, one part, playful, one part tearful....she is simple DIVINE! This is an album with very few fast paced songs....this one is one to listen to on a rainy day with a loved one and candles....to me all the songs are standouts in their own way! If you want to escape into her world...go for it! If you want all upbeat songs, this one may dissapoint you....
__label__1 Does not work well at all. Stay away...cheaply made.: This cable was a waste of money. I spend a lot of hours trying to figure out what the problem was with my connection. It would work one time and then not work another. I thought it was my internet. I switched out cables and found this to be the problem. The more I learned the more I realized that this cable has no insulation and is not twisted. I suggest that you don't cheap yourself on this like I did. Check monoprice.com for decent cheap cable (go with cat6). (no, I am not an affiliate).
__label__1 POOR PERFORMANCE, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!: I purchased this blanket approximately 4 months ago and just began receiving an E 4 message. I am no longer able to shut the blanket off with the control, I had to unplug it from the wall electrical outlet.When I spoke to the manufacturer, I was informed that this is "normal" once the message appears (??). I was also told that I could continue to use the other side of the blanket with the other control, and "everything will be fine." And even though it has a five year warranty, when I return the blanket to them, they will not refund my money nor replace my blanket, only repair it. Right, like I am going to get a decent nights sleep knowing that there is definitely an electrical problem.I would NOT recommend this blanket for purchase.
__label__2 One thumb waaay up.: Leo Africanus was one of the more engaging historical fiction books I have ever read. The author did an excellent and very thorough reseacrh job. The text flows very nicely and the language is exquisite. All in all, a wonderful read.
__label__1 Informative, but disappointing: In spite of the low rating, I'd still suggest it to an inexperienced photographer who got an s100 or s110 as a first camera. It covers the details of good shooting (framing, exposure, composition) with very concrete examples, and will certainly help someone find reasons to try all of the nifty features of the camera.However, the S200 is the "current" camera in that line, and the book needs an update, though the general features are still applicable.The *real* disappointment is that this is a black-and-white printing, with velobind-style binding -- nice in that it lays flat, but I can do as well or better in any copy shop off of a web page. The example pictures do lose a lot (the captions indicate that the authors are aware of this, and explain in words, but really, I want a book, not excuses.)I can't fault the writing - I just wish it had been produced with more quality; magazine style, perhaps...
__label__2 Awesome!: These are very well crafted. They make finding my spices so much easier. I would recommend these to anyone with limited cupboard space.
__label__2 9x13 stainless steel chimney cap: The product is middle grade quality. expected for the price, and worked fine for my use.Shipping was very fast.The only issue I had was cleaning out all the styrofoam peanuts wedged in the screeningfor packaging.
__label__1 Barely audible: I wanted a wired headset because all the bluetooth headsets I tried with my iPhone proved unreliable. That's probably more a problem with the iPhone than the headsets.s The design of the Plantronics is attractive but it is barely loud enough to be heard in the house, let alone in a car. The headset that came with the iPhone must be 4 or 5 time louder. It is difficult to believe that this is the best a company with a reputation like Plantronics could do.
__label__2 yeah, it's great, but: i agree with the positive reviews, but in terms of lyrical or conceptual originality . . . "crown of creation", for example, was a direct cop from a john brunner novel named (i think, it's been a while) "rebirth", while "triad" was david crosby lifting ideas from robert heinlein's classic "stranger in a strange land". still a great album, though.
__label__1 Worst strategy guide ever!: This strategy guide stinks! I've never seen a guide so full of useless information. They should just have the website listed in the instruction manual for all the good the guide does you. No hints, very few tips on bosses. I personally don't want to have to pause my game every few minutes and go online just to figure out what I need to do. It should be in the guide. Who cares if it's longer? The guide for FF 7 and FF 8 were far better because they told you everything you needed to know. This one should to.
__label__2 Angels, Demons, and School Bullies: Guard your nipples against the corpse-ified bullies of yore: that's what I learned! No, seriously this is an AMAZING book. As if one twist in the middle of the book(after some well-built suspense) wasn't enough to make the story seem grandiose, another twist near the end comes along and makes it epic.We return to an old character in this volume(which is genius, of course; cliffhangers SUCK!!) and meet a new one. The best thing is, you sympathize with ALL gaiman's characters(even the mischevious ones). And more references to mythology and even art are thrown in, as expected (watch Susano-o-makoto's expressions and poses).Excellent volume, Mr. Gaiman! I'll get 5 on my next paycheck, but for now I'm working on American Gods!! :)
__label__2 Great CD!: I just got this for my birthday and I love it! It's so much fun and has some good songs to dance to. I think Jump5 is great because their songs about things I can relate to and not all about love and such. It's nice to hear a song and wonder about the lyrics. I can't wait for their new album! You should hear "We Are Family"! It's great and vote for it on Radio Disney!
__label__2 I'd rather sit at Home watching these amazing scenes than a vacation.: The stunning aerial shots of earth are just breath taking, sheer beauty, jaw dropping, especially in 1080p, makes BBC's Planet Earth look like an archive. The pelican shot, and the small bird flying over the massive waterfall are just priceless.However, the never ending depressing narration (Glenn Close) on how we are destroying our planet is like forcing me to eat tarnished caviar. Multiple times she repeats, "faster, and faster, we are destroying our home earth." Sure there's light at the end of the movie, like the last 5 minutes worth, but sitting thru to get there made me rather hang myself. Solution: just cut out the audio, and play your favorite classical tunes is an ideal substitute. Rejoice, our Home is always awesome. If you did actually like the audio propaganda, you may also like The Inconvenient Truth (Al Gore), which BTW is better narrated.
__label__1 It was o.k.: this was a pretty good book expected i expected more! it said in the add WINNING and it wasnt really the kind you act out on stage with they were the kind you express yourself or make up a little play for your friends and that is not what i expected i was very disappointed because now i have to find a new book.
__label__1 Poor recorded sound: I just opened the Colby CD250 and heard some great sounds from CD, cassette and radio. But recording them was another story. When recording from a CD,a big hiss can be heard between tracks and during soft sounds of the songs. The unit is supposed to have a volume leveler. It does not. The sound quality of recorded music from CD or radio is very poor. It plays back distorted and, if from CD, the hiss I mentioned before. The unit is good for tapes recorded elsewhere, CDs and radio. But if you want a unit to record CDs or radio, get something else.
__label__1 Fool me once, shame on you....: We were originally very pleased with this coffeemaker and thought the idea was unique. It did seem to work well for the first year. And then we lost the ability to program the clock. Since this was once of the more important features (programmed brew time), we ran down to our discount store and purchased another. Within a very short time, we noticed that the timer seemed unreliable but would be "fixed" by unplugging and resetting the clock. This happened several times, but not with enough consistency to throw out the coffee maker. We reached one year and 5 days on the second coffeemaker before the clock/timer malfunctioned and it would no longer brew. Needless to say, we have chosen a different coffee maker this time and truly feel that there is something wrong with the clock assembly. Customers should be able to expect a coffeemaker to last longer than a year. I would not buy this coffeemaker unless you just like to replace your coffeemaker every year!
__label__1 Average,but a Heck of a Marketed Group: I only liked a Little of Pearl Jam back when they were Hot in the early 90's as part of the Seattle scene&Sound. Eddie Veddar was the focal Point of the Band. in truth there wasn't alot of edge to there Music,but they Hit with some songs that made you think a Little Bit. now Pearl Jam's true Legacy is the OffSpring of :Hootie&the BlowFish,Stone Temple Pilots,Creed&Knickleback all Acts sound like Pearl Jam Knockoffs. that to me is there Impact. they pretty much peaked out after 1994.
__label__2 An Australian's View Point: This book shocked, amazed, awed and inspired me. Mr Smith has written a superb account of one of the most devastating events in the history of America.Given the option, I would give him the Nobel Prize for Literature.My copy of it will be read, again and again.
__label__1 Revisionist history: It is a historical fact that the Jews have fared much better and had greater freedom under Islamic rule than under Westerners, the Europeans. It has always been Christian Europe that persecuted the Jews throughout the middle ages and beyond. Study the Inquisition, Crusades, Holocaust; The current conflict is political. Both Christian and Muslim Palestinians have grievances with the current state of affairs regarding Israel. This book is written by a Christian fundamentalist who twists the facts to suit his own world view that the second coming of Christ HAS to occur in a God protected Israel.
__label__1 Overpriced for what you get: Hated this thing as soon as I opened it. Not nearly as "shiny" as it was in the pic and the stones don't sparkle at all. The ring looks dull, plating has chipped off in some places and the stones look terrible (always have though).I ended up going to Khols and getting a ring for $10 that is much more attractive and people actually ask if its real.It amazes me that there are so many people who love this item; maybe I just got a dud or they have never gotten a ring out of one of those quarter machines and think this thing is great..
__label__1 Not All There: The Cat's Fancy is a story of a cat that is in love with her owner. She is given until Halloween to get him to tell her human form, that he loves her. Maggie (both the cats name and the humans name) shows up naked and willing to do almost anything to get her owner, Nicholas, to say he loves her. The characters for Maggie and Nicholas lack luster and true desire for one another. There was too much "cat" in Maggie character and not enough real man in Nicholas. The only real redeeming bit of this novel are the sister and best friend characters (Deena and Hoop). Deena is the magic loving artist that knows Maggie for what she really is, while Hoop is the lovable best friend that just wants whatever it is to keep Nicholas happy. I've read a number of books by Julie Kenner and this is not one of her better stories.
__label__2 Nice back brush: I am very pleased with this back brush. The handle might have been a little longer but this is not a major problem. The bristles are just right for me, not too stiff but stiff enough to get my circulation going. I also use it on my arms and legs and leave the bath tub feeling invigorated. It's nice to know I have a clean back. I'm glad I bought it.
__label__2 Great book!!!!!!!: this is one of the greatest book i have ever read it about this girl named Susannah Simon. she has to move to california were she will have to live because her mom got marrie to Andy and he lives there. Susannah is a mediator which is someone who can speak and feel ghost. Soon she find that a ghost named Jesse lives in her room who actually died there.As she gets to know Jesse a there is a nother ghost who has revenge in her mind and Susannah is in her way.this is a great ook. if you liked the other books writen by Meg Cabot you would really like this one. if you do then there are more books about Susannah and her ghost people.1. shadowland2. ninth key3. haunted4. darkest hour5. reuion6. twilight
__label__2 Boston Cleaner: Good product, good price, good service. (Ain't that enough?) Word, Word, Word, Word, Word, on, at, to, by, cat, dog.
__label__2 Slow start, nail biting finish: This was a very exciting book. A real nail biter to the end. Unfortunately, it took over 100 pages to get started, but Crichton is such a good writer it didn't matter to much. I found myself gasping and throwing up my hands every time the historians got into another situation. It kept me on the edge of my chair, and I agreed with the ending.
__label__2 Suns of Scorpio: This is the second book in the Dray Prescot adventure series on the planet Kregen under the suns of Antares. In this the Star Lords project Dray onto the coast of Turismond at the entrance to the Eye of the World, where the Zairians and the ziggurat building Grodnims battle over the dominance of the Red and Green suns. He rescues a couple and then becomes involved in the eternal conflict of this inner sea. In adventure on adventure Ken Bulmer writing as Alan Burt Akers reveals this world of monsters, heroic deeds, and Alien races. This book is also available with the other first five novels of the series in the newly reprinted inThe Saga of Dray Prescot: The Delian Cycle (The Saga of Dray Prescot), The dangers are intense, the rewards immense and suspense unending. Hi Jikai!
__label__2 A surprisingly good effort: This Boney M album was released in the 80s and definitely has a different, more modern sound than their previous 70s albums. It is a surprisingly good effort, with some very catchy tunes like "Happy Song" and "Barbarella Fortuneteller". It should've been a hit but wasn't.
__label__1 Somewhat useful, but far from comprehensive: After hearing many people tell me how great this book was I finally bought it. While it has been somewhat useful in finding the readings for some names, it is far from being "A Comprehensive Index" of Japanese names. Less than half of the names I try to look up in it are even listed, and the way the kanji are indexed is not intuitive (even to someone familiar with radicals and stroke-count indices).I would only recommend this to someone who doesn't have access to a real name dictionary from Japan, but don't count on it to be "comprehensive" in any sense of the word. It's not even close.
__label__2 Another Soul Classic Indeed: WOW! I thought she could not do better then "Who is Jill Scott:Words and Sounds Vol 1", but she exceeded by expectations.This is definitedly on of those disc you can play from start to finish with out skipping (although I can play "Golden" a thousand times over. It's the jam!. Hands down this is an R&B; Soul Classic to enjoy for years to come.
__label__2 The Glory of 84'!!!!!: In my opinion the defining moment of metal in the 80s.Yes there certainly are a number of great bands from that era of metal but I believe Maiden not only peaked as a band on this effort but topped the genre.This is an immaculate product for that time,way ahead of its time and still to this day as good,if not better than anything that has followed by any hard rock or metal band.Musically precise and artistically genius.Need I mention Dickinson's vocal performance on this effort.A flawless 5 Star across the board.Call me nostalgic but when this was first released in 84'I purchased it on audio cassette and knew at that time that history was made....
__label__1 Good Material for Starting a Fire with a Firestone: Got this book as a Christmas gift at my request because I, like a great many other people, waited a long, long, long time for the fifth book to appear. How do I tell my son what a horrendous waste of his money this book was! I have read the other reviews so I won't go into great detail. The one-star reviews said it all for me. Don't want to risk being as REPETITIVE as the author. However, quoting P.T. Barnum, "There's a sucker born every minute". How true...I'm one of them. Terrible book. If you feel you must read it, get it at the library.
__label__1 good material, but...: Good material, but the specification on the amazon page was not clear that won't fit the creative m microphoto. The mp3 dances inside the case. Anyway it was cheap. I advice you to buy the protective cases from the manufacturer.
__label__2 Works well: Definately alot more work than a mechanical aerator, but it works as intended. A wide steel toe workboot fits on the platform and the padded handles work well for someone 6 feet tall. It doesn't take stomping, but rather just pushing body weight (195 lbs) onto the tool and it sinks flush to the ground.The paint / coating wears off quickly from the prongs, but I would expect that. You also need to clean out the prongs with a screwdriver or the dirt will harden and block the plugs in subsequent use.Don't plan on doing a big yard in one day. It is manual labor, so spreading the work out over several days/weeks is a suggestion for success.
__label__2 marley magic on dvd: This dvd is great! I would recommend this dvd to all bob marley fans.But not just bob marley.With performances by Peter Tosh, Dennis Brown, Jacob Miller, Marcia Griffiths, And others.This dvd also includes the 1978 "One Love Peace Concert",featuring Bob Marley. With songs like, "Natty Dread", "War","Jah live", and "Jammin'". This dvd is simply great. Even though the sound quality and picture isn,t that great but brings my rating down to four stars.This is still a great dvd though.
__label__2 It's hot, Eddie's drank all the lemoande, what will Maisy do: If you are the parent of a young child, you probably know who Maisy is. She's a mouse with a duck, a squirrel, an elephant, and a crocodile for friends. Why the crocodile isn't trying to eat the others is beyond me, but that's life in Maisy's world.Both of my daughters love the Maisy books; there's something about their simple stories and colorful pictures that even appeals to adults. The books are short and easy to read. But, the stories are never obnoxiously simplistic, like so many other books for small children.Maisy's enjoying a cool drink when Eddie decides to slurp it all up. What will Maisy and Eddie do? I guess I've read enough of these to my children that I'm developing favorites. This is one I always seem to enjoy reading to the kids and, as usual, they love it too.
__label__1 Needs Mac software too: Foolish these days to market a product only for PC users. Macintosh users are rapidly increasing. To ignore this market is foolhardy.I would buy this, if it came with Mac software. Without it, it is just another BP monitor.
__label__1 New Age Bull: I know this is suppose to be a really good book for giving a person some so called positive outlook on life. New Age material doesn't work.
__label__2 Music for the move: This is a wonderfull album from James Taylor Quartet. It's a must in the acid jazz field.
__label__2 Best Placebo Album To Date: I don't typically review CD's on-line, so this will be brief. I'm giving this a five for one reason: I'm on buying this CD for the 2nd time because I wore out my first copy. Enough said.
__label__2 great gift: Our son loved this blanket. It was just what he wanted. I had looked eveywhere for a blanket like this on, was very happy when it came and it was such nice quality.
__label__1 Not ALL that...: Maybe I lost the Joke or maybe I was expecting another Invader Zim, I don't know, but this isn't as great as everybody make it sound like.I wasn't able to laugh even once (and I love sadistic jokes about life and destine).I must say that Satan and his son are the best thing in the book (this and the meanwhiles) but Squee it self is not that funny.
__label__2 it's a fantastic experience: The audio set is a great way for kids and the whole family to listen to the story of Narnia together. The full-cast drama features film quality sound and music. And it is true! It gave you an extraordinary listening experience that's not the same as either reading books or watching films, but equally exciting! And If you like the book series or one of the movies, I recommend this audio set to you and your family. And If you have kids don't like to read Narnia and spend all their time digging Harry Potter, It's not because Harry Potter is better written or anything, it's just better marketing. Try this audio-set to catch their attention and I promise your kids must fall in love with Narnia!
__label__1 a bad misstep: It's hard to believe this is a Kurosawa film. Other reviewers have liked it but is a pale shadow of the magnificent Yojimbo. Everything that made the latter great is missing.Mifune just shows up. No buildup.The young men he helps out aren't worth his time and all are faceless.The villains are all the same. Not one is memorable. Even the great Tatsuya Nakadai, so outstanding in Yojimbo, has no personality at all. His death, though, is "interesting."The terrible comedy weakens whatever plot there is. It advances the story in Yojimbo, though, and Daisuke Kato, as Nakadai's older brother, is hilarious though he doesn't mean to be.And, worse of all, there's no one to root for.Skip this and get Stray Dog, a Kurisawa film finally getting the credit due it. It is one of kurosawa's four or five greatest films and has been overlooked for nearly fifty years.
__label__2 It's an excellent Palm manual's companion !: It's simply and excellent book with lots of information, programs (in the enclosed CD), tips and tricks. It's the perfect companion for you and your Palm !
__label__1 I paid $100. I paid $100 too much.: My RioVolt SP150 is a good MP3 player. That's basically all I use it for. I have it hooked up to my stereo so I can play my MP3 CD's, but I play my Audio CD's in the stereo itself.When I take the Volt on the road, it works fine, except the batteries I use only give me about eight hours of power. I wish I could buy a remote, but alas, Rio's website offers no such item. Nor does it offer any AC adapter.My advice, if you only have a hundred bucks, get a RioVolt. I would suggest buying a different model, like the SP350 (Which comes with a remote).But if you have a little more money, like $300, get an iPod.
__label__2 Hoodlum: This movie is a good example of the hard times suffered in the cities during the early thirties when brut force was the only laws.People had to survive the times they lived in.
__label__1 run as far away as possible: this tripod is terrible. I can hold the camera steadier in my hands. at $22.99 it is about $34.89 to expensive. I can not describe how flimsy this is, it is not even worth buying it as a throw in the trunk emergency backup tripod (which is what I bought it for).
__label__2 One of the best horror films of all time: I've read reviews before saying The Evil Dead ils overrated. If anything, it's underrated. The first film in the Evil Dead trilogy is one of the best horror films of all time. Army of Darkness is the other great movie in the trilogy, just as good as The Evil Dead. I thought Evil Dead 2 was overrated. For a super low budget, The Evil Dead still comes out looking more realistic and superb. I've read that The Evil Dead was filmed in Morristown, Tennessee. Where Exactly?
__label__2 Nikon D70s 18-70 mm lens - used: Camera and lens arrived in well protected packaging. Equipment performance was as if they were bought new. No scratches on the lens, no scuff marks or other problems with camera body. Hardware and software worked as described in manual. Two memory cards, rechargeable battery, camera strap, camera and lens cap all provided with camera plus lens deal. Great value for money and saved 100's dollars if bought new. I would not hesitate to purchase from this seller again. The only disappointment was that no tracking info was provided when requested, this made it difficult to determine precise delivery day/time.
__label__2 Entertaining kid flick!: We bought this movie for my son for Christmas & he loves it. It is entertaining & he will actually sit through the whole movie! (which is rare for him because he is only 3 years old!) There is only one part in the movie I think they could of left out. It's the scene where the guy & girl are in the car & the girl is making advances toward the guy but he isn't having none of it. I think that was a little inappropriate for a kids cartoon. That is why I only gave it 4 stars. Otherwise I would of gave it 5 stars. All in all I would recommend this movie to anyone that has children. A great movie to pop in on family movie night!
__label__2 Me parece un "VIDEO MUSICAL" de larga duración muy bien hech: La verdad es una de mis cantantes favoritas, pero hay que decir que el "concierto", no parece ser una interpretación en vivo. Es un doblaje de voz y audio grabados en un estudio. Parece que están interpretando en vivo, pero no es así. La calidad es muy buena, pero desgraciadamente no representa ni por mucho lo que es un "verdadero concierto" de Sarah y su banda en vivo. No hay contacto visual, ni se siente la energía de la gente durante la interpretación del mismo. Creo que para apreciar su música está muy bien, puesto que deja escucharla. Los paneos son muy suaves, pero no se ve la potencia de interpretación, puesto que ni gota de sudor aparece en las caras de los músicos ni de la misma Sarah. Es por todo esto que le doy 4 estrellas. Debieron haber sacado un "Verdadero concierto" como el de VH-1. Sin embargo, lo recomiendo ampliamente.
__label__2 Beautifully short: I just received the book a couple of weeks ago and it is already my 21 month old son's new favorite. I love the beautiful illustrations and he seems to also. It is the perfect length for his age because there are only two lines per page and that is about as long as he is willing to wait before turning the page. The lyric style makes it a nice soothing pace that is great for bedtime.
__label__1 Not Impressed: I really should have paid closer attention to the negative feedback that this product was given. I purchased these sheets for $60 because they were featured on Amazon's "Today's Deals" and I thought I was getting a steal of a deal. What I actually got was basically a one-use disposable sheet set. They fit loose on the bed before washing them, they shrink in the wash, but do so to the point that they rip when you put them back on the bed. This I attribute to weak stitching at the seams. The smooth finish that they initally have coming out of the package is lost on the first wash also, and a woman's mascara is all that it takes to permanently stain them. I don't really care if my sheets wrinkle coming out of the dryer, which they did, but I do expect them to hold up to normal use. I am very surprised that a product of such poor quality is listed on such a good online shopping site.
__label__1 Hardware is Fair, Software is Riddled with Bugs: I am not a computer guru, I admit. But I do have a decent grip on modern technology. I purchased this IPAQ in the hopes that it could replace my paper calendar and my appointment book at home, while also allowing me to type term papers on it at school and keep good notes. But instead, all it does is keep track of my appointments at work. It freezes up often while using it and the battery lasts only a couple of hours on low power. It's absolutely rediculous. When you add in all the software bugs, like not being able to easily synchronize with more than one computer, and the machine becomes a time and money waste.This is not a handheld computer at all. I should have waited for better technology.
__label__1 Misinformation and inappropriate recommendations: I read the first several chapters of this book and found several errors and some misinformation. For example, the book warns that marathon runners raise their core temperature an average of 37.4 degrees farenheit. Really? My core temperature when running goes up to 134.9 degrees? Wow. The consulting doctor also gives a recommendation for women to only gain 20 - 25 pounds during pregnancy so they can go back to prepregnancy weight "at delivery". Not only does this go against the recommendations given by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (average weight gain of 25-35 pounds) but going back to prepregnancy weight is unhealthy and impractical for women, especially if they plan to breastfeed, in which case they NEED fat stores so that their milk is healthy. I will be returning this book and will go back to reading "The Pregnacy Book" by William and Martha Sears.
__label__2 Fabulous: It was above all expectations. I was very well pleased with it. 98% of the times I order from Amazon I am estatic about my purchases.
__label__1 Lost of power, engine service light came on, and stranded me: I was so impressed after reading about the 1 Million Mile Warranty, I ordered this filter for my 2008 Silverado 2500HD, Duramax 6.6L. Amazon 's fast delivery had it to me in 2 days. I was heading on a 500 mile road trip, and hoped this would help with fuel economy and performance. WRONG!Three miles down the road and the warning lights started, Engine Lost Power, Change Air Filter, Service Engine Soon, and then I was on the side of the road.Called H&N;, the rep stated that "some '08 Duramax will not except this filter, and I should return to the OEM Filter." THANKS! A little too late for that, after I'm out here dodging traffic without an OEM Filter in my glovebox.Removing the top access cover allowed me to limp back home and remove the problem cartridge.
__label__2 Good value: This is a powerful fan for your desk or a small room (say, no more than 11x11 ft). It has a wide turn radius, though it does not capture a wide area outside of the direct area of the fan blade (it is a small fan after all). It's fairly durable though it's a little worse for the wear after a recent move; It got banged around/dropped just a bit and now it catches slightly on both ends of it's oscillation range. This does not affect it's effectiveness but is something I noticed. On the whole it's a good value for what you pay and will definitely be a life saver on hot days.
__label__1 too predictable but still good: I finally got a chance to read this book, recommended by a local store clerk. Unfortunately, when I got to the chapter in which Eloise finds information that might help her find out who the Pink Carnation is, it was easy from then on for the reader to know who the Carnation was indeed. It was way too predictable. The story (of all these spies) *is* interesting, it's just too bad that Willig could not come up with other possibilities to tell the reader who the spy was. In the end, there was no twist, and the ending actually left me unsatisfied. No, I won't spoil it and tell you who is the Carnation, you will find out yourself when you read it. And no, I will not read the follow up of the book, The Masque of the Black Tulip.Despite this, Willig's writing is quite enjoyable, and the book reads very easily. If you like predictable novels, you'll definitely enjoy this one.
__label__1 Warning: Magic Decoder Ring Not Included: As a graduate student in history, I was intrigued by Sahlins subject. However, Sahlins does his best to hide his subject from any reader not in "the club" -- i.e. anyone who does not speak the jargon of a structuralist (or post-structuralist) anthropologist. Sahlins is a very inaccessible (and is thus, by most rules of writing, a BAD) writer, whose elitist attitude negates any interest I may have had in his subject matter.
__label__1 Mainly for Mitford Fans Already: Not as good as the other collections of Nancy Mitford's letters. The letters are edited to the point where the point of the letters is often lost and too many letters aren't included, for whatever reason, perhaps because of the shortness of the book. It is not particularly good editing to have one letter commenting on the amusing story contained in a letter from the other party when the letter with the amusing story isn't included. However, if you are already a Mitford fan, the book is still worth buying and reading.
__label__2 pretty happy: This pretty much works as advertised. The only issue I have is that sometimes the buttons don't do what I think they should. But this is a small and infrequent problem. The big picture is that it is small and light, stays in my ear, and has satisfactory sound quality. The mobile battery charger is sometimes quite useful. I am happy and would buy another one if need arose.
__label__2 Top Notch: A great find for Kolchak fans and even for ones new to the series. It is rare to find a collection of short stories where all the pieces are equally strong. There is not one weak link in this anthology.
__label__1 Worn Out: This series is worn out; there are no more fresh ideas. It was fun while it lasted but it's time to close the door on Replica.
__label__2 Great for kids and adults: My husband and I love this CD as much as our daughter does. It's great for her to nap to and us to unwind. We've heard it almost every day for 6 weeks and I haven't become sick of it yet. I think it's also great exposure to a culture different then our own with the tie in of people loving their children and expressing and nurturing them through song.
__label__1 Kind of strange: This book is kind of a strange book. Laura writes about her life and experiences. She sounds like a sweet person, and I really enjoyed reading about her. BUT, these tales were NOT funny at all! I mean, was this SUPPOSED to be a funny book? I didn't laugh even once while reading the book. It is a nice read - but if you really want to laugh with someone as he goes through life - get Jay Leno's book.
__label__2 The Best John lee Hooker album ever!: This John Lee Hooker album,it my opinion is his best overall single album,featuring new renditions of some of his best songs "Boogie Chillums", "Hobo Blues", "Crawling Kingsnake" mixed with some nice soulful full band arrangements without losing that great solo Hooker feel. Some of these particular versions wound up on the orginal "Blues Brothers" movie soundtrack! A Great introduction for peopel new to John Lee and an essential collection for the hardcore John Lee Hooker Fan like me!
__label__2 Gentle lead is a winner: I can now walk my 101.7 lb lab without being pulled around my neighborhood. This is the only product that works.
__label__2 The clip that failed on the Omron Pedometer: The pedometer itself is great and is everything I had hoped for. The clip to wear it on your belt is not very good. The clip portion is too short and the spring is not strong enough. If the clip was similar to the one on my cell phone, I would rate the pedometer 5+. If I try to play golf with it on my belt, it falls off, and it will even fall off sometimes when I bend over.
__label__2 Death in Grand Canyon: I picked this book up the day after I hiked South Kaibab, Tonto, Bright Angel (9 hours, 40 minutes)in late September, 2002. The Grand Canyon is truly amazing. The book chronicles all recorded deaths spanning hundreds of years and some of the stories read like pure fiction, you simply can't put it down. The chapter on freak accidents and venoumous creatures was a little disappointing but otherwise it was the most fascinating read of an actual place possible. It makes me want to go back and run the Colorado River (but not during monsoon season) to see some of the locations and rapids that have become both famous and notorious. I would definately recommend it for outdoor enthusiast and certainly for anyone planning a visit.
__label__2 Couldn't be happier!: This playpen is absolutely adorable! The colors are super bright, each of the bugs on the side panels have either a squeeker or mirror, etc. (Doesn't say that in product description.) It's spacious and sturdy and my eight-month-old loves it...she just keeps staring at the bright colors and smiling!
__label__2 Good in the office, less good on the plane: These headphones work very well for my purposes, but they won't satisfy everyone. Audio quality is good, but not great: compared to the open, clean sound of a pair of Grados these sound a little muffled and muddy. For my needs, the noise cancellation is great: window air conditioners, dehumidifiers, dishwashers, office ventilation systems are all virtually inaudible with the noise cancellation switched on. I've only used the headphones on airplanes a couple of times, and found them less satisfactory there. The QuietPoints help a lot, and jazz and rock are clearly audible. But quiet passages in classical music are still hard to hear, even with much of the plane's background hum cancelled out.
__label__1 Reading light will not work after less than a month.: I really liked the price. I bought this for the reading light option and loved it, till the reading light stopped working. I tried a new bulb, no luck. So I took it apart to see if there was a loose connection inside, but no luck there either. Mine could just be a one of those that it just happened to. I did not take the chance again, bought a different kind somewhere else.Really wanted this to work and t may work for you. I threw away all the paperwork, so I can't send it back.
__label__1 Useless with Thin Kerf Blades: I knew it was overpriced, but then that's to be expected with Delta (which now owns Biesmeyer) :( But the worst of it is that the spreader portion measures .120". Thus, thin kerf blades can not be used with this product. I called the manufacturer to see if a thin kerf spreader was available: it is not. With a major investment in thin kerf blades and no desire to go back to .125" kerf blades, I either machine down the spreader (more$$) or return it and do without. Hmmm......
__label__2 Loved it!: I thought this book was great. A few of the stories were not horror at all, but I thought the variety just increased my overall enjoyment. I borrowed this from the library, on a 14-day rental, and had it back to them on the fourth day. I just couldn't put it down. Best short stories I've read in some time (and I love short stories).
__label__1 A waste of money: It doesn't have search option. You can spend a lot of time to find sth in it.It is difficult to use keyboard. Try another product.
__label__2 not g-rated: I started reading the "Sword of Truth" series after watching "The Legend of the Seeker" on TV. The series was PG, maybe PG13 for some episodes. The books are R. Great story, great characters, easy to pick up and not put down, but very graphic brutality, gore, and rape. A few cursewords also. I just wanted to make this clear for any parents ;)
__label__2 Pharcyde Minus One: That should be the real title of this album. Though the three remaining members hold their own lyrically, and the in house prodution is decent, one can only wonder just how tight a full L.P. WITH fatlip would be. The first song "pain" tells the story of sucess and failure, which pharcyde knows well with label problems and in group quarrels. But the song is truly a stamp of perseverance in their struggle. We can only hope this quartet can join back together and show the hip-hop game what hip-hop is. Until then, we're stuck with an incomplete e.p. and a fatlip album with little promise.
__label__2 Surprice: Goku is in trouble and guess who come to the rescue? If you say Vegita you guess it right. Who would have thought of that? And yes, he has achive his goal, he became a Super Saiyan. As the battle continue Goku is in a life an death battle against the heart dissise, will he survives, nobody nows...yet? Trunks is back not the baby the big one. And Vegita realise that it is his son but from the future. What will he do? And why are these androids diferent from those of the futere? Found this and much more if you by these tape?
__label__2 DO NOT READ in your public library's Quiet Reading Room!: I wouldn't call this laugh-out-loud funny, but it is definitely chuckle-worthy. (Of course, I was in the Quiet Reading Room of the library when I read this, and loud cackling is not appreciated there.) This would be the perfect gift for someone who was obsessed with those silly old Looney Tunes cartoons.
__label__2 Close to five stars: Good protection, it looks like a "Batman camera" but it really works!!HOWEVER...!!! the plastic hard cover for the screen make difficult to access some functions, so that's why I prefer use it without screen protection.
__label__2 Read Moore AND Annenberg: Mark in Memphis, you might want to check the Annenberg site again: "October 16, 2004. Service Members, Families Say Pentagon Sent Too Few Troops To Iraq, Stressed National Guard and Reserves, Should Allow Photos of Coffins at Dover." There's always another part of the story--this book is simply one part, meant to be taken along with other sources for a full picture.
__label__2 To you who loved Metal in school and thought you'd outgrown: Holy Cow!I'm an avid music collector, over 1000 discs now, and the first time I listened to this I said "oh yes, this is what I have been waiting for..." I graduated high school in the 80s and loved all the heavy metal that was popular back then. Of course as I've grown into my 30s my musical horizons have been expanded beyond belief, into jazz, ambient, alternative, space music, you name it. The other day I got my hands on this and it's just the ticket. All the technical mastery you could want, but in a band that delights in playing AS A BAND and not just shredding into oblivion like Yngwie. Crossed up with some funk and enough other influences to really keep you captivated. It's great stuff!
__label__2 A must Read!: What a delight to read a book on the teaching of writing that is simple, focused, purposeful and concise. Katie Wood Ray writes with determination. It is her goal to birth the writer in each of us. As the reader engages in the reading of her work she midwifes the writing process within the reader in a way that one embraces it and nurtures its growth.The teacher/student in each of us has a life that is rich in experiences and thus embedded with curriculum possibilities. Katie open the readers mind to the world of writing and its possibilities. She writes "We need to know by heart what it is we are trying to teach when we teach...".There are no virgin pages in my copy of her book. It is my goal that the truth found in the reading of her work will become my truth in my teaching of the writing process. A wonderful and necessary read for all teachers. Let's write!
__label__1 Pathetic: Pathetic dialogue. Pathetic costumes. Fake beards. Fake accents. Thing runs about 5 hours long. Pathetic pro-slavery sentiment. Pathetic.
__label__1 No-go at this station.: I can't help but feel the need to write a less-than-memorable review on these books of Frank Herbert. I'm on the verge of giving it away, but if you read them, over %90 of them are people sitting on rock ledges or balconies thinking of plans and plans and plans. The action scenes seemed to be written as if they were afterthoughts, almost a "by the way" feeling. The characters were elaborate, but making them ACT was impossible, and that's why I gave the whole Dune series 2-stars instead of one. If you're thinking about reading them, ask someone who has already read them and then get a summary; it'll be quicker.
__label__1 Many many typos: These books were clearly not proofread before publication. Typos in a book for a command line operating system are a definite no-no.
__label__1 What's the Fuss?: Yes, the storytelling and character development are pedestrian at best, but it seems that those who decry the 'facts' in the book the loudest are those who fear that they may actually be true.
__label__2 great coverage of JUnit - get this one: This book really got me moving in the right direction with JUnit. I feel very comfortable writing all kinds of unit tests now and am incorporating my new knowledge into my projects at work. Get this book if you are looking to learn JUnit fast. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't the best book for reference material.
__label__2 Good Stuff: I was introduced to this product a few years back through the spa where I get massages. I find that it is easy to apply, doesn't have a "medicine" odor, and it really works to help alleviate pain while you are healing from back strain or other muscle strains. Though I have not personally used it as such, I have been told that after any exercise that is particularly strenuous like running for example, Biofreeze can be used to prevent aches and pains that might or usually occur as a result of that activity.I highly recommend this product without hesitation.
__label__2 Best price: Amazon had the best price on this. Delivery was quick and the memory insatlled easily, and my computer is certainly faster now.Very satisfied.
__label__1 Not Compatible with 2006 Acura TSX: When you search by vehicle, these refills come up. Please note that the 16" refill will fit perfectly on the OEM wiper, but the profile on this 26" refill is wrong. Before ordering, take the old refill out of your existing OEM wiper and compare with picture provided. You will see what I am talking about.
__label__2 The Blue Max: The Blue Max is a classical " FILM " starring a young GeorgePeppard (1966) it has an exccelent plot, beautiful scenerywith an unexpected ending.It is not a blood and guts movie.But rather an exceptional story about the morals of war.Anyone should enjoy this "FILM". A must see !!!
__label__1 Waste of Money: I am a student of chinese history and was totally disappointed in this book it came across as the ramblings of an old man. If I could give 1/4 of a star I would.
__label__2 Mellow and cool.: This is an upbeat, cool and mellow CD. Nothing negative. He has a good voice and it's great listening. I bought this CD for "Good Work if You Can Get It" and all the songs are good (of course duh...the Gershwins).
__label__2 The perfect combo blade for my tablesaw: The title says it all. This is the PERFECT combo blade. I can leave it on my tablesaw and it works great for ripping and crosscuts. No chipout on crosscuts and no burning and a reasonable feed rate on rips. This blade can do it all more than well enough for my needs. Also, the fact I can send it back to Forrest for precision resharpening is a big deal in my book.
__label__1 BAD DISCS: I was very disappointed to find that nearly every dvd in season 1 & 2 skipped and wouldn't play right even after cleaning . I must have gotten a bad batch and the worst part is that I wasn't able to view them until after the return period lapsed due to a heavy work schedule. Because it was a series and the discs were new and sealed, I never dreamed that they would all skip. My player is fine and plays other discs with no problem so I'm inclined to think I may just have gotten a bad batch of dvd's! I hope that Amazon will replace them, otherwise that's $30 down the drain which will force me to never buy from Amazon again!
__label__1 A perfect Bookend: The one line summary says it all. A perefct ornament. Reading it is a different story. Very poorly written or an incredibly poor translation. Can you imagine writing like this? Hooray to the run on sentences! Grade F
__label__2 Fantastic Action: Jason Bourne is THE new action hero.From beginning to end this movie kept me engaged and interested. I watched this on a long, crowded train trip and it kept me fully engrossed and perfectly distracted. I found myself wishing it would go on longer, and hoping for a couple more films in the series if they have this same pace and action.I enjoyed it completely.
__label__2 Great for curly hair: I have used this item in the past, but needed it replaced. The original one lasted me 4 years. You can purchase other name brands but nothing works as good as this Hot Sock. Love it!
__label__2 If you are a Kinison fan, buy this!: Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video. You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies. The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special. Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today. He will really be thought of as a comedy legend. These DVD's will crack you up. I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately? The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison. He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase. Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked.
__label__2 It works if you want!!: I am very happy to say that at the GMAT exam, which I studied with this book, I received 710 points. Especially the Verbal Part of this book is very useful, and each headline is stated clearly with many examples. Although its software is not very good, I can strongly recommend the book itself, if you decide to work hard. You'll see it'll work.
__label__1 Not again...: Let's face it, the first movie was the best and will never be equalled. The t.v. series was also very good, and I liked it a lot. But this movie was a waste of $6. I don't think the editing could have been any worse, totally choppy, and cut in to the continuity. As far as the acting goes, Adrian Paul looked lost, and Christopher Lambert looked to be in a great deal of pain. (And what ever happened to Paul's character "laying down the sword" at the end of the t.v. series?) I would love to see a t.v. movie with Adrian Paul as Highlander, but please no more theatrical releases.
__label__1 LEAKING!!!: These bottles are awful! From day one, they have done nothing but leak and create a mess all over my daughter, the couch, the floor, you name, AVENT bottles have leaked on it! They were recommended by a friend, who's a nurse. My daughter still gets air in her belly from the bottles. Plus you have to buy new and expensive nipples as the child gets older...so the new nipples can leak on you. I've told several friends NOT to buy these bottles!
__label__1 Broke after the first use: My mother in law has used one of these for years, the same one in fact for about 15 years. I am sure hers wore out 13-14 years ago. I purchased 2 for her as we joke about this quite a bit and the first one broke after the first use. The second is holding up well.
__label__2 homemade popsicle/fudgesicle are the best: I love this product. I make my own sugar free fudgesicles and they are great. Even my finicky neighbor thought they were terrific. This product makes something that adults can really appreciate, and I am sure children would too. I have no kids but grandnephew though fudgesicles tasted just like store bought or better. Simple easy to make. Fudgesicles, pudding mix, 3 c. mile, and three dollaps of either plain yogurt or sour cream, mix in blender and poor into mold. Should fill up all ten. Freeze for 4 hours and ta da...fudgesicles. Enjoy
__label__2 love it: i got into BoC about three years ago, and my listening habits have never quite been the same. BoC has this insane way of making one addicted to their sound...to their vibe. Twoism is the latest addition to my BoC catalogue...i now have all albums by this wonderful duo out of Scotland. Twoism is very complex, yet very simple. it does sound like an early release, but don't let that fool you. Twoism carries quite a dark underlying tone...the second track, Oirectine, is my favorite. the whole album is phenomenal....if you like BoC at all, you owe it to yourself to get this collection of music. put on some headphones, play track two, close your eyes, and drift...peace,cic
__label__2 Wit with existential angst: Anagrams is a book to keep you on your toes, laughing and crying at the same time. Benna is a character I will never forget, too clever to see the truth in front of her nose. Long may she live with her daughter Georgina. If you are lucky, she will imagine you.
__label__1 Self-indulgent: Low on information density. Digressions into author's school life and lectures in Eastern Europe add nothing to the understanding of the topic.Truly good material available in the story of development of The Calculus, especially in the conflict over precedence between Newton and Leibnitz. But its lost in this book
__label__2 Real Men: If you love stories of the old West, this book is a must read!George Laycock does a nice job of giving us a good overview of this time period in our Western History. The book tells much about those days of trapping and exploring when the West was an unknown and unmapped area. In addition to telling the stories of several individual characters like John Colter, Jim Bridger, Hugh Glass, Jeidiah Smith and others, the author takes time to explain the fur trapping business. There are several sections in the book explaining weapons, traps, boats, clothing, tools, etc. The result is that the reader gets a good insight into what these men did and how they did it. The one drawback might be that some of the character studies are a bit short, often leaving the reader wanting more information. However, for a general overview of an important time in our early history, this is a wonderful book. I'd like to see this as required reading in our schools.
__label__2 Easy assembly!: I agree with the other reviews regarding ability of this grill to cook. It does great. I would like to point out that this thing was incredibly easy to assemble. So if you are hesitant to buy this thing because you want to the guy at home depot to build your grill for you ... don't be. It took less than an hour with a screw driver and a socket set (you can use the wrench that it came with, but a socket wrench really saves time).Frankly, this thing was easier to assemble than that piece of crap char-broil that it is replacing.
__label__2 Great Book for Teens: I bought this as a gift for my 12 year-old niece. I read it before I gave it to her to make sure it was appropriate. I LOVED THIS BOOK. Bobbi addresses the girls as peers, tells them to love their looks, particularly those things which make them "unique"- freckles, a strong nose, etc., and urges them to use make-up primarily as an enhancement. She also discusses skin care, hair care, and shows before and after pictures. I want to get the one for adults, and I already plan on buying one for my own daughter when she is older.
__label__1 I responded!: When I read this book, it taught me many things that I could say to the Mormons. Several days later a missionary came to my door and he taught me the discussions. I used the responses that this book told me to and I realized that every response the missionary had was a better one. Because of this and because I felt the Holy Spirit, I knew that what the Mormon said is true. Now I am a member of the Church and I am so much happier now. I get along with my family and friends and I love Jesus Christ more than I ever did before.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: I really just wanted the function of being able to play a cassette, but, it chewed the tape I use to test it and I knew I couldn't try it again, but it does pick up some radio channels.
__label__1 Died within a few months: The first time we let the battery drain completely, it died. It will not recharge. It is totally dead.
__label__1 Cheap price, cheap hardware: My first Averatec had a defect in the power system, such that the battery could not charge. I spent $20 shipping it back for a replacement, and a month later got a replacement.The replacement has a dead pixel, the case smudges easily, the card reader is defective and after 1 year of use, the casing around the screen is cracked, the sound does not work at less than half volume, and the hard drive is dead. Note that the hard drive died just after the warranty expired, as is typical with companies using very cheap hardware.The laptop also runs very hot, the fans are loud, battery life is about 1.5 hours, and the wireless is sketchy. My next laptop will not be an Averatec.If you do buy an Averatec, expect to use it for about a year, with hardware problems now and then. After your warranty expires, the laptop will fall apart.
__label__2 Works great after 72,000 miles!: I currently use this filter on a Honda Element. In the element, the filter position (used on a K&N intake) causes one side of the filter to gunk up first, so it must be rotated occasionally. I wash the filter every 5-8k miles with K&N Filter cleaner and re-oil with K&N filter oil. It never comes quite as clean as you would like and it is starting to show some wear to the material and mesh cover. I think I'll toss it at 100k miles and get a new one, but that seems like a fair service life for a $40 filter. It might last longer in light or city use and or less time in a dirty/country road environment.
__label__1 Horrible item, horrible seller: I bought this early for winter, didn't need to use until two weeks after purchase. It worked great the first four nites then stopped. Now it won't turn on. I called the seller on day 30 after the ORDER date (not ship date, not received date) asking for an exchange or refund. The rep clucked on the phone about it being thirty days, took my info and promised a call back. A week later, no call back. I can't get through on DeLonghi's number, I'm put straight into a hold queue and after half an hour I hang up. This item is definitely not worth the money, and Polstein's is an equally unreliable seller with zero customer service.
__label__1 Take a pass on the HP 4470C: Although I was able to get some nice quality scans from the HP 4470C, in general the scanner was very slow and unreliable. The warm-up time for the lamp was very long and scans in transparancy mode (slides & negatives) consistantly had excessive scan lines at higher resolutions. My biggest complaint about this scanner is the fact that it stopped working about 10 days after the 3 month warranty expired. At that point HP will 'repair' the unit for the same price as a brand new scanner.In short, I would recommend taking a pass on the HP 4470C and use your money to buy a similar Epson or Canon scanner (which both come with 1 year warranties).
__label__2 Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism: Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism is an excellent book into the intro of sadomasochism. I learned alot abut myself by reading this book.
__label__2 great frier: Could not wait to try it out ..it works wonderful I am so pleased with it and wish every one would buy one.Great price,great fast shipment.
__label__2 My Favorite Pot!: This little pot puts my other household makers to shame. Use it in my bedroom and it is so convenient. The removable water tank and carafe filter have helped me immensely. Bought it while on crutches and it saved time and steps. Uses the Cuisinart 4cp filter perfectly. Coffee temp is great, fill line marks are accurate for coffee measurements, filter does help tap taste if used (I normally use spring water). Miss auto shut off, but can live without.
__label__2 Fabulous memorial to a departed Route 66 icon: Before its unfortunate demolition in 1995, the Coral Court Motel enjoyed dual renown. The Streamline Moderne marvel was both the most beautiful motel along Route 66 and the most notorious "hot sheet" motel in metropolitan St. Louis.Shellee Graham's tribute to the Coral Court honors both sides of the legacy. (The text is rated PG, though I suspect the author would have little difficulty producing an R- or X-rated version.) Ms. Graham, a noted Route 66 photographer, combines her own images with period shots and numerous interviews to trace the birth, life and death of the Coral Court. Highly recommended to fans of Route 66 or roadside architecture -- as well as anyone who ever took advantage of the covered garages attached to each unit for an hour or two of private, er, "rest."
__label__2 Window Into His Heart: Having seen Clay Aiken twice in concert, I knew I would want this album as soon as it was released. I expected something wonderful, but what surprised me is how personal the selections seem--it's as if Clay has opened a window into his heart for us. This album is both refreshing & poignant, & just like the previous ones, I'll be buying extras for gifts. Thank you, Clay, for sharing--
__label__2 Heart of the Kingdom: This is one of the better RPGs I have played in my time. While it may look cartoony with the Disney characters, or over the top with mixing them up with Final Fantasy characters, it blends together really well to provide an excellently challenging game.
__label__1 Not what I expected based on his earlier material: Having recently heard some amazing live material from the late 70's while Duke was playing with Billy Cobham, I was really excited to check out this DVD. Seeing that such monster players like Louis Johnson were on it made me all the more excited, but I must admit that this performance was not what I expected. I was hoping for more of the 70's style material: heavier jazz, fusion and straight-up funk, but this performance was mainly an excercise in 80's pop and disco. Don't get me wrong, the musicianship is killer. Duke performs an amazing, unaccompanied key-tar solo and Louis Johnson's bass higlights are no-joke, but overall the performance was just too 80's mainstream and lacking the serious funk that I was expecting. It was just too 80's cheese....
__label__2 masterful but where is Freud?: Reviews below pointed out two prominent philosophers the authors have neglected. But I think the biggest omission is the late Freud, whose concept of a "bodily ego" is remarkably similar to the views presented here. Moreover Freud's work in dream interpretation, though rather naive, also anticipates Lakoff and Johnson. Before these authors, the father of psychoanalysis was the only thinker to take seriously the metaphorical nature of thought. But of course there's much that is original in this book, particularly the extensive critique of western philosophy. Chomsky and Quine have indeed retired . . .
__label__1 If you already bought 3.0 dont bother...: First, I will ignore the economics of the new version.I would also add that before buying you can find a list of changes on the WotC website, if you own 3.0 already check it out.With this in mind I would conider this a unneeded revison. By far the most changes were to spells. For example, Polymorph other and polymorph self become Polymorph and Baneful Polymorph, not much difference other than duration. Also, Harm has been reduced to 10hp per level damage. Does any one out there with a PC cleric actually prepare Harm? (as reviewed in Dragon Magazine)The one cool thing I found in the revision notes was that a Paladins warhorse is now a summoned creature. Very useful for those that travel by sea or Teleport often.
__label__1 A Few Detailed Facts Are Wrong!: The book is a good reference but not as accurate as the Internet or Google today. For example, the book has the wrong information on what College actually put numbers on Football Jerseys. According to the History of American Football and Sports Illustrated in 1908, Karl Davis, at the time publicity man for the University of Pittsburgh, first put numbers on college football jerseys.Davis used that good old sales pitch, "One cannot tell the players without a program!" He quickly added to this service the refinement of switching the numbers each week due to Davis having the program concession. Davis thus became a double pioneer in player numbering and in "dynamic obsolescence". Both inventions have come a long way since.When I see such errors, I wonder how many other facts the author got it wrong or just did sloppy research. Anyway, the Internet Age has made such books obsolete and mistakes unimportant since they can be corrected easily today with easy research.
__label__2 Wonderful Innovation: PROS:Having used several other planers, the DeWalt 735 is a real winner. I have 3 of these units. I placed the planers on a Rubbermaid carts & slid 30 gal trash cans below (bottom shelf). What a blessing - to plane & not have dust / chips flying everywhere. Thess planers are super & super easy to use (& change blades).CONS:The draw string doesn't grip sufficiently. But, adding a ratcheting strap clamp solves that problem.
__label__1 How to Paint with Wax? Hardly.: Well, it's my own fault. I read the other reviews here and still bought the book. I was disappointed with the content (which wasn't very helpful for a novice) the artwork in the book, as well as the SIZE of the book. If you want to learn how to do Encaustic painting - you won't learn it here. All the author tells you is that you melt some wax on an iron and spread it around. He doesn't even touch on the other forms of Encaustic painting, such as using a "crock pot" and a brush - just as one example.
__label__1 Not good enough for business: This product is OK, if you only have one computer connected to your Modem ROUTER. If you have 2 or 3 computers connected to your Router for wireless connection. Then, you will have problem viewing it, it may required repeated resetting.I'm planning to have this replace soon. This product, I think works fine if you use it at home. [...]
__label__1 Sucks: I bought this item with a pyle 500 watts speakers, and all of them are broken..If you really want to waste money is fine , buy it.Amazon should not be selling that garbage..Plz take a look to what you are selling to people..
__label__2 Simple but efficient - and definitely not outdated: This book deals with mental tennistactics. Brad lets you think about your own game, and analyzes where things often tend to go wrong (on all levels: pros, but also clubplayers). It is helpful in making you a smarter player. A must read, and a true classic already, for everyone who wants to get its own game improved.
__label__1 not what i thought: it wasn't at all what i thought it would be. when i tried to get more information on it, it wouldn't let me find out any of the artist. which the whole cd is the same artist just remixed 26 times///
__label__2 The greatest: How can it get any better? The first 6 books of Harry Potter in a box set. Now if I just have the patience to wait another month for #7.
__label__2 Fun, Exciting: This is definitely one of Lena Horne's best RCA albums. I hoped and prayed that this would be put on cd and on the original label, which isn't always done these days. It would appear that other countries appreciate Lena's Music more, as many of her original albums are are available on cd in other parts of the would. It is difficult to find any Lena Horne cd's in a regular music store. None the less, like with many hard to find things, Amazon had it. This album is worth the wait and every penny. A perfect album for a nice sunny summer day. Or a cloudy one because it brightens the spirit. Order it today. Maybe more of Lena's ablums will be put on cd.
__label__2 Good Shepherd.: I'm sure there are some who say all Enya albums sound the same, but I believe this is truly one of her best. I hesitate to say it's better than "Watermark", but I'll call it my second favorite. This is a wonderful mix of songs. Some like "Caribbean Blue" and "Book Of Days" border on smooth pop, while others like "Lothlorien" and "Afer Ventus" are lush and hypnotic. Her arrangments of vocals and piano/synth practically lull you into a dream-state. This is obviously in every massage parlor in the country. "Angeles" is another track I love, and like the rest of the album, it really sounds angelic. However, I think the song I enjoy most, is the simple yet moving "No Holly For Miss Quinn". New fans might just want her "Best Of", but they'll indeed be missing some excellent songs from "Shepherd Moon".
__label__2 Hooked on Rook: The Rook card game is an old Southern Card Game that my husband's family always played in Alabama. We like the two player version and the four player partner version. It is fast paced and lots of fun to bid and take your tricks. There is strategy involved in bidding and taking tricks to get your bid, but the most fun is when you set your opponent!
__label__2 Scooby Doo is da Bomb!: I have been watching Scooby since I was 2 I'm now 9. I think scooby is really cool and I can't wait for the new moive to come out!
__label__2 plant earth: Just a great movie and good quality on the blu-ray format. this ia my favorite bluray purchase to date. The oceans and forrest just burst off the screen.
__label__2 Cool Game!: Despite what others have said, I believe that this is one of the best Star Wars games ever created. First of all, who wouldn't want to have a jetpack and suit of armor covered in cool gadgets. I love the gameplay. It's pretty classic shoot-em-up, Star Wars style. The only downsides are the animation, while still excellent, is not on par with other games, such as Rouge Leader. Also, the levels are very long with no way to save in the midst of playing. Otherwise, I love this game.
__label__1 Did I miss something?: This obnoxious collection of plastic had my daughter in tears. Not only was she freaked out by the rattle of plastic moving all over the place and frequently spilling out of the "tracks", I was stunned at how thoughtless I was to purchase this toy for her. I should have purchased something less overwhelming and hyper-stimulating. She's almost a year old and she's not the type of kid who gets turned on by all the clamor, apparently. I would say that this is an outstanding mess of a toy, and a pointless noisemaker. Unfortunately, I give this a huge "thumbs-down".
__label__1 Don't upgrade if you don't have to.: Oh--my--gosh is this awful. I have used ACT for about 5 years and have never had a problem. Until yesterday. Make sure you have at least 1G of RAM or else it runs unusefully slow. I can't use it. Unless you MUST upgrade don't get it.
__label__1 Disappointing: I watched this in the theater with my son. The first 20 minutes of it are pleasant and wonderful.Then the shift comes in tone, scenes are edited quickly. Episodes from the second book are introduced to fill gaps. The story becomes one great big mess. Whole other episodes go unfilmed, unexplained.My son who had such glee for the first two reels walked out of the theater fairly angry.He ticked off several things wrong with the picture's framework, and large gaps in the story line, missing important elements.PS: he doesn't want to even think about owning a DVD of the feature.
__label__1 What a waste of my money: I knew i was taking a chance buying a cheap eye cream and sure enough i was right. IT DID NOTHING! Well yo get what you pay for! I was going to try the Ocuderm or DDF products and i guess i will do that now. Costs more but the results i hear are great. I should of known better....
__label__2 Wonderful Fantasy Book: This fantastic book is an amazing sequel to The Book of Three and The black cauldron. Finding these books in my school library, I read the first one over winter break. I couldn't wait for the break to be over so I could get the sequels. This book turned out to be my favortite out of all five, though The High King was a close rival. The enchanting story about how Princess Eilonwy goes to Mona with Taran and Gurgi is facinating. All of the characters are unique in there own way, no matter how odd the character is. I love the character Prince Rhun. He is really funny. The ending of this book surprised me. I thought that Eilonwy would come willingly, happy to be rescued, but the ending is far from that. It is truly a worthy sequel to the first two books.
__label__1 No es lo que esperaba: Antes de comprar este radio lei muchos review para estar seguro que era lo que iba a comprar, despue de tanto leer me decidi a comprarlo.Al instalarlo me lleve la sorpresa de que no era todo lo que yo esperaba.Anteriormente tenia un Pionner instalado ese radio muy raras veces brincaba o el disco saltaba cuando me iba en un hueco o transitaba por calle mala, con el Dual es imposible transitar calle mala el disco salta mucho.Otro defecto es el volumen del radio, si les gusta que su carro suene bien y duro no compren este radio que de eso tiene muy poco.Podria seguir diciendo cosas, pero al final quien a tenido un Pionner sabe lo que tuvo por lo cual estoy esperando que aparezca alguien para poder vender el Dual e ir a la tienda por el Pionner, bien vale el dicho "mejor viejo conocido que nuevo por concer".
__label__2 Simply the BEST: This is a great CD , It will change your standard ,the sound is outoutstanding , It is a MUST BUY for Classical listener.
__label__2 Kindle 2: I am now the proud owner of the Kindle 2. I am glad that I waited to buy one and have the second generation Kindle.I absolutely love it and it will pay for itself in less than a year. I am an avid reader, so the cost I will save downloading the books is terrific.I bought profession books too, at an awesome savings. I love the text to speech option too.I take my Kindle everywhere, so I always have something to read.I have shown my Kindle to everyone who will listen. Some of my colleagues are looking to buy one now.I would recommend it to anyone!Michele
__label__1 Four failed attempts in a row!: I bought this for my children last summer. I also bought two things of Diet Coke and extra Mentos. We tried two in a row, the first one shot out the sides and the second one tipped over. No cool geyser tower. We were very disappointed.So again I purchased two things of Diet Coke and two things of Mentos. First time it shot out the side and the second time I made sure it was as tight as tight can be and the Mentos got stuck in the tube! I tried to get them down but it was too late a couple had already gone down in and I couldn't get them to drop down fast enough to do anything other than you could accomplish by shaking up the bottle!All in all it was very disappointing. Especially since we've watched the YouTube videos. We just can't seem to catch a break and I'm all done trying.
__label__2 Does the Trick: This Bob console so perfectly performs as it claims to that there's not much more to say! it is as attractive as it is functional, cohesive with the quality, sporty Bob craftsmanship/design.
__label__1 Lead Decanter: The set looks nice. Just make sure you are aware that this decanter is made with lead crystal. I did not realize it when I bought it for someone as a gift. I had to return it (which meant taking it to a UPS store and paying for the return shipping which was not cheap) and they take a 15% restocking fee.
__label__1 No more scot accent, please!: Why is it that when a romance book is set in Scotland it becomes almost unreadable? When a book is set in France, the author does not write the dialogue in French or in English with a French accent. The author assumes that we, as intelligent readers, will know that the characters are speaking in the language of their country. Then why are we subjected to "dinna" and "ken" all through books set in Scotland? Please! We know that Scottish characters will speak with a Scottish burr. We do not need to be hit over the head!If you do not mind wading through the dialogue, the story is fun and enjoyable.
__label__2 better than what you've heard: I thoroughly enjoyed this story and found it quite humorous. No, it's not as "in depth" as most of Pratchett's books and it is quite short. However, I found this to be very refreshing. It was a nice change of pace from the other Discworld stories. It is a great "light" read and a good story.
__label__2 A Must Read: I had to read this little book in my AP Literature class back in high school. I checked it out of the library a few days before my final essay was due, read it very quickly, and was even excited to write my paper on it. I ended up ordering it later, I couldn't stand to see my bookshelf without it. It's very personal, somewhat depressing, but absolutely beautiful. My copy is all marked up with notes and highlighted quotes, I'm always going back and rereading!
__label__1 Oh NO!!!: There are many much nicer cd's of this type of music available, luckily there have been made many recordings of mexican piano music from the XIX century ,this one would be good except for the pianist Guadalupe Parrondo, I don't like her.Stay away from it!!!!
__label__1 Bored my child too quickly: It took longer to get the darn thing out of the packaging than my daughter actually played with it. She is 7 and LOVES horses, but she became bored with this toy within 15 minutes. Played with once and hasn't played with it again since christmas.
__label__1 Bare Naked Pop: As a peripheral BNL fan, I have always admired the off beat sense of humor these guys dish out. With previous releases, I have been able to discover new things in repeated listenings. This cd got stale fast. Seems to be geared to the tween crowd. I am hopeful newer releases will stay true to the BNL I have enjoyed in years past.
__label__1 Appalling sound quality: Not much better than an old cheap transistor radio in sound quality. I bought it to listen to CDs at bedtime, but I can't bear to hear music on it. A very regrettable purchase. I'm replacing it asap.
__label__2 From 0 to 60: If you're a newcomer to the industry, this book will quickly and clearly bring you up to speed on the technologies, companies, and issues behind the biotech industry. And even if you're a grizzled veteran, there are stories-behind-the-stories, background, and perspective you're unlikely to get from any other source.
__label__2 BOOGY BOARD CHOICE: GREAT BOARD. WELL WORTH THE PRICE. COULD BE A LOT BETTER DESCRIBED THOUGH - IHAD NO IDEA OT WAS RATED FOOR 80 LBS. - BUT EVEN AT THAT RATING ITS 10X BETTER THAN WHAT YOU BUY AT THE BEACH STORES OR WAL MART.
__label__1 Not very fond of it.: This roll on perfume is not my type. I will no longer buy products just on good reviews. I can barely smell it. Not worth it, sorry and I'm usually not picky but this is awful.
__label__2 Funny!: I really enjoyed Bridget Jones's Diary. I decided to read the book after the movie and was thrilled that I did. It made me laugh out loud and it was hard to put down!
__label__2 Swift, entertaining reading: This is a well-written book that moves along quickly and has an interesting, bright heroine. My only complaint is that it is billed as a gothic romance and isn't as spooky or suspenseful as the gothics I am used to. However, there is PLENTY of heart-stopping romance here though (which is often an afterthought in some gothics) so it sort of balances itself out. Jo-Ann Power is an author I will be very happy to read again!
__label__1 F-: This is my review of Endymion Spring by Matthew Skelton.I give the book an F-. I didn't like it at all, and it was very boring most of the time. The author does a poor job of making the story interesting. The characters all act alike and speak alike. You can't even tell them apart most of the time. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone else.Emma, 7th grade
__label__2 Either you like it or hate it!: After reading The E-Business (R)Evolution, I was puzzled about the very diverging comments on the book, and it seems that either you like his casual style of writing or you hate it. I, for my part, enjoyed the book very much, even though some typos are still in there (but this is something the publisher can resolve with a reprint), the value it provides to my business is huge.
__label__2 NY Yankee dog jersey: It arrived at my door in perfect conditionand fit my dog perfectly. It washed well and looked adorable on him/ I got many positive compliments.
__label__2 Comical at times, serious at times: I've read a lot of chick lit books and really liked this one. The author had me laughing out loud at times! I was intrigued throughout the entire book- from the dates she went on, her job, and her sister's illness. Looking forward to reading some of the author's other books.
__label__1 Terrible Speaker, Average Microphone: The sound quality of the speaker on this unit is very bad. As for people hearing you clearly on the other end, its performance is average at best. If you are a Mac user looking for a solution for Skype (like me), your built-in speakers and microphone are as good or better than this device.
__label__1 DRM is a show stopper.: hmmm... One of the most highly anticipated games of 2008 is being released it's time to see when it's going to pop up on Steam...Wait, it's not on Steam?OMG EA? Really EA?Please don't buy this game until the DRM is removed, or else your just validating the existence of useless, archaic DRM.
__label__1 Warning: May not be a good introduction!: This book is meant as an introduction to Ayn Rand's philosophy. Yet is it really good as an introduction? See the Letter to the Editor at the Intellectual Activist website in which David Harriman, Gary Hull, Andrew Lewis, and Leonard Peikoff state that this book is definately not.If you are looking for an introduction to Objectivism you are better served by Ayn Rand's own intro in The Voice of Reason.
__label__1 WoW..: first listen is a okay cd..second listen is a lousy cd..third listen is a worst cd in centuries.....dun buy this album..trust me..dun support Bo..coz he's just a rocker..nothing for you to like him for..
__label__1 Very disappointing: My son was very disappointed when he received this item. It looks nothing like the picture. The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture. I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this. I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available.
__label__2 Absolutely Gorgeous!: These shoes, in grey, are really stunning. The grey suede, tan leather tie, and the wickerish heel and platform work beautifully together.I have to admit that I haven't even worn them yet, so I can't vouch for comfort, although they feel pretty good when I try them on every now and then. I just haven't had the proper occasion to actually wear them.I guess I have the Rachel Zoe attitude (though not her money, figure, or social life) about fashion--it can be artwork. I should probably get them out of the box and put them on display to get my money's worth!
__label__1 Another (yawn) Disney "Masterpiece": It amazes me how shameless the Disney people are, slapping that label "masterpiece" on every recent animated feature they've done. And so too with "Mulan."This could have been a real provocative piece of storytelling. But once again, Disney plays it safe, following the formula of past successes. We get great animation, but a superficial story. Nothing really insightful about Chinese culture, history, or for that matter, gender, is revealed. The cute "sidekick" characters (this time a hip, wisecracking dragon) in these Disney features are getting very stale. The obligatory songs, which often trivialize what little meaning is found in the script, also get very predictable.I keep hoping that one of these days, Disney will really give their talented animators a chance to do a feature like no other -- a new work which will be looked back upon as redefining the storytelling power of this medium. That would be a "masterpiece," and "Mulan" is far, far from it!
__label__1 Not an Upgrade: Microsoft pulled a fast one on us. Instead of increaing functionality with the Money 2006 Standard, they actually removed the tax estimating and planning functionality. If this is critical, do not "upgrade" or go with the Deluxe version.
__label__2 Nidhiki review: My son loves this bionicle. It combned with two other bionicles to make a giant Makuta. I would recommend it.
__label__2 Works great, looks great!: I am so pleased that the Contoured Changing Table Pad has so many choices in color for its cover! I purchased the lilac, and a white cover and they both go well with my nursery decor. I only wish I got more that two!These terrycloth covers are thick, absorbant and easy on my newborn's skin. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a little when you wash them. So, when you go to put them back on the pad the fit is a bit tight, but I find they pull out pretty quickly to thier normal size. When they do finally get to small to fit the pad I will go out and buy some more! I mean it's terrycloth, what do ya expect? Besides, the darn things get all kinds of yuck on them all day. They are going to take a beating being washed all the time as it is. They are totally worth the money to replace! I would buy them again!
__label__2 A lovely tea: Delicate aroma and flavor and a lovely tin. Harney and Sons make excellent teas. You won't be disappointed with this tea.
__label__2 enjoy the romance: Always enjoy books by Nora Roberts. Have never read one that I did not like. The intrigue combined with the romance is always a pleasure.
__label__2 "Well, I Liked It!": The storyline of this novel reminds me of "The Best Of Everything", a movie I saw on T.V. and now have on D.V.D. I read this book then I stopped, after a few months passed I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did. To the other reviewers: What's so bad about this book?
__label__1 Clearly the author is filled with hate and bitterness.: The author is very bitter over the fundamentalist stance on homosexuality. He is the one filled with hate not the christians he obviously despises. He wants to take the parts of the bible he agrees with, and discredits the parts that condemn his life style. A bunch of manure is what I call this book. Don't waste time or money reading it.
__label__2 Great Deal: Use it all the time and works great. Best deal I've seen around for awhile. Will get another one also. Loads of fun with Amazon.com Thank youJohnny Sciolaro
__label__2 I love this book: I read this book many years ago and it stuck in my head. I am so glad that I was able to find it again, love this book, love the characters, although it does get a little soppy at the end. I think that the build up of the story is good.
__label__1 Sorry Nikki: Nikki My Girl!!!To me this one seem to be slow and to long time to get to the point I found my self skipping pages to get the action. Sorry Nikki Your a great writer I just didnt FEEL this one!!!
__label__1 Not for lone User: I found this cuff *very* hard to put on and get adjusted by myself. It required another person to make this work. The readings I got, even when another helped me use it, were not any more accurate than my wrist blood pressure monitor (which can be used by one person easily.)
__label__1 disappointed: actually, the album gets five stars. the dvd only one star since i am able to access the bonus material on either of the two stand alone dvd players that i have. it plays just fine on my mac, but at the end of the day it's not the same. i'm tempted to buy another copy and trade my other one in. we'll see.
__label__1 Don't bother with the 3D version: My score is based on the 3D only.The 3D is next to non-existent. This was converted to 3D in post and it is the worst viewing experience I've had in 3D so far. Save your money if you are looking for new 3D content.
__label__2 As Expected: They look beautiful! A little slick, but that can be taken care of with some a little scuffing.
__label__2 The best album to get to know this band by.: This was the first cd by this band I had purchased. There are no bad songs to be found here. "Dancing Nancies" is a great pick me up song. Each song has wonerful groove power. You can not help but sing and dance along. If you would like to get to know this band this is the cd to own.
__label__1 As mediocre as its characters: Macy is definitely talented at writing narrative, and I look forward to future efforts from her, but this novel left me with all of the emotional and intellectual reaction that I would have from reading a pamphlet in a dentist's office describing a toothbrush. I'd liken The Fundamentals of Play to a written exercise most us probably had in high school - writing a piece in the style of another author, and people rightly compare this work to Fitzgerald and some others. I don't much have a problem with that conceptually, although a unique style is more interesting if it's good, but Macy's characters and themes are uniformly vague and not engaging to the reader. This novel had potential to be better than it is, but the story and its characters needed more dimension.
__label__2 black tape: What's not to like? Same quality stuff I got from the camera store, at a better rate. Better than duct tape too.
__label__1 Ok. For a daily log but....not an interesting read.: I have read tons of sailing books and I found this author spent far too much time complaining about having to bail his constantly leaking boat when he passes dozens, if not hundreds, of ports along the way that he could have stopped at to get it fixed. If you chose not to fix something then stop complaining about it page after page. Since he seemed bent on not stopping, the book lacked interesting stories of people and places he visited along the way and we were stuck listening to a guy give a daily log of the weather, his thoughts and complaints of how hard his trip was and how poorly built his boat was. It was just interesting enough for me to finish reading it, but I was glad when it was finally over. Others seemed to give it good reviews but it just wasn't my type of book.
__label__1 Too much talk - not enough facts: I normally try to be positive and find the best in things. But this book is a waste of time, considering the many good investment books out there. It has a few valuable points, but they could be stated on one page. To the authors defence, I am in favor of books that cut to the bone and I really hate having to read hundreds of pages of nothing, to get his point.If you are a first time reader of this kind of topic, the book is okay. As long as you understand that it will wont give you any tools - just rough guidelines.I, unfortunately, also listen to the audiotape. Its even worse.
__label__1 Mediocre coverage of an incredible event: The uprising at Gallaudet University and the "Deaf President Now" campaign were the culmination of a long and fascinating history of the Deaf people and culture. Interesting as the events were, however, this book is not the place to be introduced to them. The writing is mediocre at best, and oftentimes reads like a junior high school essay. And as was mentioned by another reviewer, the bias just bleeds off the page. Key players are either hero-worshipped or vilified, with little ground in-between.In short, the book rattles off a sequence of events like a child's report on some foreign country, but captures no essence of the excitement and tenseness that must have been present.For a much better account, I'd recommend the third chapter of "Seeing Voices" by Oliver Sacks. Sacks was also an eyewitness to the protests, albeit in a somewhat detached, observational role, but his writing better captures the emotion and power of this extraordinary historical event.
__label__1 regretful: If you loved the series please,please do not read the last book it will leave you totally disappointed to say the least!
__label__1 MOBILE 8: My plan was to get a pocket size record of my customer's files to load on my Palm TX. However the FileMaker Mobile 8 only allows 50 fields to be used which rendered it useless for my purpose. Since I never loaded it, I don't know how it otherwise would have performed.
__label__2 great for the price: I had no idea how small this item was until I finally saw it in person. It's great though because I tested it in a large office where 2 people were talking and I could even hear one of them typing on the keyboard. The only reason why I gave it a 4 out of 5 is because I haven't tested this in a conference meeting setting so I don't know how well it would pick up more people in a larger room.
__label__1 Awful Packaging: (The Walking Dead Omnibus Volume 1 & 2 HC) The books are awesome, the poor rating is for the packaging only.Just received replacement books for the first ones that were damaged (Omnibus Vol 1 & 2), Volume 1 is damaged AGAIN. The binding on the first 2 were cracked on the corner, one of the replacements is also cracked. When I pay $60+ for collector books they better be in new condition.The books were just laying in a box with large loose bubble wrap, they were free to move around and damage the corners. I normally have good experiences with Amazon, but they have no freaking clue how to package books. Very frustrating.
__label__2 Good design, good value, very portable: First of all the description of the repair stand is incomplete in regard to the "accessories"... there is either a small storage area for nuts and bolts OR a digital weight scale.I purchased the stand due to the overall design of the stand: tripod design, collapsible, travel/storage bag, clamp design. I worked at a bicycle shop for about 5 years and tried several different brands but I liked the topeak stand the most for the price (I tried a similarly designed stand but it was about $75 higher in price). This is also the often the stand of choice when our shop provided mechanical assistance at races/events.
__label__1 Mini tripod flashlight poorly constructed: One legs fell off the mii tripod within the first hout I had it. This rendered the tripod function useless I should have returned it but that would cost too much. I would not buy product again
__label__2 Floetry = Lyrical Poetry: "Floetic" is by far one of the best pieces that I have ever acquired. The CD has just the perfect balance of smooth R&B tracks and banging beats, while at the same time satisfying one's need for a lyrical soothing, something that is lacking in much of today's music. "Floetic" is simply a feel good CD, it's positive, and speaks about real things that real people can relate to. There is no doubt that Floetry has outdone themselves and put their mark on American music that it sure to turn heads. Don't think twice about it, just buy it.
__label__1 Does NOT fit a 2002 BMW 540i with M62 engine!: This belt does not fit even though Amazon said it did when I ordered it.This belt has an effective length of 62.2 inches. The above automobile requires a 64-65 inch effective length.I discovered this after 30 days after ordering, so I am out of luck for a return.Very disappointed with Amazon on this one. If you order well in advance for a future project, you'd better check it within 30 days for proper fit.
__label__1 Only Two Players: I bought this game because we play it all the time at our friends, it's the ultmate party game. You can have two couples playing, and change the difficulty level for each player. So everyone has a fair chance. We play it for hours on end. I bought this since it had Tetris inlcuded. However, from looking at the box, this version has support for only 2 players, instead of four. I was very dissapointed in that the 4 player tourney is what makes it so fun.
__label__1 Tremendous film 5 stars--1 star for this version...: Once again americans are forced to suffer the lack of extra features and the UK gets a 'real' version of this delightful film. Frankly I'm tired of the film industries doing this with dvds. If there are special features for a dvd, those features should be on every copy no matter what country you live in! I don't think it's too much to ask for and do we really need dvd regions? I think not!Thanks for nothing Fox Century!
__label__1 Do not buy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: This is by far the worst piece of junk I have ever bought from Amazon.very thin and uncomfortable. cheap fabric and was an almost impossible task to put together. the company was not helpful and offered nothing for the mess I received.
__label__1 disapointing: This pillow is super tiny and a big disappointment.It does not provide adequate support or relief from the discomforts of pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead and I wasted my money.
__label__2 Great headset: I've tried other bluetooth headsets and the biggest problem I've had is not being able to hear others from my car with all the road noise. The Plantronics 665 is great. In fact I actually had to turn down the volume a bit. I also noticed it connects instantly to the phone where my old Motorolla had a slight delay. I would have given this 5 stars except a lot of background noise is picked up by those on the other end of the line. Overall a very clean design. Other than the road noise, people on the other end didn't know I was using a wireless headset. Nice small design fit my ear well. The DC charging station/dock for the car is great. Charges as well from your PC USB. I'm using this with my Palm Treo 755p.
__label__1 Everyone who reviewed this movie is now my friend.: words cannot describe how bad this movie is.i think Troma would be embarassed for releasing this.
__label__1 damaged goods: The DVD stopped playing before the end of the first act. The subtitles stopped showing on the TV screen before the DVD stopped. This is probably a problem with the original recording because I had previously checked the same performance from the local Tucson public library and that DVD has the same problems.I tried to make a complaint to Amason on a different review request that Amason had sent me, but the return would not function.
__label__1 its not a slip cover!: u r surprized to see its not a slip cover, yes its not.wrong title, the product pkg title says its a furniture throw.If u need a long throw then this is for you. I liked the quality for the price though. If u r looking for a slip cover then stop donot buy this.
__label__1 Call a spade a spade: I really didn't understand the marketing of this book. Reading the book, I kept wondering "where's the beef?" I expected information that was useful but instead all I found was an autobiography that not only wasn't what I was looking for, it was boring.
__label__1 Complete waste of money: There are clearly design flaws in the charger and the batteries. I have yet to have any otherof my other rechargeable batteries read 0 volts and not take a charge. Several of myDigiPower batteries are basically useless (and they were expensive).At some point the charger fails and doesn't seem capable of detecting that the batteries need tobe charged. You insert spent batteries into the charger and the charge light blinks for 5 minutesbefore going off. The batteries are not charged.Took me a while to figure out why my camera did not operate for very long on these batteries.Spend a lot of $$ on DigiPower batteries and have the most dead batteries of any brand I've purchased.I eventually figured out that the remaining good DigiPower batteries could be charged in oneof my older chargers. It's not clear whether the charger is killing the batteries but othershave reported similar results.The circuitry to prevent overcharging in this charger is clearly not functioning.
__label__2 Must have a steady hand!: I have found results up to 150 yards to be ok for hand holding. Past 150 you need to rest the Rangefinder on either a cart, Push cart, or even a tree. A monopod would also solve this problem. It does as advertised and has made a huge difference in my approach shots. You will quickly find some markers at your local course could be off as much as 20 yards. Pine trees work out to be the easiest to get a reading from though still difficult past 300 yards. After much research this is the best for the buck. Would highly recommend.
__label__1 Spelling Bee study aid is disappointing.: This product is good in that it allows users to enter their own spelling words. It is disappointing because the study games do not require a user to spell the words only to recognize them among incorrectly spelled words or to add a missing letter. If the program does not already contain the words you intend to add you will need the hardware to add the correct pronunciation. Personally, I'd like a more stripped down spelling study aid that would drill words from custom lists.
__label__1 too many lame jokes: If you took all of the lame jokes out of this book, it would only be about 30 pages long. I recommend the beginner's book from the Microsoft Press. It covers the same topics more thoroughly and doesn't treat the reader like a third grader.
__label__2 MD quality rules: MDs are as virtual-CD in sound quality as my ear can detect. The software usually operates smoothly, too.
__label__1 Total .....!: Don't waste your money on this trash. I swear it seems as if the friends of the makers were the people giving commentary, not "insiders", or experts. These folks couldn't even formulate a proper sentence. This is a total effort to take Alicia's fans for their money. Alicia acknowledged this DVD herself in one of her own Diary entries at her site. It's rubbish.
__label__2 best classic ever: omg lol I have been searching for this for a long time, thank you alot. I am a very big Final fantasy fan and now cause of this i own every final fantasy there is :P am so happy and you rock, peace
__label__1 Hand Roll Piano not a good midi device for electronic Musicians: The timing on using the roll up piano as a the midi controller was a joke. The response time was so slow, there was a full second between pressing the key and hearing the note inside of Cubase and Sonar.You also could not turn off the internal sounds of the rollup piano. I had to plug in headphones just to shut of the sounds to hear my VST plugin patch.
__label__1 Not using it!: When you insert the clip into the RD. Then try to install or hook onto your visor. I crushess the buttons and it makes the screen of the RD not visible. Good try but not useful. Sorry!
__label__2 Attention getting - couldn't put it down.: After having read Savannah, I had to continue the quartet. By the time I finished reading To See Your Face Again I almost felt I knew the characters personally. I had to go to my local library to find Before the Darkness Falls and I am so glad I did. In my opionion, this is the best of the quartet. When I finished it, I had to find out more about the families. I have even gotten information about the characters on the internet to learn more about their lives. This book leaves one needing more - it's just that spellbinding.
__label__1 High Price - Minimal Play: My 5.5 year old daughter received this from Santa 2005. After literally 2 minutes of play, she said "this is boring, it doesn't do anything". The price is high for $34.99. It comes with a pair of shoes & a comb. After changing the color on the eyelids & mouth a few times, that's it. The additional outfits are pricey at $9.99 each & hard to find. We returned this for Littlest Pet Shop. As others have said - the face does look weird.
__label__1 Wow..: Okay..If I hear anyone say this band is punk one more time I'm going to shoot myself in the head. This group of women may be talented, depending on who you ask, but they AREN'T punk. They aren't even POP-PUNK. Group this in with Avril Lavigne and Good Charlotte. This is just another chick band that tried to break through into mainstream by playing 'punk' music and failed. They destroyed the Romantic's hit "That's What I Like About You." I'm not gonna make this a "I'm more punk than you" review. Hell, I liked the Halo Friendlies song "Me Vs. The World," but this is too pop for me. If you are one of those chicks who thinks you're a punk rocker and listens to Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, this is for you. Have fun, poseurs.
__label__1 A unecessary gimmick: For some reason when I saw this, I thought I needed it. I thought I'd actually need to grind pepper with one hand while stirring with the other. Turns out, I didn't.The levers have kind of a mushy feel to them and don't take any less hand strength to squeeze than twisty a well-made traditional pepper mill. For people who have serious hand strength issues, a top quality battery operated mill is the way to go. The grind is too coarse and comes out in a wide swath. The overall piece in thin plastic that seems destined to melt if placed too close to the stove.After about a year I donated it to charity and purchased a traditional style William Bounds stainless steel mill. It's much better.
__label__2 Exactly what I expected and wanted.: I know this film had lousy reviews but I love the graphics and the music so for me it was a good purchase. My 8 year old granddaughter had a birthday party with under the sea theme so she enjoyed this as well. Not for everyone though.
__label__2 Great collection...: Chick Webb was one of the fathers of this style of swing drumming. This is a great collection, especially if you appreciate the historical context in which the tracks were recorded. The sound is suprisingly good. Check it out!
__label__1 hand lens: I bought two of these lenses for my husband and he threw them away because the print was wavey. would not spend the money for them again...unusable.
__label__1 hoses are way too short: The hoses that connect to hot and cold taps are only about a foot long? Unless your taps come out directly beneath the sink you'll need some kind of extension to install this. If I ever get it installed I'll update my review. Turns out the local DIY stores don't sell an "extension" Had to mate 2 hoses and several connectors together but installation is complete. The old feeds on the old faucet were easily twice a long. This is a surprising problem. Unless the distance from you faucet to your hot/cold taps are 10 inches or less I wouldn't buy this. That said it looks nice and it works now. Still only 2 stars for leaving the feeds so short.
__label__1 if you have a non-wide-angle adapter, saw 2 slots off: I thought it would have been a better idea to buy this instead of hack off the first two slots of a regular cokin adapter because it shows up on my 17mm Sigma lens. The build quality isn't as good. The regular cokin adapter has nice rounded edges. This adapter looks like it was cut w/ a sharp blade on the front (including the sharp edges) but is slightly different in the back; I fixed the sharp edges w/ sandpaper :-)I wish someone would make an inexpensive alternative wide angle adapter that goes closer to the lens w/o needing to buy an expensive $70 Lee filter holder...
__label__1 Not her best: I was hoping for better when I bought this CD, but I found that it more boring than uplifting.
__label__2 Cell signal booster works!: Product works as advertised. Had a crappy (1 bar) connection inside my rural home. Dropped calls routinely. After installation (on my roof), I have 3-4 bars in half my 1800 sf home and 1-2 bars in other half (farthest from indoor antenna).Haven't had a dropped call since install.
__label__2 Best new drama series this year: Both actors in this new series are favorite actors of mine. This series is also different than any of the new series introduced lately. I hope this series endures for awhile. I cannot recommend this series highly enough.
__label__1 As bad as people say!: "The Conqueror most certainly lives up to its billing as one of the most ridiculously awful films ever made. It's absurd casting and over-the-top, faux, Shakespearean dialogue has to be seen to be believedThere is a story about members of the cast and crew later succumbing to cancer because this movie was filmed near a former atomic bomb testing area. It's an interesting story, but there really is no evidence that radiation exposure caused any of the deaths. There is a far more mundane explaination- the victims were all chain smokers. In fact, when the Duke was making "The Alamo" he was allegedly smoking six packs a day! Smoking like that will kill you as sure as working on an atomic test site.
__label__1 Midnight Magic: This book was not one of Gwynne Forster best books, I was very disapointed. What happen Ms. Forster. The book just went on and on about the same old thing. Not a good read.
__label__1 Dro not buy for outside: Will not now on grass. Handle to short for kids over 2-3. Poorly made, was really disappointing. Unhappy little guy with this toy.
__label__1 Sorry: I kept waiting for a plot to arrive and one never did. A guy goes around mindlessly killing people and then collects stamps. And then the book ends, which I find to be the best part. It's finally over. Pointless.
__label__1 Try Again John!!!: I read the Summons in about 3 days. It was boring and the end was even worse than the entire book. I am a huge Grisham fan and I believe he was asleep when he wrote this! He is so very capable of 110% better work. I really did not care what happened to Ray in this book. What's up with Nathan Bedford Forrest...Forrest Gump??? It was not a thriller at all...like I'm used to. There was really no suspense. Usually, Grishman's books are hard to put down. I know that he can write better that this. Try again John!!!!
__label__1 Worse Display Ever: Advertising the display is the last thing creative people should consider because dispite its tiny bit higher of resolution, you won't be able to see anything under daylight. Say when you are walking on the street during the day and you wanna switch a song, I can gaurantee that you won't see a thing on the screen. The high resolution can only be seen well when you are in complete darkness. The processor is also insanly slow, can't believe this item can still exist under this kind of rediculous price!
__label__1 Not what it used to be......: Maidenform style #7959 used to be a fuller coverage bra that was perfect for under T-shirts because it was a smooth cup with slight padding which formed to your own shape. I have 6 that are wearing out and was so happy to see the style on this website for a great price. I was very disappointed when I received this package and the demi version is a completely different bra marketed under the same style # as the ones I bought at a department store. This new style is an oddly molded half bra that doesn't look natural under clothing - creating points where there shouldn't be any. I've worn the same size and style for many years, and this product did not live up to the standard.
__label__1 amazons: A Word Child: I just couldn't get into this book. I kept reading long past where I should have quit hoping it would pick up, because it never did.
__label__1 Clay Aiken Who?: That's right. With music like this he's already forgotten. And to Mr. A music fan from Phila, Pa, Clay Aiken's album was released at a time when there was no other competition. Hello!!! Noone good or really popular anyway is releasing albums at this time, so sure he'll be #1. I'd like to see him go up against Eminem, 50 Cent, Norah Jones, or even Britney will smoke him in sales and she can't even sing. So keep reading , Mr. Music Fan from Philly a.k.a "Loser", those same two and only two magazines that like Clay. By the way, my radio stations doesn't play crappy music like yours.
__label__1 Sit and STand review: I am a mother of 2 with a 4 year old and a 5 month old and purchased this to give my older one a place to sit when we are at the mall or museum. I have since returned it. First of all if you are on an all day outing, your littlest one will need to sleep which you cannot due since the seat doesn't recline enough. Secondly it was AWFUL to push. It was heavy and bulky and I found myself not wanting to use it. Third for a super delux stroller shouln't it have cup holders, I mean if I am going to lug and push this monstrosity shouldn't it have a place for the water you need after pushing it. All in all I am still looking for something...but I wouldn't waste you money on this one just get a double with those easy wheels and call it a day.
__label__2 Soars!: The peregrine falcon is a beautiful, noble bird known for its keen eye sight, keen intelligence and speed in flight.This stuffed replica of this magnificent bird will certainly be a hit with ornithologists, falcon lovers and people who appreciate the artistry in such detailed stuffed toys.
__label__2 An insider's view of medicine not found anywhere else: I have been a PJ reader since its inception. I eagerly await every issue. As a practicing physician it helps keep me sane by serving as a reality check. Am I the only one thinking these thoughts? Apparently not - PJ is right there beside me, publicly saying what I would never dare outside of the doctors' lounge. Simply put,it's the best medicine for those who practice medicine.Dr. Farrago has boldly gone where no doctor has gone before. Get this book and ride along with him!
__label__2 A Fabulous Set: Dec.7/03PJ Peake: (Nickname Bobbie)I have this set and it is great!! Aside from the CDs, There is aHard Cover book with Photos and the story of the songs. This bookis the size of the box (Very large). I would rate it 5 as it isgreat. It is the 3rd and last large set each with a hard coverbook. If you are a Frankie Laine fan...you will love it!!!
__label__1 Ho-hum: The plot has potential, but the writing is trite, and leaves me wanting. The author does too much telling and not enough showing.
__label__1 Awkward: These gloves felt awkward to me and I didn't really car for them. I ended up just lifting without.
__label__1 hoyabird, I agree. Harvard calculus ...: ...P>I don't have a Ph.D. from Harvard either, but I should be getting one next year.I have had to teach an introductory calculus course at Harvard that follows the "Harvard Calculus" treatment that originated with this book (though the course did not use this book). It was awful. It is no easier to teach this course than it is to learn from it. Students need to learn calculus first *before* applying it to the various fields they will study.
__label__2 not for beginners: I have been practicing yoga for only a few months. I am definitely a beginner. I enjoy doing this DVD, because for me it is extremely challenging. However, if you don't have much experience, you may feel a bit inadequate. The students seem to know which poses to do before the instructor even says them. I, on the other hand, had to look at the tv often to see what exactly they were doing, and that made it difficult to keep up. Plus, at 75 minutes, it may be a bit long for someone who is not already well conditioned.If you definitely want to be challenged, and won't mind watching a room full of people doing things to a much higher level than you can do, then purchase this DVD.Beryl is a wonderful teacher, and I'm sure that if you have the patience to keep doing the practice, you will do things you never thought were possible with your body.
__label__1 Okay.: This is okay but I didn't want all this added features such as listening to music or playing movies since I bought this to play games.
__label__1 Old techniques = Useless techniques: Unfortunately, Tom Hopkins is a victim of his success of the 1980s. This used to be a great reference book for selling. Sadly, that is no longer true. Buyers are so used to dealing with the techniques mentioned here that the buyers can actually get angry when these selling strategies are attempted. Everybody knows these closes and has heard them for years. If you as a salesperson want to master your craft, you need to drop the old image of a 'peddler.' If you attempt the tricks in this book, you'll brand yourself as an amateur. Save your money on this one, it's old news.
__label__2 Just what I expected: I have purchased this game for my son 7th birthday and it is great, he enjoys playing with it. I would recomend this game to parents for their children.The only problem I had is that the package took more time than expected but otherwise its great.l
__label__2 Excellent extras: First of all 'The Shining' is one of the best horror movies of all time. Terrifying and chilling. What makes this DVD even better is the extras. seeing the original advertisements and trailors brings back memories. The documentary of behind the scenes by Kubrick's daughter who features Shelly Duval, Scatman Crothers, Danny Lloyd, and Jack Nicholson on the set in between scenes and during rehearsals is very rare and very good.
__label__2 Pure Poetry!: Instead of reading this book for plot, try reading it as a poem, in book form. The book paints emotions and images and experiences that are wonderful to feel. These things are so much more important than the plot, in which the Spanish don't show up until the last five pages. This is a book about naming and being and growing up. It is excellent for adults (I agree that this is not exactly a children's book, although some children might understand it) who are dreamers, who dream of becoming a rock or a breath of wind.
__label__1 Tray is Ok, but wrong hinges: The hinges shipped with the product do not match the ones shown in the product image.
__label__1 Problems and no support: I have seen some reviews complaining about the quality of CDs and since I had this problem too, I wanted to make it visible. Tried my DVDs on 4 different computers which never had any problem with any heavier games, they would only work in one and only 2 of the 4 games. In fact the game behaves as if the CDs were not recognizable/authentic. It "ignores" them.Support outside the US is a subcontractor which basically makes you test the hell out of everything, upgrade firmwares and all kinds of stuff until you give up. And I gave up after 3 weeks. In the meanwhile you go to the forums and learn there were some bad manufacturing batches of DVDs but no one ever tried to check if mine were in those batches.My kid is very disappointed and so am I with this bad support. The 2 games I managed to start are fine though especially because the Star Wars magic is in there.
__label__2 bug light bulb: Purchased exact replacement bulb for my bug light and was able to use Paypal to pay for it. Very convenient!!
__label__2 The Right Mix of Suspense and Romance: This movie is great for those looking for a suspenseful, romantic flick.The musical score is great!
__label__1 RIDICULOUS!!!!!: This ridiculous movie is a total disgrace. There is absolutely no truth to ANY of it whatsoever! To label it as a "documentary" is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, just to lure in Elvis fans, and it is illegal. Anyone with a brain can tell that it is NOT Elvis singing or talking in this movie. Don't waste your time or money buying this dumb movie.Joel Gilbert, you are a disgrace to the film industry and Elvis fans everywhere to create such nonsense about the greatest entertainer and human being of all time. SHAME ON YOU!!
__label__2 Well worth the wait.: After many years of anticipation and uncertainty, The IM has at long last given the world the gift of another collection of wonderful songs. The music has progressed into subtle maturity, weaving gentle accoustics and mild harmonies together with slight organs and mood driven electric guitars. Karen's lyrics have come straight from her soul, and her voice has never been closer to the listener's ear. Cheers, IM. Ya done real swell. So glad you're back. We we're missing you. GP
__label__1 Great picture, poor quality: I love putting puzzles together with my son, and we were excited to go from the 100 piece puzzles to the 200 level. It's unfortunate, however, when the challenge of the puzzle arise more from poor construction rather than the actual difficulty of piecing it together.We always purchased Melissa and Doug floor puzzles in the past, but this regular sized jigsaw puzzle is a disappointment. I really had to force the pieces, which made it difficult to determine whether they really belonged together. Many pieces were bent, and the puzzle did not want to lay flat on the table. Pulling it apart was no simple matter either. All in all, I'm sure we'll work on it a bunch of times because of the great train picture, but I doubt it will last long since we have to pry the pieces apart so much and I don't think I'll be sad to see it go.
__label__2 SHOULD HAVE BEEN TEN STARS: Five stars doesn't begin to describe the writhing kundalini snake of energy that this can will unleash on you, the unsuspecting consumer. Be prepared to move mountains.
__label__2 Witty snapshot of relationships among decadent academics: When I first saw this film I was a faculty member at a Canadian universty- the insights on society and relationships are hilarious and ring true.
__label__1 Great start, but slows to a crawl . . .: The first 80 pages (paperback) are top-rate, fast-paced action. Then it slows to a crawl while Logan tries to develop his characters. This is NOT a "page turner". Take your time, and you'll be matching the pace of this book. It picks up again about page 300 or so.And the action descriptions in the coldest night in Minnesota history is not as dramatic as I expected. Other reviewers hype this book too highly. It's "okay", but no match for James Patterson or Alastair McLean.
__label__1 Battleship Sunk! or not...: I purchased this zircon because I was cheap and just wanted something to help me find a stud instead of knocking on the wall and listening to the subtle noises of finding a stud. I met my match trying to listen to find the studs in the ceiling trying to install a hyloft. I would it against the ceiling and hold the button and slide it across. Then the light would illuminate and I assumed I struck gold. A couple of strokes with the hammer and my nail was falling out. I tried it many times and it just wouldnt find a stud. Maybe it found imaginary studs but my ceiling definately has random holes along the top now
__label__1 Quiet? Hardly.: I guess you all have a different standard of what "quiet" means.This thing is really loud. Yes the fans seem to be good quality so you don't hear any mechanical noise at all. The problem is just that even the lowest setting is blowing an awful lot of air, so you hear a "whooshing" sound. It's okay during the day, but for sleeping it should really have a lower setting.Also it is very large, about the size of a room air conditioner or mini-fridge.My guess is the sound volume of this thing is in the range of 30-40 dB , and it should be 20-30 dB. For comparison, a good quiet PC fan is in the 10-20 range.
__label__2 So Far, So Good: Haven't used them much, but I'm pretty pleased. The only complaint is having to manually tune them yourself, or else there will be tons of static. Great price. Not sure you can get a better pair for less money.
__label__1 This Video is SICKINING.: I have seen this video and think pictures like that should be banned. Nobody wants to be involved in scenes or violence like that. People who think this is cool, are SICK. This is the most disgusting one of the series. Videos like this are one of the points for the violence in our society.
__label__1 terrible: i love the show but the dvd release is bad. i own the huge cylon head editions and now some of the discs do not work and two split in my hand. why universal would want to use gold coated flippers on an expensive set is beyond me. one can't even get the discs out of there hubs.
__label__2 If you stumbled accross these...buy them: This is one of those silly little products that once you own it, you use it much more than you think you will. I used them to pinch off the gas line while working on my lawn mower, hold a cable while working on the carburetor of my dirt bike, and all kinds of stuff. Like a 3rd hand. For a buck or two, it's worth it. Buy one.
__label__1 so-so with very long running scenes: The fight scenes were realistic, but short compared to the time they spent filming her run after bad guys or the really long time she spent getting away from the police in the first chase with little to no action.The movie should of been titled "The Running Girl".The music was awful as well, presumably in an effort to make up for the lack of dialogue and the main characters extremely bad acting skills.With the number of "A" list actors in the cast, the movie should of been a lot better, but they appeared to sleep walk through the thing.
__label__1 unbelieveabley bad: I kept reading and thinking this has got to get better. It doesn't. Even for a summer "beach read" where you don't have very high expectations, this hits a new low. You would have to take notes to keep all the characters straight in the first 50 or so pages. Then you find you really don't care. I have never read either of these authors before but you can be sure I will never pay money for any book with either of their names on it again. This must have been written as some kind of joke. How did this get published?
__label__1 B-O-R-I-N-G: I haven't even finished the book as of this time, but I can already tell that it will be boring. Is for the bit that I have read of it, It is very confusing and boring. I would not reccomend it and if you are a teacher, I would make your kids read something else, and not put them through the long, boring, confusing story of the Pearl. I rest my case.
__label__2 If You Care About Being Informed: Whether you want the advantage in winning a fantasy baseball league or simply want to sound intelligent when discussing the sport of baseball, this book provides unbelievably in-depth analysis found no where else, and does so in an often humorous way.
__label__1 read carefully: Beautifully written pan-Serbian novel. Not to be read as an unbiased history of the region or a tool for insight into the causes behind the war against Bosnia.
__label__1 "I Wanna Know...: have you ever tried to lay an egg in a swamp?" This is asked by a nun after a nude bodybuilder bends over and farts at her. This moment is topped when a stark-naked Sally Kirkland compares her breasts to "bobbing, blood-shot eyes." Interested yet? No? How about watching a scene in which a nude man masturbates in a bird cage? Good grief. As one reviewer noted, this is an original film. And in truth, I've never seen anything like it. And hope not to again. Ridiculous and tedious in every way imaginable, this is an unmitigated mess. I can easily believe it took years to make. The director and producers must have been turning in soda bottles for nickels because I can't imagine anyone would want to finance this with his own money.
__label__1 Not Very Good: I had a lot of hope for this movie after seeing it compared to "Man Bites Dog". For anyone who has seen this comparison to a genuinely great film, it is WAY off. This comes off more like a film school project from people with a couple of friends who were interns at a special effects company.The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because there were a few genuinely disturbing moments that will be hard to forget.If you're into the "August Undergroud" movement (poor/no direction, amateur actors, nasty-looking female actresses getting snuffed), maybe this will be up your alley. If you're looking for a quality film, look elsewhere.
__label__2 Battery minder: I purchased one of these about 1 year ago. I've used it over the past winter as a battery trickle charger for a vehicle that I use rarely, and it did an excellent job of keeping the battery charged. I placed this panel in a temporary position so that the sun only landed on it each afternoon, but that was sufficient for what I was trying to accomplish. This season, I'll do something different with mounting and wiring in order to make it a more permanent addition to my garage. I did read the previous reviews here and did also find that the packaging and shipping was perhaps a bit weak; however, my panel arrived in perfect shape and has worked reliably since.
__label__1 False advertising encouraged by Amazon: I received this from a third party seller. It was not an SACD - as advertised - but a stereo rip-off from some US CD franchise. Seems it was distributed under license from BIS and the seller did disclose this in the 'fine print' but Amazon did not alllow them to sell it with other than the [Hybrid - SACD] tag at the end of the title. So, I don't blame the seller, but buyer beware!
__label__1 Minimal protection. NO heat resistance.: I have one of these for my 6'6" Rusty.The sock fits well and is easy to put on and take off when the board is dry.Negatives:1. If your board is even a little wet, the sock is sticky and is very hard to put on and take off.2. There is almost no protection value of the sock. If you drop the board or knock it against something, you will crack the fiberglass.3. There is NO sun/heat protection. If you leave a surfboard in this bag in you car or in the sun (even on your roof rack), the surfboard will bake and yellow the foam and even delaminate the glass if you have an epoxy board.Do yourself a favor and get a real board bag like a Dayrunner or Dakine deluxe to protect your surfboard.The sock cover is best at protecting your board from dust.If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up with the voting buttons below!Thanks.
__label__1 Wrong edition from what I ordered: I ordered the 3rd edition and received the second edition. I punched in the Isbn number and ordered the 3rd edition and instead receive the second edition. Only answer I get back is return if unsatisfied. I would of liked them to also say they were shipping the correct edition also.
__label__2 excellent!: Great toy!! My son absolutely loved all of the sounds and activities this table has to offer! I recommend this toy for 1 year olds!
__label__2 Moving and Beautiful: This was quite an interesting book. Although I found it to be quite difficult, I found myself connected to the struggle that bestows the characters. How their past greatly scars their future, and how they continue to live with it is remarkable. Going into the mind of an ex-Afican-slave has to be one of the most unbelievable masterpieces in the history of novelsas it is portrayed in Beloved. Toni Morrison is one of the few great novelist of our time.
__label__2 I'm a purist: Okay, first, I'm angry because the original FF concept has been jettisoned for something different -- a la Spiderman, in fact.But then it occurred to me: the original FF was almost 50 years ago, from a time so quaInt, 6-year-olds wouldn't buy it.With that in mind, it's not bad.Jessica Alba is NOT Sue Storm. Sorry. ain't gonna happen, she's cute and all but NOT Sue Storm.Failing that, the cast isn't too bad.The special effects are necessarily 21st-centuy in nature, since this could not have been done 10 years ago.So four of five. I'd still like to see a faithful adaptation, but not likely.
__label__2 Great replacement balls for Cariboo game!: These are exactly what I was looking for to replace missing balls from the Cranium Cariboo game! We also tried using other calls but couldn't find any that were the same size. Now I also have extra put away in case we lose any more!
__label__2 good for a test strip: I use them as a quick check, and if anything is out of spec I will run a liquid test kit to see what corrections to do
__label__1 Talk about a downer!: I was really disappointed in this Oprah pick. I'm not sure that I will be able to force myself to read the last 30 pages that are remaining in the book because I am really getting tired of all the mess ups that everyone is making in the book. Kathy goes into a downward spiral that isn't totally believable. And what's up with Lester? He started out being pretty ok but has lost all reasoning to give up a family and career in a matter of days. I don't buy that. I liked the book at the beginning but about 1/3 of the way through it got so slow and boring that I've only continued to read it in an effort to get a return on the purchase price. Sorry Oprah!
__label__1 When the Sun Goes Down: I will have to be honest- it was a true disappointment. None of the songs seem to really stand out on their own.I just felt Kenny threw together a CD for the College crowd and young girls that seems to be his following to just to market another CD.It really had no substance as far as I am concerned. This CD does not compare to his others.The only song I thought was somewhat decent was:There goes my Life.
__label__1 JUNK !!!: Have had this 7410 for six months. It scans slow. It rarely will scan to Winfax. The software boo boos about every other time scan wise and must unplug replug. Ink is expensive. Software is absolute junk and makes it almost impossible to use your own scanning software. Card reader is OK. Copying is OK.
__label__1 mediocore: it isn't a scary movie at all. i saw it in class and i thought it was realy funny, because its kind of reflecting all the wrong things that happen today. i wouldnt really recomend watching it but seeing alot of them really gave me the creeps nate
__label__2 Good Price / Effective Product: This is a safe and effective guitar wax product ... no need to buy anything more expensive ... Planet Waves does a really good job with offering quality products for good prices ... everything I've purchased by Planet Waves has been a good value ...
__label__2 WOO HOO! Finally!: I have a glorious marriage. I love my husband and we have a wonderful life together. Coming from a dysfunctional family (to say the least) I had no idea how the whole family thing was supposed to be done. I cried out to the Lord and He planted little nuggets of wisdom in my soul. Then I find the Pearl's materials. WOW! If I could have written a book on marriage and family this would be it! I have several copies, they are great gifts as well. If you need help in your marriage, PLEASE READ THIS BOOK. It will make all the difference in the world. Some will say that she blames the woman for everything- that is not true, she just lets you know what YOU can do to change your marriage. Michael Pearl is writing a book for the men. She,being a woman, is speaking to the women about things they can do.
__label__2 Great Sylvia Syms: This CD is not easy to find since it was released on a smalllabel but do your damnedest to find it. Just to hear her sing"Fifty Per Cent" a classic from BALLROOM. She sings the song as if it were a three act play and tears your heart out. Miss Syms reallyunderstands the lyrics and even oddball choices like "YellowBird" and "Nice and Easy" are terrific.
__label__1 Forced to purchase by our breeder: We were made to purchase this food from our breeder in order to pick up our puppy. We had hopes of just keeping our new puppy and switching our yorkie to this food. Unfortunately, our puppy was pooping close to 5 times a day and was always SO hungry. We also noticed our yorkie scratching a lot more pooping a lot more. Our vet told us it appeared that the reason our pups were pooping so much more was that they weren't absorbing what that needed to from the food and it was a being flushed out of their system. Our yorkie actually LOST weight on this food and our new pup demonstrated allergies and we were afraid of resulting malnutrition. Please don't waste your time on this food. Dogs need completely different nutrition than humans.
__label__1 Room 101: Gregory MacNamee's average mind is very annoying, this book is about a precursor of PSYOPS the "psychological operations" of the U.S. military and Madison Avenue. The Jesuits inquisition was using torture instruments for similar purposes, cultural genocide.
__label__1 Please don't waste you money: Their is very little detail and almost no backroads inc with this software, if you check out google earth or maps you will find 10 times more info and their not even selling you a product its their free. Its a crying shame that this company is still in business with the poor excuse for support and software design and usability.
__label__1 Different region?: Received the item quickly and couldn't beat the price but, it will not play on our DVD player. Goes through the motions and then the "different region" pops up. Received from a dealer in Great Britain. Did not realize there was a difference. Will have to return. Review given was for "You Can't take it with you" - sorry, my mistake.
__label__2 Moving songs from a great songwriter and singer: This was one of the first CD's by Ray Boltz that I bought and that was way back before 2002!Ray Boltz is definitely up there with Michael Card and Dallas Holm as far as writing great lyrics are concerned. He also has a great voice and style of singing.This album contains many great songs from the upbeat and beautiful 'Here comes a miracle' to the profound and solemn 'Watch The Lamb'. The song 'Watch the Lamb' puts you right there in Jerusalem during the crucifixion of Jesus and is absolutely heart wrenching. I believe that songs like these (including 'The Hammer') are ones that can bring a non-believer to Christ.My other two favourites are 'Shepherd Boy' and 'You Will Always Be a Child' and the closing song 'Take up your Cross' is very challenging and always reminds me that Jesus expects me to follow Him wherever he leads.If you are looking for a great Christian album, this is it!
__label__1 Absolutely Infuriating: I could go on and on about how much I hate this book. The arrogance, the narrow-mindedness, the self-pity.I'm definitely what people would describe as a "geek" (unless I'm not "counter-culture" enough for you), yet I absolutely hated everyone I read about in this book. Apparently, from what Katz tells us, we are to believe that geeks are super special superhumans who are just too good for ordinary people. Well, guess what - geeks aren't really that unique! Yes, I personally think that they are more interesting and are people I would more likely want to be friends with, but I could hardly go around espousing it as fact.
__label__2 Works For me: Hard to review when there are so many variables. This won't work for you if Your body still produces normal levels of melatonin, making this superflous. Or you have other issues (stress, apnea, environmental issues) way beyond the ability of melatonin to help. I can't compare with any other melatonin since this is the only one I have used. I can only say it has worked well for me. I find myself getting to sleep quicker and sleeping more soundly.
__label__2 You will learn so much: You will learn a lot about the animals that live in the desert. Very educational and interesting. Love it!
__label__2 Inception: This was a real thriller--kept you riveted to the story all the way through it. It takes you deeper and deeper into a dangerous level of the dream world--a level from which you may never return. What's real...and what isn't?
__label__2 Pure Class: I used to think Destiny's Child were the most annoying group ever. Just another r+b female group cranking out forgettable songs. But when I heard this song Emotion, WOW, I totally gained a new found respect for them. This song is so beautiful, they sing it beautifully...the whole thing just has CLASS written all over it. Good job ladies. Oh yeah, I also have to admit that I also like Bootylicious as well :P
__label__2 Highly Recommended; I Use It In Class: I can't recommend Andrew Sullivan's "Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con" highly enough.It's an anthology, and the pieces excerpted do exactly what the title says: they provide a reader into pro and con positions in the same sex marriage debate. Sullivan is very fair. He really does present a variety of points of view.The reader is so thorough, after you've read it, you may realize that it would be hard to say anything new on the topic.In addition to being useful, I found the book fascinating. It's intriguing to read of how marriage between persons of the same gender was conceived long ago in China, or in Medieval Europe. I do use the book in classes I teach, but I also enjoyed reading it.
__label__1 Horrible: Absolutely terrible. This is powerpoint presentation with audio dubbed over. Very unprofessional presentation, and reminds me of something a junior high student would produce. Save your money. It's impossible to understand the content of the video, as the presenter is unintelligible due to poor microphone quality.
__label__1 Good idea, wrong decade: Even though I don't own the device, it is easy to notice the idea is great and convenient, but carrying this thing around is just terrible.This thing costs a lot of money for its size and lack of color screen, so I am sure the experience is far from reading a "real book". And for 400 bucks, buy a laptop please.
__label__1 Poor Quality Sifter: I purchased two of these as gifts. Recently at my daughters I had opportunity to use it and was quite disappointed. It cannot handle 3 Cups much less 5 cups.
__label__1 Sick Joke Indeed!: Hardly a 200 page book but a few stapled pages with advice I've found in other less expensive admissions books! Definitely NOT impressed and most definitely NOT worth $50!
__label__1 Drivel: I agree with the reader from philadephia,Pa This is Christian Fundamentalist drivel. I finished every chapter thinking "...and your point is?" Epperson talks in circles without saying anything.
__label__2 Baby Taming: Absolutely the best, simple, and most humorous guide to baby rearing I've ever seen. I used it with my child and recommend it enthusiastically to any new parents.
__label__1 KitchenAid KFC3100: After one month of limited use the safety latch or pulse button will not allow the product to operate. I am returning this item.
__label__2 A View from Skokie: Speaking as someone who grew up in Skokie during the middle of this crisis, this movie brings back lots of memories and reveals things that I had no idea were going on. I was 10 at the time, and the only thing I remember hearing about it was that if it happened, we were to stay home, close the windows and blinds and ignore it. I had no idea of the violence and bloodshed that was forthcoming. Seeing this movie as an adult gave me a whole new perspective on it. I also got to see some friends I knew who were extras in it and some sights of the Skokie I once knew
__label__1 way way way to overhyped: this band was way to overhyped. They pull you in with awesome singles like on this cd Last Night which is awesome and the only reason I got this cd and then they put out 10 crappy songs to compliment their great songs. Wait 5 years before coming out with your next cd Strokes that way you can weed out the crap and come out with a decent cd because you can do it.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS GPS!!!!: Please save your hard earned dollars. I've owned this model for over 2 years and Magellan has provided absolutely no support. They've been saying they're going to have new topo maps since the day I bought it, and they've yet to deliver. From their web site it looks like they've discontinued this model.6/16/2010 Update to my previous review. Magellan have made it official now. Since they discontinued this model in December 2008, they are no longer providing map updates. The really sad thing is the last update they had for this model was V2 for 2006/2007. So it was out of date when I bought it and it will NEVER be updated. Not the type of company you want to buy from.Buy a Garmin!!!!
__label__1 Garbage!: I ordered this battery on October 12 and now, on November 27, the battery no longer holds a charge. I guess you get what you pay for or, in this case, even less.
__label__2 A true talent...you will not be disappointed!: A glimpse into the talents of a soon to be household name, Meredith combines both her singing and writing prowess together in this shocking debut. Her voice and knack for creating catchy, yet truely beautiful melodies make this album what it is...a harbinger of things to come, and a chance to get in on her career at the ground floor. But don't believe me...listen for yourself!
__label__1 A Thrill-free Ride!: I regret having to be a party-pooper, but the list of glowing Amazon reviews for this paltry sum of a book is unbelievable. Of the many rollercoaster titles out there, this has to be the most lackluster, primarily because the underambitious author set out ONLY to make a superficial guidebook that -- due to the ever-mutating coaster technology -- is already dated. Worse, the uninspiring black and white photographs fail to do these rides any justice. Most of them seem to have been culled from the same theme park publicity departments to whom the author (judging by the text) apparently ingratiated himself. As a history, it offers nothing but the same litany of facts stated again and again in such other -- much more engaging -- rollercoaster tomes as Robert Cartmell's groundbreaking THE INCREDIBLE SCREAM MACHINE. Be wise and look elsewhere on this site for other recommendations on books of this nature.
__label__2 Fits the use: Using the strap brought back good memories from 50years ago when I last played the bass clarinet when I!was at college.
__label__2 Family Favorite: I first heard this as a tape when my daughter was quite young. Our whole family loved it, my daughter used to sing Jelly Man Kelly with my husband every night when he came home from work. It was a staple in the car, and as the years have gone on has become the tape we play every summer as we head off for vacation. It is known as the "Avalon tape" for Avalon, NJ,and always brings to mind carefree days at the beach. It is definitely music for the entire family.
__label__2 Really good bag for one SLR: one SLR body (detached from lens) and 3-4 lenses or a speedlite can fit in this bag. there's a nice velcro patch on the left/right edges of the top flap to keep it closed if you've not buckled the lid down. two roomy pockets on the ends, one nice inner pocket for small doodads. very comfortable shoulder strap, a couple D-rings on the back side to attach it to another pack, and two cinch straps on the bottom to carry a tripod or whatever. It's a pretty good grab-and-go bag, although I no longer keep my SLR in this bag; it's been appropriated for holding telescope eyepieces and miscellany! I actually prefer this bag over the larger Canon backpack, but that one holds a lot more stuff and is easier to hike with. This bag is better suited for road trips and family events. If you don't feel the need for a backup SLR body and you don't need to have both hands free to scramble up a trail; get this bag, otherwise, go get the Canon backpack style; they're equivalent build quality.
__label__1 Works to Charge, not to Synch: This worked to charge my PDA but I could not use this to synch at all. Perhaps there is a way but I have not and do not have the time to figure it out. IF the cradle works this should work, I thought. I can only use this to charge.
__label__1 Sorry Joe: As someone with an interest in dreams and the unconscious I thought to give this one a chance. What a mistake! Joseph Cornell had some of the most boring dreams of all time. I think he must have been dreaming of a blank page. Since I already tossed the book out into the street I can't provide an example of the sparse jottings, few of which surpass even five lines, but let the buyer beware of the total lack of exciting content, symbolism or detail, and know upfront that their only enjoyment of this book will come from analyzing the well designed cover. Have a look at some of Cornell's other work instead, as these musings were never intended to see the light of day. Why this was put out by Exact Change I can't say.
__label__2 very cute bear: Cute, soft and durable. Not much else to say really. Just check it once in a while to make sure nothing is coming off .. nothing has.
__label__1 Ummmm....: Forget about the reviews helping me. Lets talk about helping Mr. Jordan. My advice? MAKE... SOMETHING... HAPPEN!!!! PLEEEASE!! For the love of God, if I have to wade through another novel where absolutely nothing exciting happens, I'm just going to start writing my own Wheel of Time novels. I think I'll start by reducing the number of proper names in the book from, like, A BILLION, to a more manageable number like, say, six. And I'll give them easy names like Bob or Mary. Oh, and I'll also remember to make the names vastly different instead of having three characters named Bob, Baub, And Borb. I swear, I spent the whole novel just trying to remember who the hell everyone was because the last one I read was during the Carter administration. Seriously, the first six books, were awesome, but I'm starting to wonder if even Robert knows where this series is going. After "Crossroads" I'm guessing no where.
__label__1 Great at making messes: I just brewed my fourth batch of coffee with this thing, only to discover coffee and grounds pouring over the side of the filter basket and all over my desk! What a mess... The culprit seems to be the little valve at the bottom of the filter basket that is supposed to open when the decanter is under it. Even though the basket and decanter were set fully in place, the valve didn't open. Upon careful inspection, it looks like the decanter has to be positioned exactly correctly on its hotplate to avoid this situation, i.e. you have to visually check that the valve is being pressed all the way upward prior to brewing.I have another, larger coffee maker with a "pause and serve" feature and have brewed hundreds, if not thousands of pots of coffee with it and never had an issue with the valve. This Cuisinart unit must be very poorly designed.
__label__2 Very nice quality: My four year old son really likes this puzzle board. The puzzle is bright and engaging and the pieces are quite sturdy.
__label__2 Response to FORVER MY HEART song: The most beautiful song I've ever heard ... ever! Texture of her voice, her delivery, the composition, production, arrangement, etc ... she's the greatest vocalist I've never heard ... until now!
__label__2 Both CDs were mislabeled: Both CDs are great live recording. Stan Getz Quartet played wonderfully.The Green CD was labeled as Disc Two "Spring Is Here", is wrong.It actually should be labeled as CD #1 (The Dolphin) and has 6 tracks on it.Then, the Red CD was labeled as Disc One "The Dolphin", is wrong.It should be CD #2 (Spring Is Here) and has 7 tracks on it.This mislabeling incident showed that Sony DADC manufacturedthem without quality control in place, and Concord Jazz -the musiclabel owner- also has no QC. It is annoying.
__label__1 Good Medical Advice, But No Theologian: I found this book to be useful from the point of view of good medical and nutritional advice, but was disappointed in the way Colbert frequently misunderstood or misused the scriptures. Bending scriptures and using them out of context is wrong, no matter what your good intentions are. I also was pretty startled to find that Colbert thinks that grace means we are now empowered to obey the law we were set free from. Did Paul misunderstand God when he wrote Romans and Galatians? There may be sound medical reasons to eat a kosher diet, but God made it abundantly clear that there are no spiritual obligations to do so.
__label__2 Agnes Parker...Girl in Progress: Book was purchased for my grandaughter for Christmas, so the book has not been read yet...however, great price and customer service, thank you!
__label__2 THE FINAL DESTINATION: I HAVE THE COLLECTION OF THIS MOVIE, I THINKS IT'S GREAT. I HOPE THEY MAKE MORE OF THE SERIES. I RECOMMENDED IT TO ALL VIEWERS.
__label__1 Totally ripped off: You only got a star because it was a mandatory field.Not only was the horrendous postage not clearly disclosed at point of sale, but the game when arrived was not compatible with Australian playstation consoles...something to do with PAL.We have all learned the enormous advantages of shopping locally.Thanks for the lesson.
__label__1 Foil cutter: Good, but not as good as the original. Sometimes the cutter wheels don't track together.
__label__2 They are great, but. . . .: First off, I love Rachel Ray, and I love most of her products. These pans are great for cooking, but. . . the only thing I don't like about them, is that the outsides (mainly the bottoms) stain really easily. The interiors are wonderfully easy to clean, but you really have to scrub the heck out of the bottoms of the pans. Maybe it is because I cook on a flatop stove, but if the slightest thing gets on the cooktop, it really imbeds itself into the bottom of the pans. I am afraid if I scrub them to hard I will ruin them. They really are wonderful for cooking though, I just wouldn't want to "display" them because of the splotches that imbed themselves on the bottoms. If anyone knows of a gentle cleanser that will help me get the bottoms cleaner, feel free to post.
__label__1 SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!: I thought that the album was, at best, mediocre. All of the songs sound the same, and it sounds like Beyonce's screaming/wailing throughout the album. The only song that's worth mentioning is "The Closer I Get to You" with Luther Vandross. Don't get me wrong, Beyonce has a good voice, but doing the solo album bit is not for her. Her music sounded a WHOLE lot better when she was with D.C. The only reason why she's sold so many albums so far is because of all of the marketing/promoting that they're doing for it. In a month or two, all of the "hype" should be over, and her CD will probably end up in a discount bin.
__label__2 Pink Floyd Rocks Out the Millenium: Pink Floyd The Wall is A Classic Rock and Roll Masterpiece written by Roger Waters. A story of Pink a burnt out rock star and his journey into Madness 2B released as a live album SoonShine On U Crazy Diamond <<<Rufus
__label__1 Tsk-Tsk!!!: 13 year olds singing about love and boyfriends and going on dates. It saddens me what this world is coming to...
__label__1 iamcde: What a piece of crap!!! Thank God I bought an extended warranty...too bad for the warranty company. There have been over $10,000 in repairs done to this unit, the original cost before warranty $2300. I don't travel much with it, it sits on a desk. They have replaced monitor 2x, the harddrive 2 or 3x, the cd/dvd drive 2x and it is still broken, the keyboard 1x, the motherboard 1x (that I know of), it blue screens weekly at least once sometimes 2 & 3 times and the battery has never worked. I contacted Sony and got no assistance from them. I don't recommend this unit to anyone...get an IBM!!
__label__2 CD review: This is a super recording we previously owned on vinyl. The sound is great and the performances, particularly the duets, are striking. We consider it a permanent part of our collection.
__label__1 Garbage: I must agree with other reviewers. I bought this "cleaning system" after installation of Bruce flooring. The flimsy plastic handle broke imeadiately. After I repaird and reinforced that, I tried using it. As others have said the head constantly flips when trying to apply the conditioner. The whole process is so combersome I found it easier to use a terry towell on my hands and knees.
__label__2 granny: product feels like silk when applying and a difference in noticed in just a few days. I will surely order this product again
__label__1 Too Much Gimmick, Not Much Substance: The theory of this book is that you can get through 1 chapter (concept) in one hour, then you take a quiz when your hour's up to make sure you got the concepts.The quizes are poorly worded. Any question that an "all-of-the-above" option, was ALWAYS "all-of-the-above". Worse than that is that the answers were in the back of the book with NO EXPLAINATION. Please at least tell me why "b" was the correct answer.I think the book brushed over some of the essential accounting concepts, while focusing on less important topics.I wish I would have never written in this book, but I guess I'm stuck with it now...
__label__2 Wireless Mouse and Keyboard: This looks great, and mouse is awesome, but so far, I have been unable to get the keyboard to snyc with the receiver, so I can't use it. I'll keep trying, and if I don't have any luck, I will call Microsoft Support for some help. Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated.
__label__2 This album is superb pallies!: David Gilmour can still come up with great musical riffs which was something that the dumbkuff Roger Waters[...] couldn't do. On an Island, whilst slower in pace than his last two solo records. My standouts here are the title cut, This Heaven, Where We Start and Take a Breath. To say that Bratananey Sneers would write better lyrics than Polly is like saying Ashlee Simpson is better than Neil Peart at lyrics California Coool a/k/a Slip and Slide. You are a k-nucklehead for degrading this. Buy now or HEEGOTCHA!
__label__1 This book shattered my enthusiasm: I looked forward to getting this book. I read studiously and with great hope that I would get into the "peacemaking" theme. I struggled to 'get it' and tried to enjoy it. It was so poorly organized that I wanted to skip the descriptions and names of people and places that didn't mean a thing to me. Finally, somewhere after the 'centerfold pictures', I gave up. This didn't give me any idea where his real money came from. How could he afford all this travel while tring to find 'backers' and resources? This was a great vocation but didn't share any of the real feelings the man experienced. I think he would have done better if he wrote his own story. This book didn't motivate me at all; and that's what I was looking for. I returned the book to the library gratefully; and I am not sorry I didn't finish it.
__label__1 unhappy: I don;t like it> It very difficult to put on. In addition, it makes my dresses too small. I would like to return it but I threw the bag away. I need some help returning those two items. Thank you
__label__1 It had its ups and downs: At times, I really liked the book. Then it got disappointing: especially since it was an assignment. My reccomendation? Skip it. There are a couple times when you can really get into it and then there are the more common times when you can barely stand it. Not worth it!
__label__1 Great TV but unreliable: This unit was I thought for the first two months a great bargin. Then it started recyling at turn on, then refused to turn on at all. All I got was a black screen and a blue light. Contacted Samsung and they said I needed service. Service never called or showed for appointment. Now I have a different service provider, TV has been down over a week and will be at least another one. Samsung is trying but In my over 60 years I never had a TV go out within 55 daysof delivery.
__label__2 Take Your Life Back: You have been giving your life away to your family, your job, the media, society, and you may not even realize it. This book gives you the tools to take your life back. Applying these tools daily, brings not only joy and happiness in the deepest way, you also will find that what you truly desire will become part of your experiences. You will feel in command of your life; you will be certain and capable about what you do, say, feel. You want your life back? Please, please read this book!
__label__2 Fabulous Camera: This is an excellent camera for anyone! I do professional photography and typically use a DSLR that was quite costly and of course not the kind of thing you can throw in your purse. This is a great camera to keep on hand for impromptu family events, or just have around the house. It has a point and shoot option, but also allows the photographer to control the settings as they would with a much more expensive camera. I would highly recommend also purchasing an external flash as the quality of your pictures will be noticeably improved. The only downside I have noticed is having to get used to the automatic focusing, but that is certainly manageable. Great great camera!!!
__label__2 YES: A fantastic product for the younger set in learning shapes and matching them to the correct place on the ball. On a limited basis, it may also get a child interested in learning colors on a basic level
__label__1 Suprise! It's a creationist book!: This little creationist book in disguise as a paleontology book is a dangerous piece of creationist babble. Not intended for those with weak minds.
__label__2 Created a new love for history: I'm not normally a big non-fiction reader, preferring rich literature to anything else, but while browsing through the local bookstore one day, I spied this on the shelf and was taken by the title. I spent about half an hour reading it there in the shop before I decided that I needed to by it, and then once I took it home I finished it in about 2 hours.This book is interesting, fascinating, often humorous, and although it has a couple places where it is more annoyingly feminist than necessary, it really is a good place to start for someone wanting to get a taste of this period of British history without worrying about being bored to tears. For me it has kicked off a new obsession with readies histories of all sorts (I just picked up a book about the Black Plague).Worth the time and money, for certain.
__label__2 . . . Sharon Gless & Kevin Dobson shine . . .: in this beautifully written romantic comedy . . . one not to be missed & sure to be enjoyed!
__label__1 Acts of Faith: Daily Meditations for People of Color: The condition of the book is poor and should not have been sold. It has water damage.
__label__2 The most beautiful book I have ever read: I'm Spanish and have never had much interest about America, for me it's too far away a land. However, after reading Into the wilderness I've become in love with the history and landscape of America and would love to make a journey there. I hardly slept during the days I was reading the book, I couln't stop reading and am looking forward to the second part. Sara Donati has done a good job
__label__1 I was taken hostage by Albanians: Before I was released I was given a choice. Listen to Shaq's greatest hits the whole way through or eat a bucket of dirty toenail clippings. I opted for the CD and half way through I wish I had chosen the bucket.So this is the 'best' of Shaq's albums huh? I would hate to listen to his B-sides.I can barely watch him struggle through a Burger King commercial never mind listening to him sing. I can't even understand him when he talks.
__label__2 All encompassing explanatory manual on mentall illnesses.: Every depressive will know the fears which hound us - "Is there really something biologically wrong with me or am I just weak, stupid or lazy by nature." It takes the clarity of this one-of- a kind book to show the conclusive biological evidence responsible for the mental chaos depressives suffer from. It leads through to sound medication choices followed by helpful advice on how to retrain a previously depressive mind set into a more positive direction.
__label__1 Skip this one!: Save your money. I guess the author wanted to capitalize on the DaVinci Code bandwagon. The plot is extremely lame. I found myself saying "come on" more than once. There are many other Templar novels much more interesting.
__label__1 Bad movie!: This movie was very superficial, we don't feel it real, it go to one situation to another without exploring it enough.
__label__2 Expansion & Conflict: This book does an excellent job of describing the tensions of our country as it grew in the early-mid 19th century. It brought up some interesting facts that I had never known, such as, serious discussion within key leaders of Congress in the 1840s that the U.S. should forcibly take Canada from Great Britain.
__label__1 Another Stephanie Laurens...: One of the most boring book I've read this year. The story revolves around 3 sisters, who all seemed just uninteresting. People you wouldnt care to know and there was way too much interaction between these gossipy sisters.....This book was a bit like regency chic lit, except it was really boring and without a hint of humor.Meet a heroine who is a book-wormy type, who wears glasses and who prefers dull, serious clothing. How very dull. The hero seemed interesting enough, and yet again unexciting because I didn't believe in their chemistry.If you enjoy what Stephanie Laurens is writing these days, you might actually like this book. I grab her books to read when I am trying to fall asleep. Yes, its that engaging.
__label__2 ribbons and trims: good condition. item as described. great book forlearning to make trims for dresses. good ideas
__label__2 A delightful surprise!: When I received this CD as a gift last Xmas, I was hesitant to play it- I was sure it would be full of droning, boring battle songs. BOY! Was I wrong! The songs in this album are little gems - true, they speak of war, but the songs, singing and playing are so contagious that I was soon singing along. This has become my favorite CD, and even my children love to sing along. Don't let the title "Civil War Songs" turn you off. This is well worth a listen.
__label__1 A screen play, not a novel: The characters are not even cardboard cut outs, the plot so implausible it makes the head swim, the action duller than dull but the six hundred page rebuttal to global warming interesting. Why couldn't this book be summarized in three pages? The world could have saved some trees.
__label__2 Dee Henderson delivers another excellent story.: Dee Henderson keeps you hanging on to what is going on in this story of secrets and what can happen when a lot of money is involved. There is heartache and joy as well as a lot of tension in the story. It will keep you going. This story does go into a little detail of what life can be like for someone who suddenly finds themselves with more money than many of us could imagine. The intrigue keeps the pages turning.
__label__1 Advertised but not available: I ordered it, waited weeks and then was sent a message, sorry not available.I can't comment on the item itself as it was probably as wonderful as the pictures looked, so my comments are only about something being advertised that could not be delivered.
__label__1 More "Rock" Than Geode: We bought these (despite other negative reviews) for our children's science share project on different types of rocks. The idea for the geodes was to crack one for the spectators (kids and their parents) every 15 minutes. When it was time for the first one, we just couldn't crack it, so my husband went outside in order to bang it harder. He went through at least 6 in order to get a couple to crack, but they were all solid (some little crystals but not much). We weren't able to have the "wow" factor of cracking open a geode and seeing the cool hollow inside with any of the geodes in this kit. It was very disappointing for my kids, and also for the kids coming around to hopefully see a geode opening in person. Thankfully we had lots of other specimens available from our own collection.
__label__1 Gas saving septic safe & soft enough!: We are first time owners of a country home on a septic system and needed to find the right toilet paper for both the septic system and our personal needs. This product does both. I adopted the auto-send option for a case of this Seventh Generation toilet paper which keeps us supplied and we don't have to think about it or hunt for sales and coupons. It is soft enough, all packaging is recyclable and if you are lucky enough to be able to store a case then I highly recommend this product and the auto-order option offered through Amazon.
__label__2 I like it: When purchased this carseat it was mainly to make a travel system because we already had the matching stroller. This carseat is very padded and very safe looking also the canopy is not very big so it really doesnot keep the sun out of the babies eyes and it is very heavy once my baby started to gain some wieght but with as much traveling as I do I would purchase it again beacuse of the comfort level.
__label__2 A must have for any children's book collection: This delightful, sweet, and incredibly illustrated book is our favorite. After a trip to the zoo we brought it home for our 3 and 1 year old to enjoy. The illustrations have amazing detail and capture such emotion. The rhymes are very cute and catchy. Our 1 year old squeals with excitement every time she finds it and she will sit and flip through the pages over and over and over. We love it!
__label__1 Bewildered that many enjoyed this: I don't see how this movie recieved so much praise other than for the fact that many people must've been blinded by their faith to the point that they would support anything pertaining to their god without viewing it first and foremost as art without a completely biased eye. This movie told no story and made no attempt to, it was simply an hours worth of beating the likes of which would've killed Jesus long before he made it to the cross. It seems as if this film was made for the sole purpose of evoking pity and guilt, rather than educating.
__label__1 I liked her Lords of the Underworld Series Better: This is a prequel to Jewel of Atlantis, although I think this book came after Jewel...regardless, Heart of the Dragon is the first I read. I was very impressed with the Lords of the Underworld series by the same author. Lords deals with mythology, and those characters have a depth, and the writing has many unique layers, with a hefty amount of romance...I figured this series might compare.It didn't for me...sort of fluff? Can I say that. Not sure how to put it into words, the book wasn't terrible, but certainly nothing unique. I will not continue with the rest of this series, but do look forward to her next installment of LOU in May 09.
__label__2 This story kept my interest til the last page: So many angles to view this story from. As I was reading, I just KNEW who really killed Vincie's father/the hard working farmer. And then I started realizing it wasn't that person but I was then thinking: PLEASE DON'T BE THIS PERSON! And the anguish that pour Vincie was going though wondering why and who could have done this. The descriptive writing about the Vermont area with the die-hard working families and how stern our ancestors were. It's easy to see my predescessors in these hardworking, serious people. I loved this book and recommend it to all.
__label__1 Meh: This show is not really interesting to me. There is nothing that stands out among the rest of the multitude do crime dramas.
__label__1 Kept me awake!: This didn't work for me--just the opposite, in fact. Whenever I managed to doze off, the annoying vocals on this CD jarred me awake again. Thumbs down.I returned the CD months ago and still haven't received a refund (from the company, not Amazon). They did not respond to email or return my calls. NOT HAPPY! Caveat Emptor. :-(
__label__2 Been taking this for three months, and just got new liver tests. I am in the normal range again.: My topic says it all. My ALT was 58 and is now 45. It's within normal range. I attribute this to the fact I have been taking these supplements for three months now and will continue.
__label__2 Fantastic CD: There's a part of me that, whenever I hear Knopfler's guitar, longs for the instrument to become what it wants be in his hands, a lead guitar. Mark's been beating it into me that he's no longer interested in the pyrotechnics, and it took this CD for me to come to terms with that. He finds inspiration from virtually anything, from Roadrunner to mulligan stew, and crafts stories that place us, for a few moments, somewhere far away, but somewhere real. The music exists more than to provide atmosphere for the story, but to hold it aloft in caring hands. This is a truly beautiful album that rewards the listener in greater measure with each listen. Turn it up loud; it won't hurt your ears.
__label__2 Out There: I can't speak to the genius of any artist. Music -- like literature, a painting or a sculpture -- either speaks to the listener or it doesn't. I've been listening to jazz most of my adult life and understand that its very improvisatory nature, especially in live performances, often results in hits or misses when it comes to exploration of a theme. I've heard eight or ten different live versions of some of Monk's classic tunes -- Blue Monk, `Round Midnight, Misterioso, Straight, No Chaser -- each rendition different. Some were hit out of the ballpark, while others left men on base. I've seen Brubeck perform three times and he almost never failed to hit for extra bases.When it comes to musicians like Monk and Coltrane, a listener either gets them or they don't. I received this boxed set as a Christmas gift, and while the uninitiated might care more for the Master Takes single disc version, I very much enjoyed this complete recordings.Recommended, but perhaps an acquired taste.
__label__2 How Come Hollywood Always Portrays Prisoners as "Beautiful Losers?": This movie was made in 1962 and it appears that Hollywood was determined even back then to portray convicts in a favourable and somewhat romanticized light. This trend has continued in movies such as "Escape From Alcatraz", The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption to name just a few. It does seem kind of perverse to me that a guy locked up in a cage decides to lock up canaries in a cage!This guy is such a loser that even his mother wants the auhorities o keep him in prison and since when are convicts allowed to keep 100% Proof Alcohol in their cells? I do think the makers of turkeys such as this should pay a visit to any Maximum Security Prison where they will finally discover that the inmates are all lowlifes who would readily sell their mothers for some crack cocaine or a hit of heroin. I give this movie 5 stars because I think that Telly Sevalis was the real star of this movie.
__label__1 WORST TEXTBOOK EVER: This book doesn't clearly label its definitions, it also likes to throw definitions randomly in the exercises section. It will often reference solutions from previous sections, making you flip back and fourth between your book while you're trying to read an example. It has mistakes such as on Page 408, the book says "For this purpose, we use the results of Exercise 21(a) of Section 6.2 to. . . . " however if you look at the exercises for section 6.2, problem 21 does not have a part a. The best part is that Page 408 references exercise 21 section 6.2, exercise 21 references the basis obtained in example 5 back on page 345. This is the most frustrating textbook I have ever owned and I truly hate Friedberg, Insel, and Spence for creating something that has caused my past semester to be truly terrible.
__label__1 Have had two pairs and both died: We bought the first set about 18 months ago. Sound quality was very good but the older black cord was junk. It started coming apart after 3 months and now the iPod pauses constantly thinking the cord has been pulled from it. We bought the second set about 15 months ago and even though I thought the newer white/black cord was a better structural design, they are now unusable. As stated in another review, you physically have to hold the connector into the iPod for it to work. So much for that and so much for thinking Bose has a durable product with this. Sound quality good in both cord models, durability poor.
__label__1 well...: This game is pretty much like Picto Chat,but it has color,music,you can customize your character and you can put a background.Dont use your money on this.Keep them until Dynasty Warriors comes out to sale or Need for Speed.The game are cool.Also Gundam is coming out.
__label__2 Stunning follow up to Season 1: Love this series, and nearly everything about it. A great contemporary take on a classic series. Moffat is still a genius. The only thing I didn't like about it is that they haven't continued the series with a "Return of Sherlock Holmes" style comeback (yet).
__label__1 stinking rotting heap of dead worms: Today I received a package containing a fabric bag of dried dirt and what appeared to be a stinking heap of dead rotting worms. I'm thinking the packaging needs improvement.
__label__2 WCW/NWO The Best of Halloween Havoc review: The best matches on the tape were The US tag team title match between The Nasty Boys(Brain Knobbs & Jerry Sags) & The Steiner Brother(Rick & Scott)from 1990,The World title match between Hulk Hogan & The Giant(Paul Wright)from 1995,The steel cage tag team brawl between the team of Sting & Ric Flair against the team of Terry Funk & The Great Muta(1989) and the world title match between Sting & Sid Vicious(1990). The worst matches were the "Monster truck" match between Hogan & Giant(1995) and the Chamber of Horrors match between Team Sting & Team Cactus Jack(1991). The rest were ok. The only match should have been on the tape was the Eddie Guerrero-Rey Misterio-mask vs Crusierweight title match which was a high-flying,hard-hitting showstealer. I give this tape a 6 out of 10.
__label__1 A flimsy piece of junk: This is a TOY, and not as advertised.The trimmer line snaps at the least (weed) or tough grass.Would really like my money back, but do not want to bear the expense of return shipping.I probably will not purchase from this site again.
__label__1 doesn't fit well: I ordered a large and it fit more like a medium. The material wasn't very comfortable either. I would not order the shirt again.
__label__2 Great deal: It is a great deal and good decoration for my office i recomed it i do not have anything else to say
__label__2 Comfortable Sofa Bed: I bought this sofa bed because I want to have additional sleeping space for my guests. I was hesitant to buy the sofa bed online because I can't determine how comfortable it is, but the price is just unbeatable. The sofa bed turned out to be very comfortable to sit on or sleep on. I think the price also offers value because of its quality and workmanship. I recommend people to buy this sofa bed if you are looking for sofa bed that has value and is comfortable.
__label__2 EZ adapter and EZ fix: This little adapter performs perfectly. I use it to connect the S-video out port on my XP laptop to the composite video input on our TV. The picture is clear and the adapter is the essence of simplicity and functionality. I thought it would take much more money than 5 dollars to enjoy the internet on our 1987 TV set. What a wonderful surprise and an easy fix!
__label__2 An excellent intro to Web genealogical resources: The best review I can give of this book is that it directed me to about 6 Web sites I hadn't heard of which should give me a lot of useful information in researching my family tree. Unlike a lot of Dummies books, this one isn't padded with filler; every page conveys useful information, discussing numerous internet resources and making suggestions for organizing research. The book also contains lengthy sections on African-American, Native American, and Hispanic genealogical Web sites, and apparently has more information on these sites than many other books.The reasons I didn't rate the book five stars are two-fold: there are dead links in addition to the live ones, and the book was published before the LDS database (maintained by the Mormon Church) was made available online. That suggests that this book is ripe for a 3rd Edition.
__label__2 A Childhood Favorite: I love this movie it is my third favorite animated movie behind shrek and the first Ice age. This the most romantic movie I have ever scene. I am 14 now and I still love this masterpiece
__label__2 The original stuff!: If you're into the "new" swing explosion (and I do like the new Setzer; also check out HiBall Lounge Sessions and the new Love Dogs), you'll love this. No slow dances; it rocks! And it's the real stuff, the stuff that started it all. Boogie to this, babies, and check out where swing was born!
__label__2 Mirrors help.: We bought these to put on our 97 Dodge Ram for towing our fifth wheel,,, they are a decent mirror for the money, we did add a little bit of foam inside the cavity to help the mirrors stabilize, but for the money it's a very good purchase.
__label__2 lovely book.: my husband enjoys reading these books. so do I.He enjoys books about the old West and the settlementthat occurred during the 1800's.
__label__1 Leaves much to be desired.......: Producers please take note: wildly moving cinematography can be used to show movement or a first person perspective, but when used throughout the entire movie in nearly every scene, it merely comes across as amateurish. Honestly, the cinematography in this film is something I would expect from a group of high-school kids putting together their first film for a class. The fact that somebody actually thought this would be a good idea for a major motion picture is beyond comprehension to me. Watch this movie and try NOT to get a headache. I turned it off before it was over, though I did sit (suffer) through 90% of it. It must also be averred that this is an easy movie to turn off....the story is simply not a compelling one at all.
__label__2 Everyone Has Time for UNO: My family has been playing UNO for years. The thing about UNO is that you can play for a short time if your time is limited or play for long periods of time. The game is quick and stays lively so nobody becomes bored. My grandson and I have played for short periods of time but we have also played for hours and a couple of times we just kept the game out and played at times over a couple of days; this is marathon UNO at its best!!!
__label__1 Drying - maybe the lemon?: Noticed a drying result from using the conditioner and shampoo, I am guessing it is the lemon. I have discontinued using this.
__label__1 bad organization with some typo erros.: I have read part of the book and tried to use it as a reference, but always confused with the bad organization, not to mention some typo errors.personally, I don't recommend it.
__label__1 I want my money back: I have always heard how good the Dave Matthews Band was and I even bought two of their previous albums that I thought were fair. We'll the other day I bought "Busted" because everyone was raving about it doing so well on the charts and how good it was. I hate to give any cd a one star rating but this one is no good. The band sounds like they belong on the David Letterman Show too much saxaphones & horns for me..and they don't play anything catchy or appealing. Dave Matthews has a good voice but other than that this cd only had one half way decent song the rest was no good. I'm going to continue to listen to it though...hopefully one day it'll grow on me but I doubt it.
__label__2 Weber Makes a Great Smoker: Received product quickly. Bottom section was out of round, but was replaced by customer service with a simple phone call. Have not made a bad meal on this smoker and would definately recommend to any new or experienced smoker. Love the web site devoted to this smoker. Great recipes and cooking advise.
__label__1 Just not silvery enough: Not sure why I wasn't convinced by the other reviews. I wanted mirrored lenses, as stated in the product description. I'm talking Nevada highway patrol, do-you-have-any-idea-how-fast-you-were-going levels of silver on the lenses. These are nowhere close -- you can see right through. At least they were cheap.
__label__1 Not very stable: This stand is very handy for keeping crossword puzzles and magazines, but when you use it for getting a strip of toilet paper, it is likely to tip forward a little bit.
__label__2 These are the best toys!: I buy these toys for my 3 dogs every year because, they last just about 1 year! They love them!
__label__2 TOO MUCH!!: THIS ALBUM IS ONE THE BEST ALBUMS I HAVE BROUGHT IN A LONG TIME. YOU CAN REALLY TELL THAT DORINDA IS BLESSED WITH A POWERFUL VOICE AND SHE LET'S YOU KNOW JUST HOW GOOD GOD IS IN THIS AWESOME DISPLAY OF PRAISE AND WORSHIP TO THE LORD. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO LOVES THE LORD AND IS PREPARED TO HAVE CHURCH AND TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THIS IS SPECTACULAR.....IT WILL LEAVE YOU SPEECHLESS...AND EVEN MORE IT WILL DEFINITELY LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOBODY LIKE JESUS!!
__label__1 A big disappointment . . .: I purchased this baby carrier for my 1-month-old son. When I put him in it, he looked so uncomfortable. I tried putting a blanket in there underneath him to prop him up a bit, but it still covered his face. So, I decided to shell out the $[...] for the infant support pillow, expecting that to make a difference. It didn't. He still looked uncomfortable and squished, only now I wasted MORE money. My son is 21 1/2 inces and 11 lbs 4 oz. I can't imagine how a bigger baby could fit in this at all. A big disappointment. If you're looking for a carrier, try the Bjorn. A million times better than this.
__label__1 Another of Prima's hack-'n'-slash jobs...: ...hits the streets with a resounding "thud." It's amazing to me how Prima can keep pumping out this garbage. I guess the only thing more amazing than the low quality of Prima's "strategy guides" is the fact that we keep buying their cruddy books.
__label__2 teach an old dog to stitch!: i really thought that despite the beautiful cover and the name Maggie Grey, as she is quite the name when fabric is around, this book would be eye candy but not inspiring for me to "work on".oh boy was i wrong! Ms. Grey's techniques for changing paper to metal and metal to stitch is quite fun! i thoroughly enjoyed just savoring every page the first time around and then i started actually playing. this is a terrific book for inspiration, teaching, learning, doing, and of course, her handiwork is quite the eye candy. i will have this book on my shelves for many years to come.
__label__1 Money waisted on headphones!: These are terrible- made cheaply. Had only 1 month and they broke. When I asked about the lifetime warranty- they wanted me to send the broken headphones to them which would cost $6.00- 7.00 in postage and them also send them an additional $6.00 so they could ship one back to me.(so instead of paying $19.00 for the headphones - they are really costing: $19.00 + $7.00+$6.00= $32.00- and who's to say they won't brake again.)I spent $19.00 for 1 months worth of headphones, that's terrible!Don't waist your money!
__label__1 prometheus: It was just lame!!!It is so bad i don't even remember all the reasons for this stupid film of mind numbing goofy crap.And i am being kind by giving it 2 stars...
__label__1 NOT built to last: When I first installed this burner, it worked great, but after about 10 months, it has deteriorated in quality to the point where it is almost dead. It burns coasters about 75% of the time, and when it does work, it usually burns at about 12x max. Of course the warranty ended right when the problems started occurring, and tech support was absolutely awful. Stay away from this unit unless you don't mind buying a new one every year.
__label__1 Very Basic.: This is a very basic book on investing, only good for the newbie investor. Of course it's title, and it's positive outlook on actually making money on Canadian Stocks is maybe just what a Canadian needs to help them make some money on Canadian stocks!
__label__2 It works.: It is one of the few products that actually works as advertised. I only wish they made a super glue. It does what it's suppose to do, and then some. Great product.
__label__1 It won't play an entire CD without failing: I listen to music every day in my office so I thought that having an mp3/cd player would be ideal. The product worked great for about a month. Then it started having problems where it would be in the middle of a song and it would just shut off, but it didn't happen that often. I've had it for two months now and I can't get it to play an entire CD without shutting it's self down. Usually it just plays a song or two before it stops working. I wanted to return it when it first started having problems but like I said it worked great for a month. This is the worst product I have ever purchased.
__label__2 I love the exercises: I rented the movie because almost $30 for a 20 minute dvd seems way too much for me. Having said that, I love the exercises and how she explains them all through the 20 minute segement.
__label__2 For Die Hard Rick Springfield fans only!!: Sure the acting is pretty horrible and the plot is pretty stupid,but if you love Rick Springfield you can not miss here. Music is very very good and we get some much needed rear-end views of Rick. They could have come up with better story and supporting actors but you win some and you lose some. Poor Janet Ebert( the prissy phys. here) I do not think she has done anything but a bit extra part in the movie Might Joe Young since this movie. If you are a fan and have not seen this movie yet do not wait. Rent or buy it now. Or wait and check tv listings it is usually on USA's up all night.
__label__2 Great book, but...: I love this book. I love any book that enables me to teach my child anything about safety. This book allows my daughter to see the keypad and dial the numbers just like on a real phone. It has a very simple "story" and is easy for her to understand. My ONLY complaint is that it's not as real-life as I would like it to be. On a REAL 911 call, the operator generally answers and says "911-What is your emergency" or something to that effect. It seems silly to me that the sound effects in this book say "911-Let's go!!!" and then blares sirens and fire truck horns. I just think that it should be closer to a real life situation since 911 is a serious phone call. Other than that one tiny thing, I think this is a great book to assist kids in the importance of dialing 911 and learning that it's just for emergencies and not for playing!!
__label__2 Secret Societies, Murder and Magical Suspense: I have bought and read comic issues #0 thru #11 and I am hooked! This is a great comic series with impressive art (in a 30's noir style) ala Casablanca. It is set in an alternate historical Earth in which the American Civil War ended in a stalemate and in which Europe continues to dominate world and colonial affairs. Amidst this engrossing melieu enters a doctor who begins to uncover the mystery of the San' greal or the Holy Grail. For those who have enjoyed "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and "Da Vinci Code" this will be a worthy addition to grail lore. It draws heavily on the historical Crusades, the Knights Templar and the Catholic Inquisition. It is fast paced and well drawn and colored and I promise you that you'll enjoy every turn of the page.
__label__1 Don't buy this if you have XP: I bought the unit to use with my Win XP platform and could not get the software to recognized the unit. There were no Website updates to download, no tips on using the unit with XP and documentation was terribly lacking in troubleshooting the unit.I reinstalled a virgin copy of XP with no luck as well as a Win98 with USB support and had the same problem.Emailing manufacturer resulted in no reply after 10 days and calling them kept me on the phone for 45 min on my dime. I was forced to return the unit before the the return warranty period expired.I suggest this unit not be used if you use XP and need manufacturer support.
__label__2 can't truss it: let's just forget about all the fun that is flavor of love. forget about the roast of flavor flav. this is the real deal. chuck d has a sound all his own that no one else can touch. i rolled up to a local place with this on and people asked who the new artist was, all i could do was shake my head and break the news to them. this is what rap should be and needs to be again. you can play this over and over it doesnt lose it's appeal. so if 911 IS a joke in your town and you just can't truss it, quit tryin to find your old cassettes and buy this boooooyyyyyeeeeeee.
__label__1 horrible monitor: This monitor is soooo loud. The static is just awful. Don't even bother buying it. You will end up taking it back.
__label__1 Light committed suicide: I got myself a pretty new bike, so I wanted a pretty new headlight. This fit my fancy. However, after a short time of riding the light popped off its mount. I thought I might have put it on incorrectly, so I carefully returned the light to its mount. However, on my usual commute the light came flying off and fell to the ground in many pieces. I haven't gotten more than about 50 miles on this bike with the light in place. Since a light that won't stay on the handlebars is worthless, I'm giving this product the lowest rating. Now I need to shop for a new light, or maybe just put back the old 2-C battery light from my old bike that stayed in place for thousands of miles.
__label__2 Execellent TV: We just purchased this TV and love the crystal clarity and screen size options. We have cable and get 6 HDTV channels that are fantastic on our new tv. Also, we watch many DVD's in Wide screen format that appear crystal clear! We love our new TV!!
__label__1 HORRIBLE SERVICE: Never received the product because the website screwed up and kept my old billing address even after I attempted to change it three times. I contacted the seller through Amazon's link, never got a response, and then had to contact their service department. They said I'd get a refund then changed their minds and said I never contacted them with the correct address even though I did through Amazon. So they ripped me off out of $58 and I never got the product and now they refuse to respond to my attempts to resolve it. HORRIBLE SERVICE--I WILL NEVER EVER EVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN.
__label__2 fantastic: itemed recived super fast and packed well also replaced tensioner (Dayco 89356 Automatic Tensioner Assembly assembly) on 2005 corolla with 106,000 miles this was an easy diy repair! price was dirt cheap
__label__2 This Remington Shaver a fine product: I purchased this shaver to replace a Braun cordless/cord shaver my husband had for about 10 years. I thought I would get him another Braun, but after reading the features and reviews of most of the cordless shavers Amazon offered, this Remington seemed the best choice. I particularly liked that as with the Braun shaver it would replace, it was a cordless/cord model--eliminating any plug-in recharging stand, and also allowing the shaver to be used if ever the recharging feature quit functioning. Also, this shaver happened to be relatively reasonably priced, which was another plus.So far, my husband seems quite pleased with his new shaver. He says that it shaves closely and fits well in his hand. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rather than 5 star rating is that is rather loud. But, if you can live with that, it is likely you will be happy with this shaver.
__label__1 Same o'l same: There is almost no performer or group, for that matter,that I like everything they produce. I truly love Gospel style music but, this one has more than half that just isn't up to what I really enjoy. This is only one person's opinion and I am sure that this may be most appealing to others.
__label__1 mild torture: Well fleshed out characters who do what you think they should do. Since this is his first book, I'm sure subsequent works will be met wtih a keener editor's pen. Includes some interesting trivia, particularly the ball/rat torture trick..yikes.
__label__2 It's Beautiful!: It really is beautiful. We live in an old rambling Victorian house which can be dark and treacherous in the dark, and so I am a night light freak. Daunted a little by the price, I stuck this item in my wish list for future consideration. My son chose it and sent it to me for my birthday, and I have to say it is worth every penny of the price. I may soon order another!
__label__2 Very Convenient and Durable: My other techno friends all use a jumpdrive type device to transfer files to and from work.The reason this gets cheers from me is it's design; Lexar's keychain holder makes this so easy to carry and not forget at home (as my friends complain about), that I wouldn't consider buying another unit without that "sport" capability.
__label__2 Very glad I bought one: I bought one of these maps for my first visit to DC, and it proved to be well worth its price. (The Capitol Hill Hyatt where we stayed had free maps that were okay, but not as detailed and as easy to follow as the Streetwise map.) We walked about 5 miles one day with the map as our guide and not once were we the least bit confused about where we were or how to get to where we wanted to go next. When out alone walking with the map in my back pocket, usually for walks of a mile or more, then too it was the perfect guide, including at night (I carry a tinyFenix LED Flashlight).I grew up in NYC and got spoiled by the relatively easy to follow layout; you got your numbered avenues and streets. I lived in SF where the layout took a bit of getting used to. Washington DC has the most complex layout of any US city I've been in. Thank goodness for the Streetwise map.
__label__1 Not for over the air signals: Pulled amp into over the air antenna and got no better reception on both HD and regular channels. Tried on two different tv's in two different areas of the house. I will try it on Cable signal and revise my comment. I would not waste the money if you are just using this on a regular antenna.
__label__1 Poor quality, broke after 1 year: I bought this dryer because it had so many positive reviews and seemed like a good bargain. Once using it, I was not impressed. It leaves my hair feeling frizzy, not smooth like higher quality dryers. At this point, I still figured it was worth it given the low price. However, almost exactly 1 year after buying it, it stopped working. Perhaps I have unrealistic expectations, but I had hoped it would last longer.
__label__1 Money better spent elsewhere: As a genuine space buff, I read this hoping that the author would be able to find the legacy of the space program and its impact. She didn't. The book reads as a poorly written collection of magazine articles "from the field," complete with obscure references to other literature that we should have read and paradigms that all enlightened individuals should identify with. It seems as though the author had some notes on the UFO phenomenon and some other interesting pop culture fads and strung these notes into a book.It's not that I didn't like her conclusions, but there weren't any conclusions to like or dislike. Or any arguments or revelations, for that matter. The only redeeming feature of the book is her space-related reference list, and that's the only thing keeping it on my shelf.
__label__2 Addictive!: These books are what got me started on a lifelong fascination with the Arthurian legend. I never expected to be so enthralled, but by the time I was done with the first book, I was glad I hadn't picked it up before the other 2 were out - the wait would have been excruciating!
__label__1 did not like them that much: Well I guess thy r ok but the stockings had a run in them after only 1 use and the skin under where the rubbery part is that holds them up was really sore after wearing them so um I'm not going to so I guess the run in them dues not really matter just if u have sensitive skin u may want to not get those.
__label__1 French Fry Maker - Not: I found this piece of equipment to not work as I hoped. I still had to cut the potato in half to fit into the potato chopper. Once in the chopper, it was extremely difficult to push the potato chopper through the slicer. I would not recommend this item and have sent mine back. I was actually quite disappointed because this is the only one I have found after several years of looking.
__label__2 Practical Inspiration: A timeless collection of inspirational essays filled with down to earth advice on creativity, art, writing, and life from a noble soul. I've read and re-read this book many times since it was first given to me many years ago by a special friend and it's always rekindled my artistic fires when I was in deepest need of them. Brenda Ueland uses Vincent Van Gogh, William Blake, Shakespeare, de Musset, Mozart, and other artists as examples of hard work, devotion, and passion. No matter how down and out you may be, wherever you may be in your life, "If You Want to Write" will bring you back to your higher self, reminding you that "you have talent, are original, and have something important to say." Sometimes that's all one needs to hear (or realize all over again) in order to take the next step in their lives.
__label__1 Learn The Correct Dates: I was reading over the back cover of this book and I realized that hey have Kurt listed as dying in 1995 instead of 1994. It may have just been a typo but it still makes me a little uneasy about the book.
__label__2 Inpatient Obstetric Nursing: Great for studying for cert. exam. However I found several questions and answers that were inaccurate. On the whole a good study guide.
__label__2 "Best of Romero": This is my favorite Romero film of them all. The gore is the best in this one, (in my opinion). The zombies also looked a bit more realistic compared to the dawn of the dead and night of the L.D., where their skin was just kinda pale, not saying there were'nt good movies though. This was the movie that got me into zombie films. After watching one of the soldiers throats getting ripped out while screaming (and the fact that you can hear his voice getting higher and higher was a nice touch I might add) was excellent. Like I said one of Romeros greatest Films ever. If you dont like this one, you dont like Romero!
__label__2 Softer sound and easier on the fingers: Ordered these to tone down my practice volume at home, and experiment with a softer sound. If you've been playing with full rounds, these will feel a lot smoother. My fingertips have definitely appreciated it, especially sliding up and down the strings. The output volume seems slightly lower with these.It's also nice that D'Addario color codes the strings on the bottom.
__label__1 Triple Mark-up: I bought these because the nearest Ikea is a long ways away and I don't own a car. I needed some tea lights for a party, and got these out of necessity. I will never do so again.As tea lights go, they are fine. They burn. They produce light. They last a few hours. They do everything a tea light is supposed to be.But, the price is outrageous.All these are is the same candle you get from Ikea. Seriously, the exact same candle. With Ikea printed on the bag. Someone is just driving to Ikea, buying a whole bunch of their tea lights and then re-selling them here. A clever idea, I must admit, and they got me once for it. But never again.It is worth the pain to take a day trip out to Ikea and buy three or four hundred of the exact same tea light for the same price.
__label__2 Great: I bought these for the price. The quality is unbeatable. Very easy to install and durable . I would recommend to others.
__label__2 stanley tools: Stanley tools will always be held in high regard.If you look after this equipment it give good service for years.
__label__1 Yuck, yuck, yuck......................: Some nice color pix..... but nothing else but a boring writer discussing on boring dead women and what does that have to do with Sarah? Absolutely nothing, imho. Sarah writes something in the book; but, even that's kinda boring and so, I wouldn't recommend it, especially since it's authorized and, well, nice. Buy that other book that's much cheaper and much more exciting.
__label__1 Not as good as I hoped....: After looking at the generally positive reviews, I thought that these speakers would be good for me as I'm not demanding on rich bass and hi fidelity. All I wanted was a booster speaker to use at work with my smartphone. I'm a low voltage installer and sometimes have to stand in front of panels and terminate large amounts of wire for hours. All I wanted was a portable speaker that would boost my phone's music player to a more listenable level without chewing through batteries day after day. These are well made with good construction, solid weight, and I love the way the cord stores. They are also the perfect size to slide in with my tools to be convenient. The only problem is that they aren't even as loud as the speaker on my Blackberry! Way too quiet! The sound quality is a little thin, but its fine. I just wish they were louder. After all, aren't you supposed to be able to HEAR speakers?? For me, they were a waste of money and will never be used.
__label__1 Not what I expected: The Poster was not what I had expected, it was rather small. However I would make sure the next time that I read closer and see the actual size before I buy.
__label__2 Great Product: The Girl's Junior Golf Set is a assemlbed with excellent craftmanship and is a Great Starter set. I highly recomend this set.
__label__1 Review of Opers Years of Nelson Eddie: The collection of reviews which forms the main body of the book is useful to have. I thought the short biographical section to be short on hard facts and angledto infer a love affair between Nelson and Jeanette.Margaret Blair
__label__2 Attractive Baroque Concertos: Here are six attractive violin concertos from an obscure baroque composer on a level with, let's say, Geminiani. Facco has an individual flair, and the performances here are top-flight, particularly from Federico Guglielmo and Carlo Lazari who share soloist chores. Anibal Cetrangelo conducts the Albalonga Ensemble stylishly, but contributes long-winded and confusing annotation that I recommend skipping. Can't say this is essential listening, but if you like the genre you'll like the disc.
__label__1 vacumm bags don't fit at all: These vacumm bags are worthless for this vacumm. They do not fit at all for the Hoover Portapowr vacumm. It was a total waste of money. It's just an open bag on the top, there is no collar.
__label__1 Picture is not size you get: The picture that is shown is not the size that you actually receive. The bottle I got was half that size.
__label__1 Quelle Disappointing!: Having read NY Noir I waited for this one with bated breath. I could have unbated by breath, I was mightily disappointed. The photos were average at best, some were even white-outs. I can't imagine why those would even be included. The captions/ descriptions were placed on the page before each set of pictures and I found it very bothersome to have to flip back and forth.If only the subject matter had been a bit more compelling...oh I don't know why, but the book just did not move me. It took me about 15 minutes to read the entire book. If you are really interested in true crime/photography, any book by Weege or New York Noir are two I highly recommend. Save your money on this one and look at it in the library.
__label__2 Clever and charming anti-Western diatribe: A Choice of Gods covers some of the same ground as Crane's atrocious Hero's Walk and the overrated film, "Day the Earth Stood Still;" Simak suggests that humanity, or at least white people, are so monstrous that we would be better off if we were subordinate to invincible aliens. Fortunately for the reader, Simak is a charming writer, and emotionally and philosophically sophisticated (check out his complex and ambigious view of faith and religion in this book), so this novel is a good read, whatever you think of its politics and economics. Worthy of recommendation to any thoughtful SF fan, but especially to environmentalists, socialists, and people who think hunter-gatherer societies were (or should have been) the pinnacle of human development, who will love Simak's relentless attacks on industry, private property, and technology. In my opinion, not as good as Simak's City, but better than Cemetary World, the other Simaks I read in the last year or so.
__label__1 This company is not reputable: I wanted to purchase this item in order to enjoy the last two games of the NFL season in comfort. I need them prior to December 23, 2006. I was promised delivery before December 18th. The item did not show up and on December 20th I contacted the company by telephone and never got a customer rep so I had to leave a message. The company did state via prerecorded message that they were having technical problems with their ordering system but would have it resolved and would contact anyone who had placed an order recently. The company never contacted me and I never received my item. I am very displeased by this purchase as the company does not call you back which means to me that they do not need your business. Find another company with a reputable name and sales history! I will not purchase anything from this company in the future.
__label__1 Sick Puppy: a nauseating read: A miserable read! Thought he was kidding with the enviro-nut spin in the 1st 10 pages, but it kept getting worse. The celebrated characters are criminals, and the romantic interlopers are a pair composed of an unbathed deadbeat living off inheritance (obviously wouldn't understand economics) and a cheating wife (who also had not clue about economics).More nauseating than the most left-wing paraphernalia you can buy in the free world (but maybe you could get worse in Cuba or China; maybe France).I can read a book every 1 - 2 nights, but it's been over a week and I can't finish this piece of rot. Rare that I put a book down without finishing, but I've had pushishment enough already.MISERABLE!
__label__1 It was A'ight: This album was okay, but it wasn't great. There was a lot in it that was simply boring, and this CD went pop. I really don't have a problem with pop music, but bands need to stay true to their roots, and instead of simply growing, Reel Big Fish has complete jumping the genre. Ska may not be the best seller, but they should have stayed with what they did best.
__label__2 A beautifully inspiring book!: As a Thai Massage Practioner I have found "A Thai Herbal" to be an excellent addition to my library & my practice. This book is perfect for people with any level of knowledge in herbology, from basic to advanced. It looks at Traditional Thai Healing systems from the holistic standpoint, discussing not only the Materia Medica of Thai Herbs but also the Thai traditions of use for them. Pierce guides the reader on a journey of using Thai herbs thru diet, massage, herbal compresses and bodycare/household products that ends with the reader feeling they have really been taught from a traditional viewpoint. It also contains a very helpful resource section for those wanting to learn more about these healing plants.
__label__1 Dont waist your money: It sucks it doesnt read some of my Burned CD'S and skips when its supposed to have G-Protection And a Walkman.
__label__2 Excellent Pot: I'm completely happy with this pot. It heats evenly; retains the heat well; the enamel surface is easily cleaned; I've had no scratching or chipping; and with the handle being metal, it is oven safe to a higher temp than Le Crueset. If I bought another, I'd stay with the Lodge.
__label__2 The awesomeness of God: Shekinah Glory is an anointed and God ordained ministry. I'm not from their church, but Ive been so blessed by their cd's and dvd's so much that I've even taken it to the womans prison. I've seen how God has ministered to these woman in the prison through this aswesome ministry. U gotta have shekinah glory praise and worship music.
__label__2 The best yet: I waited all summer for this book and was not disappointed. This is the best "Irene" book yet! More complex, more gripping. Feisty Irene is a GREAT heroine. Now, I can't wait for the next one. Ms. Burk, please hurry! (Amazan.com just needs to get the title right.)
__label__1 Mine turned out to be cheap and unreliable: I bought one of these because it was cheap and came with a big rebate, and now it's driving me crazy. It locks up at least twice a day, forcing me to get out a paper clip and push the reset switch.Other people on the Internet also report problems.NOT recommended.
__label__2 Wide/big head shooters? Look no further!: Not everyday where you can easily find a shooting safety glass that'll fit my size 61 head, according to my Oakley sunglasses.I was actually surprised this Radians Clay Pro not only fits very well, but also it's a very comfortable fit! The metal wire frame is a BIG, and I mean BIG plus if you have a wide/big head. It won't create pressure points when you wear them for an extended period. Also if you use earphone-style hearing protection, this is a plus.However as some stated it's not as clear as some other glasses out there.It does ventilates very well to prevent fogging.Bottom line, if you have a wide / big head where even finding a pair of sunglasses are difficult, this is your shooting safety glass.Besides, at this price you can't complain!
__label__1 Boring!: It sounded like an interesting premise: bookish, plain girl and handsome aristocrat fall in love in Restoration England. Some scenes were amusing, such as any scene with the adorable Jewel involved. But romantic/sexual tension? Non existant. Story line? Other than having her (Violet's)mother throw her together with Ford and her hopes of them winding up together, there was no plot to speak of. Oh, there was a worry on Violet's part that Ford would marry her for her money only and Ford's financial concerns, but it felt as if it were added as an afterthought, as if the author thought the book she was writing was too thin. This book dragged on for pages and I had to force myself to finish reading it (Once I start a book, I finish it!). It, if it were given more sexual tension and a better plot line with more obstacles would have been a better book. I'll be selling mine on Ebay or at a used book store as soon as possible.
__label__2 An amazing collection for any fan: A very nice selection for the first volume of Fred and Ginger movies. The very best interspersed with some of the not very best, so that if they do make a volume 2 with the last five films they made together, we will be sure to buy it as well.
__label__1 Not impressed.: I hate to agree with the reviewer "John Q. Public", but I am forced to here. I wanted very much to like this movie. I remember the books fondly from my teen years, and I have always been a fan of British humor such as Python and Blackadder. That being said, this movie just did not work. I was left feeling flat about the acting, the plot decisions, the special effects, and it just wasn't that funny.The character of Ford seemed incredibly wasted here, and Zaphod was over-the-top in a way that distracted from the story. Trillian was pushed to the foreground in a way that felt forced. Arthur was the character I tried hardest to connect with, and yet just couldn't. He seemed to take all of this a little too in stride, and that pulled me out of the movie.
__label__1 Do not buy this item: Do not buy this product if you do not want to run a new 220 line for your house. It's useless.
__label__2 One of the most amazing movies i have ever seen!!!!: This movie has become on of my all time favorite movies. The story line and the script were magnificent. The movie was not only great but it has a message that came with it. Christian Slater was amazing in this role and realy brought the mane charecter, Mark, alive. I higly recomed this movies. You have to see it!!!!
__label__1 necesidad de aclarar dudas...: Buenos días, gracias por la pronta respuesta.Le escribo con la finalidad de saber en que tiempo me reintegran el dinero y saber cual sera la gestión realizadas por ustedes para la reintegración del dinero. Esto es un encargo que tengo que solventar lo mas pronto posible y necesito la compra del articulo inmediatamente.le agradezco el interés y espero solventar la situación lo mas breve posible..
__label__2 A kid's review: My 9 year old wants to let any compadres know that:Compared to this game other games are like smelly feet. The reason I like it is because you can see where you're going, it rarely goes out of control, and it's fun, fun, fun!!!!!! I think it's beautiful and glorious. If I had a choice between this game and my brother I would choose this game.The reason I like it is because the levels are great, the pictures are good, and there's this one level where you have to do this mirror thing where you connect the mirrors to a crystal ball.So buy this game and if you don't you're just sick.
__label__1 Thi book is bad: When I first picked up this book, I was expecting one of the best books ever written. What I discovered is that it was , in fact, one of the WORST books that I have ever written. My only regret is that I wasted 3 and 8 dollars days on it. I would not read it again for money.
__label__1 Ok, but....: I guess I expected the ethereal sounds of heaven that I wanted - but it was just not quite what I thought....I can't say it was bad, just not the deeply moving lovely sounds that I've heard from other albums...
__label__1 Sub titles suck: Was looking forward to seeing this movie from decades past. Was not happy that I had to sit and watch BRIGHT YELLOW subtitles throughout the movie - very distracting.
__label__2 Elvis in Charro....AWESOME: A Different Kind of Role, A Different Kind of Man sums it all up. This by far was Elvis' best movie. Elvis himself loved this movie more then any he had done. He even liked this better then King Creole. I spoke with James Sikking (Gunner in the movie)and he told me that at the cast party Elvis told him that this movie had been his best so far. Elvis Presley in a beard and not breaking out into a song or dance...he must have loved it. Check out the movie and tell them Jess Wade sent ya :)
__label__1 Nice look, nice problems.: This phone is good. But what's the point of having a phone where the #1 button stops working. The first phone I sent it back for an exchange and guess what happens? The new phone's #1 button just messed up again. It hasn't even been 2 months. Sony needs to fix this problem.
__label__1 I second the "publicist" review: I also received an email from a "fake" library patron asking if we would consider buying this book for the library. I read the review and thought the book did sound interesting, however it will not be on our shelves due to the underhandedness of those trying to sell the book. I certainly hope you turn to a more honorable marketing strategy before you lose more prospective customers.
__label__2 A positive look at female role models and relationships: The essays and pictures of Girlfriends create a much-needed window into the state of modern relationships, female role models, and the warmth that friendship can create between people. I especially appreciated the more unusual friendships that were profiled between anglers. owners of floating cars, and firefighters. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone looking for a book/gift to warm the heart of a loved one, or a book to remind yourself of the things that really make life and relationships worthwhile.
__label__1 utterly disappointing: unless u would want to see the world from the eyes of ordinary 16 year old, it is a complete waste of time n money ... there's no depth in it and as u move on to chapters the story wears off disappointingly, n u would feel like reading a diary of some teenager ... u get nothing out of it really - to be honest i didnt even finish the book.
__label__2 Ipod Remote: After reading the reviews I decided to purchase the remote. Pros: keeps my eye on the road, works great, immediate response by Ipod!Cons: It slips a little on the sterring wheel, don't like the feeling of the velcro on the outside of the wheel when making turns (it feels like a large spot of sandpaper as I let the wheel slide through my fingers)Other than that it's a GREAT ProductI would recommend it to others!
__label__2 Excellent telling of an excellent story: I had no idea that a book on the building of the Panama Canal could be so fascinating, mostly because I had no idea that the story itself was so fascinating. David McCullough's 1977 telling of that story, in The Path Between the Seas, is excellent. From the debate over the path and the method, to the somewhat disastrous French attempt, through the triumph of the United States' completion of the canal, this 600 page history moves fast. The technological (sea level or locks?), natural (the landslides and the annual flooding of the Chagres River), and health (malaria and yellow fever) obstacles were enormous. The scale of the project was, literally, unprecedented. This book is just as much biography (de Lesseps, Bunau-Varilla, Roosevelt, Gorgas, Goethels) and political history as it is a description of just how the canal was built.
__label__1 A BANAL COLLECTION OF POP MUSIC: Except for one or two songs (those being the title track and "Wrong Night") the rest of this album holds appeal only for those who like pop music. There's nothing wrong with that but I don't like it classified as country because that is NOT what it is. This effort is of little distinction and my least favorite Reba album. Most of the songs here are banal pop songs.
__label__1 This weight loss cure is not for the average guy!: The only way a person could follow this detailed diet is to check into one of the clinics mentioned. This is not for the average person.
__label__1 Fun for a while: We liked the spoon until the moisture affected the batteries, causing it to malfunction.
__label__1 comentario biblico conciso: NO, no, no!!! muy mal producto!!!, lo unico bueno que tiene son las parted de la Biblia de alla en fuera solo la paraphrase it. Sus comentarios son fuera de realidad y no tienen funda,mento teologico, igual afirma cosas que sit u lees la Biblia la contradicen, todo!, y lo que Dios dijo.No, no, no, no!!! bad product!!!, the only good thing it has are part of the Bible other than that all it does it's to paraphrase it, the comments it gives are way far from reality and have no theological foundation and affirms things that if you read the Bible will see that the comments contradict the Bible, all of it and what God said.
__label__1 Worst remote ever used: Bought this remote online at amazon.com and received it within 2 days but the actual remote only lasted 3 weeks before it totally stopped working completely. I thought it was the batteries although new batteries were installed but that wasn't the problem. For the few short weeks that it worked it actually did work on all my devices. I wouldn't recommend this remote to anyone. I had to eventually come back to amazon to get a one-for-all, the one I had originally intended to get.
__label__1 Looks can deceive you!!: I bought this phone falling for its cool design.But this phone is not functional. The battery life is awful. It just fails without adequate warning.Also the phone menu design is also not good compared to panasonic phones. I think the Engineers who designed this phone need to do better.I can forgive the menu design. But I cannot forgive the battery life issues. This makes this phone a failure.I have a much older panasonic which gives me much better battery life.I have decided to stick only with panasonics in the future and will not recommend vtech phones to anyone.
__label__2 Utterly charming and delightful!: Magnificent! If I could have given it more than 5 stars, I would have. A beautiful, tender, romantic keeper. You'll love James from the very first chapter. He is what every wife hopes her husband will be as a father. He IS the perfect father. Elizabeth is a lovely character as well but it is James' story more than hers. The storyline is so original and different and the Treasures are a true delight (Except that Ruby needed a good spanking!) I can't say enough good things about this book. I read it in a day and a half but it will remain in my memory for a VERY long time.
__label__2 Good message for kids: I like this film, because it has a good message, simple and short. And even has Bible verses. I Recommended for your kids.
__label__1 Don't buy these controllers: Purchased 2 controllers, after first use one of the two had broken. Contacted the seller and they allowed us to return it for exchange of a new one. Meanwhile second controller broke, got the replacement back and it broke after the first use.They are just junk. You get what you pay for.
__label__2 Cool design, soft material, and versatile...GREAT!: I bought this as a gift for someone in May 2010 and they enjoy it. It's very versatile and easy to slip on when you want to feel comfortable. The person I gave it to uses it after coming home from an 8-5 desk job and changes into this as they escape their stifling work clothes. They handwash as recommended and the color has lasted to this day (Feb 2011). Great purchase, and gift recipient is enjoying it!
__label__2 Command & Conquer: If you like Command & Conquer then you'll love this futuristic version of it, except that Starcraft is a lot more in depth. Exceptional graphics, audio, and gameplay. This game is totally on the other side of the house with the likes of Q3A and Unreal Tournament. Not really fast paced as UT but more thinking is definitely involved. This game is pure stategic warfare! If you don't like chess and don't know what C&C is, then you're looking in the wrong game category.
__label__1 Good for a novice: Cawley provides good information for a novice, such as, steps of recruiting, illegal questions, available websites, sample letters, etc. However, if you have several years of recruiting under your belt, this book will not provide any new information. I found several typos throughout the book. [I didn't mean to ding the author, through Amazon, I did not have the ability to read the back cover. And I did not notice where in the description it said it was for a novice. If I did, I would not have purchased the book. Wow, I've never thought to contact the author when I find typos.]
__label__2 3 and 3/4 ***: 1. The book is worth a read and for those that enjoy mysteries or urban fantasy its worth buying.2. I live in St. Louis3. I am not pagan, although I have friends that are.Never Burn a Witch was an enjoyable wasting of time that I should have been doing other things. Although not quite as good as Harm None, I found it to be engaging but be warned you may be somewhat grossed out at the two burning killings. Living in the city I found it to be fun to be able to place MR Sellars scenes and name changed communities ["yes, I recall that snowstorm and lets see, Millchester is here, and Brairwood could be that..."]If I have a complaint its that MR Sellars, due to the demands of fiction, is loading up the city in his books with more a deranged criminal element that our midwest, comfortably apathetic city really is. But then if he didn't he wouldn't have a series.
__label__2 Nice laugh factor: My son received this for his first birthday. At first he wasn't completely into it but after a few days he has "really taken off". My only concern is that it is rather small. My son is in the 60 to 75th percentile of kids his same age and size and I bet within 3 months he won't fit comfortably on it. Oh, and it doesn't have a reverse button. But my husband and I enjoy pulling our son back from some blockade that he has just run into; mostly walls. This is an entertaining gift for all.
__label__1 Makes the most exciting band in the world sound dull: OK, ok, I've heard it a million times...being on the road with a band is only exciting for that one or two hours a night they're playing. BOY, does Green's book drive that point home! But, where a better story teller might have turned an account like this into a character study of some doubtlessly fascinatinating individuals (the band and its hangers-on), Green provides a series of dull anecdotes that don't seem to go anywhere or offer any real insight into the main characters. A big yawn by any standards, and a big disappointment for anyone looking for some insight into the Clash myth and legend.
__label__2 great: Love it, everything I expected I just went down to office depot and made my own laminate for it and there you go.
__label__2 One of the best books of all time!: This book was what started the whole thing. The entire fantasy genre owes its roots to Tolkein. Without him, we wouldn't have silly but brave Hobbits, beautiful and wondrous Elves, stalwart dwarves or daughty and prideful Dunedain. Tolkein was the first (and probably the best) writer to fully create a fantasy world that draws you in with its detail, astounds you with the vividness of its characters, and surprise you with the fulness of its history. If you love fantasy, but haven't read this book, then you are definitely missing a classic. Tolkein is one of a very few fantasy authors whose work can be honestly called "literature".
__label__2 Easy to use: Easy navigation from the table of contents, love the NIV. Much nicer to have it on the ipad than having to carry around my big bible!
__label__1 Full of misinformation: There is no credible anti-vaccine stance. This book is full of misleading statistics and outright lies. All medicines including vaccines have risks, but those risks are much lower than the harm caused by catching the disease. The authors advocate deliberately putting infants, children and immune-compromised adults such as the elderly in harms way. If I could give this book zero stars, then I would.
__label__1 Poor Product: This watch was sold as NEW and appeared to be new except for the box which showed extreme wear. The watch did not keep time and when observed the second hand actually stopped for several seconds at a time. It lost 40 minutes a day. I bought another identical one at WalMart and it acted the same same way! I put a new battery in the one I purchased form Amazon and the jeweler and I watched it continue to act the same way. Don't take a chance on this one!!!!
__label__2 A Retelling of Austen's Mansfield Park: I read this many times over the years, and greatly enjoyed the Dunnes, but since I watched all the BBC Jane Austen novels recently, I realized this is a take on Mansfield Park - the charity girl in love with the boy of the house, who considers her a sister; the immoral brother and sister who deceive the family; the wedding of the oldest daughter disturbed by the play the young people want to put on, etc. But for all that, it is a good read, and stands on its own. The sequel is Listening Valley.
__label__2 Never gets old!: We can't get enough of Pocahontas! We bought it for our Kindle Fire from the Amazon store for car trips or just some mommy quiet time. Its an excellent deal if you're a prime member.
__label__2 Like Being There: This book opens the time capsule on the making of Kind of Blue and jazz in the late fifties. In contrast to Niesenson's recent work on this album, this book provides a great deal of new information. The description of the studio itself, an old church, and the engineers who recorded the album and their methods and equipment was fascinating. The book captures not only the almost supernatural alignment of the jazz moons of three of the most dominant figures in jazz, Miles/Trane/Evans, but it also explains the practical business of producing and promoting jazz albums in this time period. I simply could not put it down.
__label__2 many helpful examples: The mathematical approach is very solid. The authors really try to explain everything and often are successful in this. However the mathematics are difficult to grasp for undergraduate students that do not have a background in mathematics. There are many worked examples in the book. That always helps a lot!I have a few objections:- there are far too many boxed equations, so that students become confused. Unimportant equations, or equations that are just repeated to show that the are not valid anymore should be left out or printed nondescript instead of emphasized- there are many errors in the book. Did nobody see that even the Maxwell equations in Ch. 5 are wrong ??- in the problems, the use of units or the given solutions are often inconsistent
__label__2 I really enjoyed this book: I've read other books by Feather and really was disappointed, not this time. I loved Arabella and Jack. I loved the hint of danger in Jack and Arabella's good sense. She carefully planned her actions and didn't engage in the usual historical romance virginal silliness. No wacky friends or over the top villians. The book could have used more suspense or more tension. Don't skip this one.
__label__2 She loves it!: We wanted something gender neutral, check! We wanted a jumper that was safe, check! We wanted something she would still show interest in a month (or months) later, check! Our little girl looks like a ballerina in her Graco Jumper. She loves it. We love it. Happy customers.
__label__1 Too heavy: This watch was not running at all when I received - the battery was dead. Also, it was far too heavy for me. The crown would not pull out properly.
__label__1 Wrong about paganism in the United States: As a general overview of (neo) pagan beliefs, the book is basically accurate. However, the author clearly has no understanding of American religious beliefs, history, or American culture in general. Conceptually, the book is often astoundingly wrong--see the other Amazon reviews--and the book lacks even the basic facts about paganism or any religion in the United States. The author has not consulted the readily available scholarly work on neopaganism in the United States, and he seems unfamiliar with pagan authors as well.
__label__2 Great, but replacing can be a problem: THis thing is wonderful, except for the fact that nearly all have a defective headphone jack. After about 2 months of continous use, the sound seems "to be played through a tunnel, or tinny." The good thing is that it has a 1 year manufacturer waranty, so you can replace it. I'm waiting for mine, just sent it out yesterday. The interface is incredibly smooth, the firmware updates make it VERY versitile, and it runs like a dream. Overall, i say to buy it, and if u get a defective one, replace it in 2 months. :)
__label__2 Great leadership wisdom: Love him or hate him, Donald Rumsfeld gets results. While this book is based on the famous 'Rumsfeld's Rules' it gives great examples of Rumsfeld's leadership wisdom and credentials from his days as a Congressman, cleaning house in the Ford administration, his days at Searle pharmaceuticals, and today leading the Defense Department. Short informative chapters give great insight into the man the press fears and respects. Highly recommended.
__label__2 But under the ground...: In homage to 1950's giant bug movies Tremors is about giant mutant worms that suck up people under the ground. The greatest thing about this film is the outlandish characters and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously. The movie is definately more of horror movie than the sequels, but there are some very good comedy bits instead of just having a straight up comic relief character. The special effects are genuin, no CG crap, or mat paintings. The acting is funny, Michael Gross is more of an (...) in this movie than a hero like he is in the others, but I still like him better than the two leads. Worth every penny, one of my favorite movies.
__label__2 Must have book for todays leaders: Lincoln on Leadership is the formula of todays leader. This book touches on all the characteristics of what leadership is about. It is a breath of fresh air,as well as very inspiring.
__label__1 Fashion freedon perhaps but only for a few: I am 27 years old and in something of a transition stage with my wardrobe and I thought that this would be the book for me. This book does offer some useful advice. It encourages the readers to determine who they are and what they want to project before shopping and it does give some pointers for looking for quality garments. These are helpful. They do use a number of technical terms and illustrations and/or line drawings would help to illustrate this and would help people to distinguish between terms. My main complaint is that this book mainly seems to be written for people who are either corporate or sartorially clueless or a mixture of both. Being neither of these, it was only moderately helpful.
__label__1 Superficial, biased and glib: This is a vacuous, oversimplified mess. The author glibly makes wisecracks that are either insulting to people from early days or are incomprehensible to someone seeking to learn a few facts of European History. I will also say that I got the book because I have been reading a complete history of the Popes and I wanted to "fit" each Pope into his proper historical period- well guess what? I imagine because this is under the "dummies" title - but the author rarely tells you the YEARS that each of the rulers reigned, with a few exceptions, of course - the result it that the middle ages, as per usual, blends into a goofy, society of creative anachronisms type of stew.Skip this if you want to learn anything about history. I also agree with the other poster regarding the downplaying and negligible discussion of the inquisition - and I am a Roman Catholic. Let's not rewrite history.
__label__2 Barbra collection: Loved this movie for the fantastic wardrobe!!! Really '60's and cute, too. You can't beat Barbra S. for any songs in any of her movies, and of course, the comedy of her love stories!! Enjoy this fun movie!!
__label__1 Poor quality tapes and mediocre storyline: We have enjoyed listening to the Reacher series on unabridged audioboks. This one was on cassette tapes and they sounded like a distant echo chamber with muffled narration. In addition the story line was fluffed out with the meat being less than 40% of the time. I believe we have heard 5 others which were much better than Running Blind and suggest you skip this one, particularly if it is a cassette audiobook.
__label__1 Never Again: I've been using numerous Western Digital drives for the past 2 years and in fact I have 2 of these 1TB drives that I've been using for video editing on a Mac.My main gripes are:The drive seems to spin down in like 30 seconds after not being accessed. Normally this would not be (as much) of a problem for other types of use, but it's absolutely unacceptable for video editing.The cooling fans are super-loud and seem to blow super-hard at odd times (not necessarily when they're working hard).I have to do all kinds of workarounds to get the drive to mount.I cannot chain more than 2 of these drives together and WD tells me I might have an issue with my computer motherboard which is BS.I'm not buying these drives anymore.
__label__1 100 No longer supported by Magellan: My eXplorist 100 is only 4 months old and is defective. It's been treated very carefully but it will randomly clear the screen, lose the satellites and now is clearing all data... very frustrating.When I contacted the company, they say it's no longer supported and they won't repair it or honor the warranty (they are offering some sort of trade up, but I can't find out what the offer is yet as they say the phone system is having 'technical difficulties').So I loved the 100's price and features, but if you buy it, realize that if there is any issue, you are on your own.
__label__2 Excellent product!: I bought this particular vacuum because of the customer ratings. It is really that good. I couldn't be more pleased.
__label__1 Fact Checkers are GOOD: What a load of horse excretement. Do your own research; there are no facts involved with this production. The truth is accessible, be discerning. Knowledge is power.
__label__1 Dark Visions: I should stop with the L.J. Smith books. I never seem to like them. This may be the worst I have read so far. It didn't have a solid character, plot or storyline in it. I was lost most of the time and never really felt the urge to continue reading. I did finish this one however and was simply bored by it. I do not recommend you read this book.
__label__2 Gwyneth Paltrow shines once (or twice) again!: A great film that really shows off Ms. Paltrow's gift for comedy and a British accent. Not many actesses today would be able to pull off playing the same character in two completely different situations at the same time.Chalk this one up as one of Ms. Paltrow's greatest performances.
__label__1 The WORST Video Game My Poor Eyes Have Ever Seen: Do not buy this game. I got it for 4 dollars at my local Gamestop. It's one of the worst games ever created in humankind's history. The game is meant to be played in an arcade, not at home. Horrendous menus, gameplay, graphics, story, everything. Absolutely trash.
__label__1 Glad I'm not a twenty-something anymore: I liked Girl's character and I thought Buster was cute but Girl's workplace and boss(es) were like a bad dream where you realize you've forgotten to study for a final. It made me so happy (and relieved) a. to be 48 yrs old and b. to have majored in Nursing in college where from the first second of my first job and my first patient I knew (in theory anyway) what I had to accomplish at work. Because I am so removed from a corporate life in NYC from a twenty-something (or any!) perspective I was definitely a voyeur-reader. The book made me a little dizzy though and at the end I'm not even sure what I finished.(or why!)Satire or not, the book was essentially shallow and the writing, well, (purposefully?) weak. I'm not sure but I think that was the point and perhaps it backfired on the authors.
__label__2 Another classic from Oscar Levant: This book should be republished. It's Oscar's third and last. A priceless treasure trove of witticisms and rememberences. Impossible to put down.
__label__2 Warm sheets: I previously purchased two sets of these sheets in Dec. one as a present for our adult daughter and one for our vacation condo in the mtns. I then decided that we needed a set on our bed at home. If you do not use an electric blanket these sheets are great in the winter as they are not cold like regular cotton sheets. They are soft and very comfortable. They do pill and release lint when washed. Too early to tell how bad the pilling will be. Stay tuned!
__label__1 Flimsy as can be.: This is an ultra light weight product and a bit flimsy. A good gust of wind will blow it right off the generator. I would rather spend a little more for a better quality product. This is cheese-ola
__label__1 Couldn't agree more - it's a silly, clunky, boring toy: How is this a toy - there's nothing for the child to play with! Just like another reviewer mentioned, my 7 month-old son likes to watch it and pat it in Stage 2 while I am turning the dial or putting the balls in. Also, the stuff that goes into each side arm just pulls right out and gets thrown across the room. We don't really want our son to have a walker, so I guess it's a bust for us.My father-in-law bought the toy - we'll bring it out when he visits and that's about it.
__label__1 Dog didn't like them: My dog likes bully sticks, raw hides, pig ears, treats and bones. She is not picky. But for some reason she did not like these bones. I didn't like them either because they made a mess in the house.
__label__2 There is a fine line between stupid and clever: In 1984, Rob Reiner helped craft this hilarious masterpiece that would become an instant classic with comedy fans and heavy metal headbangers alike. Reiner directs and co-writes with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer (all three of whom also play the main three Spinal Tap members) and we get to see the misadventures on the road and a few live performances of the fictional band on the road. So much could have gone wrong with this mockumentary, but thankfully Reiner and co. hit the satirical aspect dead on, and many bands from the era that this film was made are rightfully spoofed and no matter who you are you will not be able not to laugh. All in all, fans of comedies or fans of heavy metal music with a sense of humor should more than give this a look.
__label__2 Exceptional Example of Gregorian Chant: This is just wonderful. Purchased this as a set with Steindl-Rast's book "The Music of Silence."Haunting in its clarity and consistent pace. My tradition has long appreciated and used Gregorian chant as part of the liturgy.This is so soothing to have in the background. The repitition grows on you, and find myself humming or singing along often. Truly mood music for meditation and worship.
__label__1 The Echoing Green: The book is very interesting because of the subject, but it is over-written, and the writing gets in the way of the material.
__label__2 Pro level information: You can tell a lot of effort went into making this book. JB gives outstanding information, maybe too much, on how fundamentals the way a big leaguer plays. this book will take some work for most youth coaches, but worth it.
__label__1 Worked great but not for long: My B&D D5000 just died. I have had this iron only two years. The alarm sounded and the digital read out was flashing, so I unplugged it. Then I smelled an electrical burn odor, like another reviewer mentioned. Up until now, it was a great iron, but now I need to borrow one to finish my sewing project. (Doesn't it always happen when you are down to crunch time?) It will be difficult for me to buy another B&D iron even though I had previously used a B&D F520 for about twenty years.
__label__1 Missing Part & No Product Support From Harman Kardon :(: The SoundSticks II arrived. Amazon packaging did an excellent job, the product box was in excellent, unopened condition. I unpack the speakers and made all the connections only to discover that the power cord to connect the AC adapter to the outlet was not included! I called Harman Kardon customer support only to be told that the power cord is out of stock! The agent told me I would have to go and buy a power cord. I asked to speak to the agent's supervisor and was told the same thing: "the power cord is out of stock, we have none to ship to you. Perhaps there is one in your home you could use?"No quality control. No customer support.
__label__2 AMAZING- MUST HAVE: This is the best bathtub I have used, my baby has been safe and secure from the beginning and it fits perfectly in the kitchen sink :) I also have used it in bathtub to take a bath with him. I put a towel down on it to make it nicer for my son to lay on. JUST GET IT ;) Its perfect.
__label__2 Efficient and easy to clean: This replaced a previous version by the same manufacturer and is more expensive, similar in function, with improved storage system.Works very well for slicing, julienning. Alleged cubing function was incomprehensible to figure out.Included hand protector essential, even if one is not as accident-prone in the kitchen as I am.
__label__1 Trite conspiracy theory: This book is complete nonsense. A substandard author, Robbins relies on sensationalism and rumors to fool the reader into believing that she actually knows what she is talking about.It's fun to read in the sense that it's completely outrageous in its allegations.The Skull and Bones is just another fraternity. All frat brothers help each other out in the business and political worlds. My frat helped me get into law school. And they all have stupid little ornaments. Hell, even my frat claimed to have the skullof Clarence Darrow. It's absurd to think that they had anything to do with the atomic bomb being dropped on Hiroshima, or the founding of the CIA, or the Kennedy assasination. She offers no proof whatsoever, just information from "sources" that happen to coincide with the events. Do not neglect all the other facts about these events.
__label__2 Fur Buster: The day I recieved the FURminator I first brushed my GSD with hisregular brush and then used the FURminator. I got a nice pile of hairwith his regular, but when I used the furminator I got a pile of hairalmost as big as he was. It really decreases the shedding around thehouse. Really love it.
__label__2 Dana Stabenow: I've read at least 6-7 of her books recently and liked each one. Very informative and entertaining for lite and fun reading
__label__1 Doenst work: dont waste your time or money this product doesnt work. tried it with two breeds of dogs. still eating poo
__label__1 Dice is no longer funny: His act was funny 10 years ago. It is time to leave comedy, Dice, because comedy has obviously left you.
__label__2 microflex review: The product pictured is what I wanted but instead I got an improved model of the product. Other than that, the shaver came in on time.
__label__1 Caused severe gas: I gave this product a try to aid in digestion and my Crohn's. I tried different doses from high to low but it kept yielding the same results... severe abdominal gas! I experimented with the product for 2 weeks and my body was unable to acclimate to it. I have tried other Garden of Life products with great results but this one, IMHO, is not worth it.
__label__1 I Don't Believe Ann Rule Wrote This Book: Usually, I can't put down a book by Ann Rule. This time it took me forever to finish, waiting for SOMETHING interesting about the case. The style of writing is not that of Ms. Rule, and I'm a true fan. I thought that she is trying to give a up-and-coming writer a chance at one of her crime tales. It didn't work! It was one the the most boring book I have EVER read. The author seemed to only want to fill pages, rather than tell an interesting story.
__label__2 Schaum's Structural: Schaum's is the greatest educational series, ever. Exactly what I expected from Schaum's regarding structural calculations.
__label__2 Fulcrum Multi Flex LED Book Light: This reading light was just what I was looking for. I didn't think it was too heavy at all. Maybe because I always read hard cover books. I also use it for the bedtime books I read my girls. It's perfect for even the biggest picture books. Keep in mind though. If you're reading a book with high gloss pages that will reflect light it'll be bright enough to wake up your spouse. My only suggestion would be to have a dimmer setting.
__label__2 Absolutely delightful - for all ages: Baum has combined magic, suspense, adventure and pure delight into this wonderful odyssey. It's as fun to read today as it was over forty years ago.
__label__1 Disappointing: "If only a 0 star rating were possible, this movie along with There's Something about Mary would be the recipients. I enjoy slapstick, but this movie is just insidiously stupid."Those were the comments I made nearly 3 years ago. I have come around on There's Something about Mary, but I don't think I would with this one.
__label__2 WD Caviar Blue 640 GB Hard drive OEM/BULK: Item came nicely packaged, not flopping around in the box like some reviews I've read..Been using it for a couple weeks now without issue..
__label__1 A Big Disappointment: Having read Kurowski's "Infanterie Aces" and "Panzer Aces", I was expecting this book to be action-packed and filled with first-hand personal accounts of fighting from the German side. I was severely disappointed as this is not the Kurowski I know. It was overall not a readable book even for the lack of battle action. I would not recommend this book to anyone. But I do highly recommend Kurowski's other books that I have mentioned.
__label__2 Great Afternoon Read: The Marrying Kind, by Cynthia Rutledge, is a great read for anyone who enjoys inspirational romances. If you enjoy reading romances, but don't want to read a novel filled with foul language or explicit sex than this book is perfect for you. Readers watch Taylor Rollins, a young women struggling to maintain her father's reputation after his death, as she falls in love with her handsome employer Nick Lanagan whose last desire is to get married. The book is funny , heartwarming, and sprinkled with inspirational truths that remind you that honesty is always the best policy, and that relationships with God and Family are more important than business.
__label__2 Absolutely transcendental: I stumbled upon this recording gem as college student needing to find a recording of the Ciaccona for a class paper. There are no other words to describe this interpretation other than utterly and completely beautiful. Over the years, I have studied other recordings of these masterpieces by other violinists, but - as many have testified before - this is the one recording I have always returned to. A true expression of a musical offering from a composer deeply devoted to God exacted to perfection by an artist who realizes this devotion.
__label__2 Somewhat Frustrating: I do love Lynn Kurland's books, and I was excited to get this one. However, I have spent some time being frustrated because the hero and the heroine take entirely too long to smooth things out. I like Robin, as heros go, but geez, he spent too much time hurting Anne. Of course, when they finally do patch it up and get together, it relieves the frustration, but I hope Ms. Kurland doesn't allow any more characters to spend this much time getting together.
__label__1 Problems-Bugs. Hangs System, Use another product.: I've always used Norton Internet Security, and while it has had it's problems, I've accepted it as a useable solution. Most of the problems I had could be improved by turning off their firewall and using the Windows XP firewall.I installed Norton Internet Security and it bogged the system down to a near stop. I was unable to permanently turn off their firewall. Every single time I turned it off permanently - there it was again. It turned itself back on. The problem was with 2 firewalls running, I had difficulty getting the Internet pages to come up.The ccapp constantly hangs the system. I was reading another post, it is true, it does a poor job of catching viruses and stopping them - and even if it knows of the virus, cannot seem to remove or delete it.I don't know what's going on at Symantec, but I'm very disappointed.I would advise against this using this product.
__label__1 Awful: All right, it gets one star for being catchy, but that's it. This is a vile song with awful lyrics. I'm surprised women everywhere haven't risen up to beat the pants off of Petey Pablo.(Also, the 24, 34, 46 measurement he gave is physically impossible. But I would have loathed it anyway)
__label__2 Yes!: I LOVE this book!! My midwife suggested it since I was having my 1st child (and 1st home birth!!) and was having some fears regarding childbirth. I'm so stoked she told me to buy it! Seriously, best book to read while pregnant (and Hypnobirth!!). It took the fear out of childbirth and really cemented in my mind that I'd made the right choice for myself. Now that my daughter is 4 months old I'm more then thrilled with the avenue we chose and I feel I was as prepared as I could have possibly gotten thanks to these two books, good midwives, and lots of research!!
__label__2 Needful Knowledge for Born Again Believers in Jesus Christ: I have only read excerpts from this book at demonbuster.com but this book proclaims victory in Jesus Christ, in alignment with the power of God's Living Word and the redemptive power of His blood.If you desire to overcome every weapon and wile of the enemy, study the Word and follow the example of warriors like Ruth Brown.The blood of Jesus heals us, restores us and renews us.The blood of Jesus breaks every spirit, scheme, curse and device of the enemy and his agents acting against us and our households. Amen.
__label__1 very outdated software: I purchased this (and other) software because it was described as bring compatible with the mac OS. Unfortunately it is only compatible with mac OS 9. The last time that this OS was distributed was nine years ago. So the software is unusable on any current mac, which means that our household cannot use the software either.A waste of money that could have been avoided with a more accurate product description.
__label__1 Wait... maybe this IS a great product, but...: I'm editing this review the day after I posted it... The problem that I was having inexplicably went away the today. Another reviewer had posted the exact same problem. Tech support said to live with it for a few days, and if the problem returns, let them know and they'd send a replacement. Incidentally, I bought the iPod (30 gig)to replace a 200 disk cd changer that died. WOW this is better! Also, I'd change my rating to 4 stars, but it's not letting me. Here's what I wrote yesterday: The dock works great, except I have to turn the iPod volume all the way up, and then crank my stereo volume up as well. I'll be sending this back. The first time I switch to FM while listening to the iPod, my speakers and ears are going to fry!
__label__1 stinks: i would rather go back to the sixtys and by a newspaper. this is completly a waste of money and time. pathetic. i thought kindle was better than that. i bought a new kindle just for this and this is what i find?!?!? it leaves out everything that we want to read.
__label__2 Cutest movie!: I looked at the movie previews and I thought "This doesn't seem like a bad movie". Then it came out on video. I didn't see it until like a few months or a year after it came out. When I finally saw it, I was asking myself why I've never seen it before! It's cute! If you like movies like Loser and Austin Powers (1 or 2) than you'll love this movie! I was laughing so much! It even takes place where i live. I know this movie will go in my DVD collection and you HAVE to get this!
__label__1 Sentimental pap: This book was recommended to me by a friend whose judgment I ordinarily trust. Unlike her promise, I couldn't wait to put it down! I don't mind well-written fantasy - say, Hundred Years of Solitude - but this just isn't close. It is cute, sentimental, a challenge to anyone's ability to suspend disbelief. Don't waste your time.
__label__1 Trite: I have a lot of respect and admiration for the late Tupac Shakur, and he's actually one of my favorite rap artists, though, admittedly, I am not the biggest fan of rap. Unfortunately, this book of poems does not serve him any justice. He did write these during his teens so he may not have found his voice or his calling quite yet, so that's understandable, but the poems themselves are basically cliches written in the syntax and spelling of most rap artists. This book is mainly for die hard fans of 2Pac or completists who are doing research or whatever. Other than that, get one of his albums.
__label__1 BOSS : SEASON 1: THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING THING I HAVE SEEN LATELY. I AM SO ASHAMED OF KELSEY GRAMMER. THERE IS NO NEED FOR THE LANGUAGE IN THIS SHOW. I HAVE THROWN IT AWAY AND WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE LIKE IT, IF I CAN HELP. I HAD NOT SEEN THE SHOW AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT KELSEY WOULD STOOP TO THIS KIND OF ACTING. IN THE PAST, I ENJOYED HIS SHOWS. NOW I HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON HIS ABILITIES. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING GOOD ABOUT THIS SHOW. I DID NOT WANT TO GIVE IT ANY STARS, THE REVIEW MADE IT HAVE ONE.
__label__1 She goes too fast!: I felt this workout in my arms. But, she does the movements too fast!! Initially, she does them slowly, but then she speeds up--I was concerned about doing the exercises improperly. This is the same reason I hate TaeBo.
__label__2 An Enjoyable, engaging book: This book was a delight to read from start to finish. The Mantle's were people I would want as family friends. This showed that spiritual warfare isn't just for the heros of the Bible, it's for everyday people, everyday. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it wasn't long enough!!!! :) Please let Kylee run the rest of the races!"Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us," (Hebrews 12:1)
__label__1 Waste of Money, Waste of Time, Waste of a Book.......: I got extremely bored with this book. The thing is, I had to read it for a summer reading program I was in so I couldn't quit reading. This is how the story plays out:Beginning: There's a kid named Ruddi who wants to climb a mountain that his father died on. (Stupid, Right?)He goes to the base of the mountain and rescues some guy named Captain Winter.Middle: He goes on a journey with his uncle and the Winter guy. Then they go back down. (They seem to back down like five times)End: I'll let you find out, that is, if you buy this terrible terrible book.Sounds boring, doesn't it? A girl in the class whom I knew pretended to read the book, that's how boring it was. Well, if you're a climber you can probably relate to this but otherwise, you're better off without this dust-collector.
__label__2 Down Jacket: This down jacket seems to be of good quality worksmanship. The the thickness of the down is light. It is well suited for the temperate climate where winters are not as harsh as the northern states. Overall I consider it an excellent bargain for the price.
__label__1 Great Expectations is possibly the worst book ever: You guys should never read this book everCharles Dickens just goes on and on trying to make a point that you can do in a sentence. He takes the whole chapter. I don't recomend this for anyone. Only read it if forced to. It is not a good book.
__label__2 Aglok Tying Fastener Chain: Used it for tying up fragile trees in my yard. It's strong and works great. Hard to find in stores after season, bought it cheaper on line.
__label__2 Grew on me: At first I really had a hard time with this CD. Then, it truly grew on me. I like all the songs except 'sea song'. Love bloodletting go, lords of karma, schrodinger's cat,, the way you are, and new star are my favorite tracks. It is somewhat 'eclectic' as a collection, but what the hey it is music.
__label__1 Where is the Misfits!: This cd is pure guitar noise! No vocals. It is a disgrace to the original misfits. Graves blows on most of the songs. Where is his energy. Glenn needs to get back and make things like the once were.
__label__1 cop and a half: I bought this Dvd only to find it will not play on my Dvd player so i am now stuck with a brand new Dvd that wont play.
__label__2 Water for Elephants: I saw the movie preview and decided to read the book first. What a great read! There were a few adult moments, but once I passed those, the book was so beautifully written! I couldn't wait to see it in the theater the minute I finished. The movie was a big letdown. Can't even compare to the book! Thankfully the adult parts were left out but so were so many pivital important parts and characters. I'm sad that the movie did not reach the level my imagination took me to in reading the book. Want a great summer read...read this book, but skip the movie. The characters, words, scenery and your imagination are soooo much better in the book! I've already referred this read to my friends!
__label__2 Great for Certain Sized Heads - Medium: This is a comfortable, sturdy, high quality sounding headset for a good low price. It is my third and so far favorite headset for my home phone (at half the price). I'm using it w/ the Panasonic phone i just bought. I move, it doesn't. I can strut around the house like Madonna on tour and never have to adjust it. I stuff it in drawers and it pops right back when I extract it. It has a comfortable cushy ear piece. People don't complain that I sound distant. The only problem I could forsee is it doesn't seem really adjustable for people with larger heads. I have a medium sized head and if you do too, this may be the one for you.
__label__1 non functioning: Item did not work. Thought it might be the batteries, so bought new ones. No dice, just broken
__label__2 Contains some but not all of the original story: Well, if you seen my review for the second season set, it's the same for this one as well.So if your a fan of fullmetal alchemist, I encourage you to buy this in hopes that the lady who made the original manga can get some money off this awesome series.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY PEACHTREE: I too have used Peachtree for years but they have lost a customer. This new version with the Pervasie hogs all the memory causing your system to be too slow to use. Customer service is the worst; I was on hold more like 40 minutes only to speak to someone with their canned answers. They wouldn't pay me a rebate that I was entitled to because I called to late; 5 days too late. Don't waste your time or money.
__label__2 A good overall collection, but.....: If there ever was a diverse (or maybe weird is the word?) collection of Mrs. Streisand's hits, this is it. As a above review said, this was a big (if not the biggest) period in her musical career.There are numerous good songs here. Woman in Love still is as powerful as it was in 1980. Somewhere is still the showstopper of this set (once again, if not for her career). Guilty, Coming in & out of your life, and What kind of Fool are still excellent. I always liked the Main Event & the Way He Makes Me Feel.However everything seems somewhat out of place with each other. The disco with the Broadway tunes? I know this covers this period, however the Broadway songs could have been placed on a separate set. This is a good start for the casual fan, but Guilty and the Broadway Album go along very well with this set. It's worth it just for two songs: Promises & Not While I'm Around. Let me know what you think :)
__label__2 Works fine.: Shop around! I found these anywhere from $20 to $8 shipped! They do seem to work fine and don't look too bad either. I put them in studs and would be a little wary about just sheet rock.
__label__1 A Very Mixed Bag: This DVD produced by (shudder) Madacy offers a very good Laurel and Hardy film ("Flying Deuces") with a very, very poor one ("Utopia", AKA "Atoll K"). Bad picture quality (with compression) is evident on both films, along with wafer thin sound.The extras are typical of Madacy. There's a trivia game, filmography, and some biographies.All in all, you should stay away from this to find a better transfer of 'Flying Deuces.'
__label__1 Poor assistance from Amazon: I bought this item 1 week prior to the release of the new improved version (that came with the same price), Amazon didn't mention the upcoming release.It's a shame Amazon sells obsolete things for the same price with no warning
__label__2 More Holiday Ha-Ha-Has: Another title for this review might be "Ha ! I knew it !" or something like that. This has the episodes of Johnny Bravo and I Am Weasel I have predicted earlier in the volume one review; as does the Eds' "Jingle Jingle Jangle" holiday special.And since this DVD is called "Christmas ROCKS", the bonus episodes have something to do with music. For example, there's the Billy and Mandy episode where Grim plays some goth metal of sorts(he almost sings like Marylin Manson if you know what I mean).I'm not sure if they'll make a volume three, which might also have the other Snowman-themed episode of Courage, but I hear they're making a Kids Next Door holiday special called "Operation N.A.U.G.H.T.Y." and also a Billy and Mandy holiday episode, I think. In the meantime, I'll enjoy this and the first volume as well.(I'm still anxious for a Valentine's Day DVD, though !)
__label__2 AWESOME: This is one of the best investments (cd-wise) that I have made in a long time. 'I Get Wet' brings back the joy of rock and roll. No rap garbage, nothing that makes you go "What's happening to music these days?!?" Just good old fashioned kick you in the a&* rock. People have said for months now that Andrew W.K. will be the saviour of rock music, and I can say nothing but "I whole-heartedly agree." Do yourself a favor and buy this album, you won't regret it.
__label__2 Incredible First Novel: If you read no other book this summer, READ THE HOLLOW!! This is a FABULOUS book by first time novelist, Todd Hayes. Great protagonist, Sidney Thorn the biochemist trying to make it big with his research grant. Great science, Thorn trying to figure out the chemical basis of fear. Great serial killers, William Brandy is so suave, you'd gladly give him your head! Because of this book's incredible surprise ending, it is definitely at the top of my recommend list!!
__label__1 cheap rollers: I found the rowing machine fairly easy to assemble, and seemed to be sturdy and well designed. I like the motion of the rowers and it is easy to adjust the tension. The problems came when I started working out with it. I weigh 170 lbs. and the first time I used it I began to see plastic shavings on the roller tracks. The seat still moved, but it wasn't very smooth. When I got down to look at why this was happening, I saw one of the rollers had fallen apart. The inner metal lining of the wheel had popped out causing the wheel itself to roll off kilter. I took the track apart to access the seat and rollers. I managed to slip the metal parts back in place. After I got it put back together and tried again, another roller did the same thing. I still have to contact the manufacturer and see if there are better rollers available. If not It is pretty much worthless as an exercise device.
__label__1 Highly disappointed: This was a Plus size elizabethan costume. The material was what is to be expected from a $50 halloween costume- you want nice you have to pay a lot more. There were two problems. The first and main problem is Plus size women tend to be well endowed. The costume fit everywhere but the bosom area. The only plus size women the costume would have fit would have to be absolutely flat chested, as I am sure the model probably was. Even taped down I could have never fit my ample chest into this thing. And if you were taller than 5' 5" the costume would be too short. The additional curves of a plus size drew it up some. I am 5'10" and it came halfway up to my knees- not even close to the ground.The makers need to realize that there is more to a plus size outfit than adding a little extra material on the sides. Buyers beware.
__label__1 HOW CAN THEY CALL THIS COUNTRY??? LOOK AT THE COVER!!: All one has to do is look at the cover to realize that what is selling these days is 'trashy sex'. All one has to do is give the samples a listen to realize this is not country music! I'll stick to buying old classic vinyls and listening to them on my turntable when country was Real and talent and especially class acts ruled the roost with legends like Cash, Wynette, Ray Price, Merle Haggard, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton......heck...even bring back Crystal Gayle...she'd make these country/pop wannabes look like gum stuck under an old shoe. Forget this CD.....unless you're one of the masses that likes this low class garbage, like all of the what is supposedly called 'country' (and I use the term loosely) these days!!!
__label__1 terrible product: After several month of minimum use, the XLR connector starts to produce all kinds of connection problem. Don't buy this brand, they must have been using the cheapest material in the connector.
__label__2 Complete Preludes for Piano: Complete Preludes for Piano is a Hyperion Records recording from 2000 starring pianist Piers Lane. Mr Lane plays with intense passion and I feel that he truly understands the music of Scriabin. Simon Nicholls has written the music notes and also included is a short biography of Mr. Lane. A very beautiful painting is on the cover. A very good choice. A very enjoyable recording indeed. I loved it. Highly recommended. 5/5.
__label__2 A mini-delight for your N Scale train: The little individual autos stacked into this train car are removable so can be used as part of the scenery too. I can't wait to give this unique train car to my (7 yr old) grandson for Christmas.
__label__1 Bought used 1 time and now its not working: Bought the pyle wireless mic system to add to an existing microphone system I have. I was skeptical because of the inexpensive price $13 but I purchased anyway. Used the wireless mic one time just testing it out and it seemed to work well for the money but it quit working shortly after that. I changed batteries and still nothing. I have come to the conclusion that you get what you pay for and would never advise anyone to waste their money and time on this unit.
__label__2 A beautiful timepiece: This watch looks just awesome - the blue is almost cobalt, and the dial itself is very easy to read. So why only four stars? My complaint, as with my other Movado, is that the links in the bracelet are oversized. Taking out one link means the watch is still a bit "dangly" on the wrist, but removing two links results in the watch being too tight, which is even more uncomfortable.That criticism aside however, I highly recommend this watch. In fact, I highly recommend Movado as a brand. Their quality is superb.
__label__2 Fantastic and fun toy: My son is 16 months old and loves this toy. Shaking the cars builds muscle strength and aids in cause and effect learning. The only disadvantage is that the batteries do not seem to last long. All in all, you can enjoy hours of fun.
__label__1 Don't buy. It's included in Season 1 pack.: It's Battlestar Galactica! Awesome in every way except for price. This is actually part of season 1. Buying this then season 1 is only going to upset you. I was lucky and returned my copy before I broke the plastic. But if you are rich and don't care, the show itself is AWESOME. Probably helps if you liked the old series or are a science fiction fan.
__label__1 Maybe something was lost in the translation.: The movie was brilliant compared to the book. Monosyllabic diction. Forced symbolism. Dull.
__label__1 Disappointing: It took me three weeks to read this book, for it was just not interesting. The parts in the book where they wrote the lyrics to the songs with that riffs and everything was just too distracting. The ending was good though, I almost cried. But I almost cried while reading the book because it took too long to get to the point. In the space of reading this book, I sat and read three other books, and this one was read as a last resort when I had nothing else to read. It may be interesting to people that are into that stuff.
__label__1 Didn't last long: I bought my BOSS used off Craigslist and though I don't remember the price I was an offer I couldn't refuse. It was very well cared for, had the owners manual, original box and showed little or no signs of use. The red disks didn't even have any paint worn off from use yet. I really liked the large table surface and how quiet the machine was. I had only used it a couple of times before I had to put it to the test. I bet I hadn't put 2 hours on the machine when it started vibrating. Then the smell of a burning motor. Then the spindle slowed to a crawl. While it was still oscillating, it was losing power. Then smoke.Then I got on Amazon here and began to read the reviews.Major disappointment. If I had the floor space I'd buy the stationary Jet sander. It has a much beefier motor, the moving gears are lubricated in oil, and it looks like it's built to last.I might try to fix this Delta model, but it looks like I might have to write it off as a lesson learned.
__label__1 Harry Potter Stinks: I have watched a few of the Harry Potter movies and I just don't understand why people like it. I really dislike it.
__label__2 The Temples are in fine form: Paul, Steve and Sir Graham Forbes are on the track of "Gilbert". The usual wonderful mixture of visiting Americans, nighclubs, martinis and murder. I've been under the spell of the Temples for fifty years. Francis Durbridge made an entire career writing this material and I've spent a small fortune buying it all. Money well spent "By Timothy" - another winner with Pater Coke and the superb Marjorie Westbury in the lead roles. Don Wardell Palm Springs CA
__label__2 Nice and compact abacus for kids: Its a nice and compact abacus for kids, and it is made of wood and iron, not just plastic. I didn't give 5 stars because it has plastic beads.
__label__1 teases, but never delivers: This book was frustrating in some ways. It start giving details about parts of AI, then it stops. It covers to much material, and with not enough detail. It does list the references, so you can always go there and get more detail.If you have a decent background in calculus, then the mathematics in this book should not be that daunting. If you are a philosophy major trying to learn about AI, then you might find this book difficult.I really don't see much difference between this book and some of the other intro to AI books on the market. They try to cover to much material and something is bound to be left uncovered or superficially covered.
__label__1 For the beginner's beginner: This book is for people who are almost entirely unfamiliar with the info product field. If you're a writer who's already pushed to get your work out there, if you've started a semi-successful website or blog, or if you have a semi-successful service- or product-based business, I'm going to guess you already know a thing or two about marketing, e-commerce, etc.As such, this book is too basic. Each chapter was like a good first chapter of a whole book that could've been written with more detail and guidance. I wish the author had taken chapters 7-10 and wrote more about those topics alone, and included more in-depth coverage and real insider tips.Bottom line: If you're looking to dip your toes in the water, this book will do the trick. It's a simple and cursory glance (in the style of ehow.com) at the whole info product field. If you're already in the water (say, knee or waist deep) and were looking to boost your game or refine your knowledge, you'll be pretty disappointed.
__label__2 Great Music: I have 2 boys 1 & 3. They both loved this toy and are still playing with it! They love the music the best. They both can get the music going but it is a little hard to draw on. Usually my 3 yr old draws and my 1 yr old dances. As for durability, my 3yr old keeps standing on it, and its still here. I think that is pretty durable. Over all, I think this toy is probably best for a 3yr old, but heaps of fun for all!
__label__1 Poor Quality: I was disappointed with this product and found that it, as a re-furbished kettle, it still did not function properly. Most importantly the automatic shutoff did not work, the spout filter fell-out every time you turned over the kettle to pour water excess water out into the sink and the exterior got extremely hot - scalding if you touched it.
__label__2 Lighting theif: The best book ever! It is a great book for young readers because it is adventurous and exciting. It is a great book.
__label__2 ClownHouse Is What Horror Is About: This particular movie is great because it brings out what a scary movie should be......something people are scared of.....clowns!! I have been a long time fan of this movie and am happy it is finally coming to DVD. If you are a horror movie fan.....then don't miss this...Be Down Wit' The Clown! JuggaloJoe420
__label__2 One of the best books ever!: I enjoyed this book so much that I have my own copy and have bought copies for friends. Not only is it full of interesting and amazing medical facts but it is also very amusing.
__label__2 @ cont. dining chairs.: Arrived on time. Easy to put together and comfortable. I love the way my dining room looks now!!
__label__1 Very dissappointed: I purchased the EAS Active after reading several of the reviews. I was VERY dissapointed with this product. I spent most of my workout time trying to get the game to pick up on my movements. Unfortunately, because the game is opened, it is not returnable. Money down the drain. Think twice before buying this - it is a piece of junk!
__label__1 To Marry an English Lord: I thought this a very slow moving retrospective on English heraldry. Many books I've read contained more details and interesting stories without being dry and lifeless. Sorry I bought it.
__label__1 Sterling Silver Band Citrine Gemstone Ring: I was very disappointed with this ring. The color of the stones were too yellow making the ring look like a child's prize from a dispenser.
__label__2 title?: Some of the best music I've heard in years. The sound is at once both reminiscent and fresh. They remind me of some of the early Beatles' finest work, with a little Alan Parsons and Gerry Rafferty thrown in for good measure. Try it. You'll like it!
__label__1 Is this partisan politics or ignorance?: Ever since Reagan looked into our cameras and said "I did not sell arms to Iran," America has, sadly, accepted outright lying by our Presidents. Clinton, about Lewinsky (and, come on, other matters), but Republicans about SELLING WEAPONS TO OUR ENEMIES (Iran)FOR PRIVATELY RUN WARS(Contras), to which Bush Sr. was a party. Neither Reagan nor Bush was ever impeached -- indeed, Reagan continues to be idolized. And now this supposed "Democrat" supposedly "goes against his party" to "reveal" the behind-the-scenes Clinton-impeachment scandals! Get serious.
__label__1 A tall order with disappointing results: A somewhat parched production. Kerlogue far overstretches her abilities and consistently betrays a lack of intuition, personal engagement with her subjects, and intellectual insight. She lags behind other writers who have given us far livelier, more deeply informative books that are enjoyable to read. This author should stick to museum work.
__label__1 NO CHARGER AND NOT RESPONSIVE ENOUGH: In short get the LOGITECH MX 700 instead. Superior in comfort, performance and battery life irrelevant because of built in charger (hello Microsoft). I'm so happy I switched.
__label__2 Great CD from Celine, like alwayz: This CD is very great CD that Celine has released. This CD was released when she was on her 2 year hiatus, with her baby of when she wanted to have 1. The Collector's Series Volume One has some of her biggest hit songs such as, Where Does My Heart Beat Now, Pour Que Tu M'Aimes Encore, and That's The Way It Is. Now.. there are some songz missing on this CD, that were forgotten to be put onto this CD, which are... Call The Man, Nothing Broken But My Heart, Immortality and Treat Her Like A Lady! Those are some of my favourite koolie songz. But even tho they don't have those songz on there or any other song any of yall would want on there still buy this CD. It is very great album that Celine has made...
__label__2 The only 12 volt plug you should ever buy: I really hate cigarette lighter plugs but this one is by far the best one out there. The twist lock feature is a must. I use this plug for my onboard fridge mounted in the cargo area of my truck.
__label__2 Worked like a Charm: The Shelter used the cheap stuff, Strongid, which did nothing to kill the tapeworm.Just one dose and gone! I retreated 21 days later and nothing, so they are still gone.TY!!
__label__1 This is not the "Grandaddy of them all": I saw this thing on PPV, and it was horrid. Possibly the second worst Starrcade ever, 1994 being the worst ever. If you want a Real Starrcade, I suggest you check out the ones from the 80's and possibly 1996.
__label__1 What is the deal with the breasts?: I thought this was a cute lighthearted book. I came across it on vacation and read it on the beach. Perfect fair for the surroundings. But I noticed that every time, EVERYTIME, he described a woman character, he described her boobs. It became distracting, and then just plain annoying.
__label__2 My new favorite toy!!!: I use the korg kp3 with my turntables as an effect tool and it work incredibly well. the synth portion is kinda lackin but i guess thats why there is a kaossilator pro. this can be used to do minor phasers and filters and you can also get pretty crazy with it. also very fun to use the vocoders or just put filters on your voice. i have not used the sampling features as much as i thought i would but they seem to work very well and all the effects can be applied to your samples. i just cant get enought of this thing.
__label__2 Worked the first time.: I was running out of room on my system drive (C:) after installing XP, especially after turning on the system recovery process that eats up alot of HD space. I had plenty of room on my other two partitions, so I purchased Partition Magic. It installed easy, and was very easy to use. Do back up before you rearrange or change your system. Every machine is different. I have used it twice to reallocate my free space between partitions with no problems at all.
__label__1 Hardware: This game does not work well with ATI Radeon cards. I have a 7200 64mg card along with more than enough to cover the specs and the game was choppy and slow. Come to find out its a programming bug, apparently the designers prefer nvidia.What I was able to experience was not overly exciting anyway, save your money people!
__label__1 Buyer beware: I mixed up my favorite waffle recipe in anxious anticipation of delicious waffles. No matter how little or how much batter I placed in it, it mostly went to the middle portion and ran out the front and the back. What a mess. We could not get it to work right. We were terribly disappointed.
__label__1 nycdistrict: really? no more than a lame, boring attempt at a made for TV movie script, and bad even on that level- I like TV, so please let this book kill itself like Lucretia #1
__label__2 The Daniel O'Donnell Show: Daniel O'Donnell Is the most entertaining & versatile singer & performer that I have ever encountered. It is so refreshing to watch his videos or to listen to his cd's. I have a collection of both & I never tire of watching him or listening to him. I am looking forward to attending one of his concerts live in the U. S. A. in November in Branson, Mo. I know that it will be a most enjoyable experience. I highly recommend Daniel to anyone who enjoys good wholesome entertainment.
__label__1 Boring !!!: Despite the stars in this movie, it is a very boring affair. Hoods is about a wise guy played by Joe Mantegna who is assigned by his father to kill somebody by the name of "Carmine Delaroza" who turns out to be a 9 year olds kid. Despite being sold as a comedy, this movie is not funny. The DVD is in full screen. No closed captioning (despite there is a CC on the back of the jacket). No Dolby 5.1 either. The picture quality is OK. Avoid this. Not worth it.
__label__1 Hearing impaired...: The tone on these TV Ears doesn't adjust enough for my type of hearing loss.It has too much bass. Also, they didn't work on one of my TV's (only one audio out connection)without me having to buy an audio cord with a male connector on both ends. I passed them on to friends, though, and they just love them!
__label__1 Couldn't Be Worse: I agree with the majority of other reviewers who disliked this book. It is poorly written with a terrible plot and an emphasis on meanness. Some reviewers have given it 5 stars because their child likes it. My son is 2 and loves it but that isn't enough for me. Reading the nasty dialog makes me uncomfortable and I can't get past the numerous unexplained events. I don't care if it is based on some movie version of the Thomas TV series. Save your money for another of the many high-quality Thomas books that are available.
__label__1 Too Bad Rick Steves Doesn't go This Far South: Yes, as other reviewers write, Ellen Grady's book is full of rich and detailed history of the places you'll visit, but it lacks essential practical information. We used it only for Taormina (beautiful town, highly recommended) and Catania (Sicily's second largest city, which you could skip), so the book may be more helpful elsewhere on the island. As for these two destinations, the book lacked essential information (like the frequency and cost of various public transportation options between towns). Also, it had virtually no narrative description of restaurants, just a mere listing. If I wanted history, I would have bought a history book. I wanted practical information to get the best out of our short time on the island, this book didn't have it.
__label__1 Clarks Women's Newbeat Sandal, Black, 7M: Based on previous experience, it's a very good sandal.The pair I received, however, was mis-marked, i.e., it was approximately1/2 inch longer than my existing Clarks sandal, also marked 7M. I wassorry to have to return the shoes, which had been tried on priorto shipping to me. The store should have known from that customer'sreaction that the shoe was a larger size than marked.
__label__1 lets run this one through the crapper: puhleese! this album is a shame to green day and all of their previous albums. american idiot is not their best work in fact it doesn't even sound like the green day i know and love. this is not a five star album its elementary in everything that makes it up. the music, the vocals THE SONGS IN GENERAL. a complete dissappointment-
__label__1 Alligator Creek: This book is the worst I've ever read. It is nothing but a collection of poorly written 'sexcapades', including pedophilia and tricks. The author should devote herself to a worthwhile endeavor.
__label__1 I still can't evaluate the product..: I cannot comment on the quality of the product, because after two attempts, i was unable to get one delivered to me in good condition. The packaging is so poor that the product is almost guaranteed to be banged up by the time it gets to you.If you're prepared to spend much time and effort dealing with shipping problems and lugging around this 110lb box, and then repackaging it when you open it and find that the door is broken, then good luck and hopefully the product will work if you eventually get it in one piece
__label__2 Praise: Fast with great colors. Able to set exactly how I want to things to print. Copies so well I can't tell the difference between the original and the copy. A tad noisier than my last printer but still a great product.
__label__1 No room for medical / psychiatric conditions: I have already reviewed this book, and explained that there is only blame for the parents and important adults in the child's life for being shy. Many, many people have emailed me, requesting more information about what other explanations there could be, because their children are not shy due to their environment of happy loving families. So this is an update to my original review.The book does not mention any treatable organic causes for apparent shyness in children, including but not limited to anxiety disorder, social phobia, and Asperger's Syndrome. None of these issues are discussed at all. This is a serious and inexcusable omission. All of them are treatable and controllable by medication and therapy. It seriously angers me that this book does nothing to address these concerns.
__label__2 Uplifting and Inspiring!: Prior to reading this book, I knew little of Buddhism. Careful study of it helped me to deeply appreciate the religion and the wisdom it holds. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Buddhism!
__label__1 Freezes and locks up: I didn't paid attention to the customers that described this router behaviour... Forget using anything like EMule, Kazaa, DCC or VoIP software with this router, it will freeze randomly and very (I mean VERY) frequently. It will also lock up when the network demand a higher throughput.
__label__2 Very Good: Just as decribed in display...Unbelievable price for this item...Like to see more items for sale like this for the price listed. These domed bags are getting harder to find and are usually overpriced. Good deal...
__label__2 if you werent taught, this book will teach you: I read this book a while ago, and I think I liked it so much I read it too fast :) But I see on here that there are some not so good reviews. I thought this book was fantastic! If you are familiar with Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend, you are familiar with their biblicaly backed up work. In this book, they explore what makes an unsafe person, how we attract unsafe people, and how to find safe people. Another "problem to solution" book of theirs. They give a solution after breaking down the problem. After reading this book, I realized that some of the realationships in my life were unsafe and why. This book gave me courage to let go of these unsafe relationships or challenge them. To some people, determining safe people comes easy, but it doesnt always come easy to me. I may have an internal inkling that something isnt right, but I dont know why or how to solve it. This book is helpful in that regard.
__label__1 As of now, does not work with Vista: I would like to review this product, but as of now, there is no way for me to install it since there is no Vista support. I need to use the WS Anywhere Access program to do anything with the drive, and it refuses to install under Vista.Worse, there is no acknowledgment on Western Digital's site, and there is no User Forum to see what others have done for work arounds, if any.
__label__2 superior imaging, natural mids, smooth highs..: KEF isn't a name most are familiar with in the US but should be. KEF differs from the competition in that they use a coaxial midrange/tweeter design. The advantage is mostly in coherency and imaging. The low range drivers flesh things out and blend seamlessly. Regardless, a sub is definitely recommended. They're capable of filling a large room without distorting. When they do reach their limit, the bass drivers chuff a little. They're very smooth and comparable to a pair of speakers I use with ribbon tweeters. In the world of higher end speakers, these are definitely a bargain. The fit and finish is excellent with a unique cabinet design. Two pairs of banana plugs are available for those that want to bi-amp or bi-wire. Note that the 600 price Amazon lists is for one speaker. You'll pay 1200 for a pair. If you're shopping product in this price range from B&W, Paradigm and others, KEF should be on your list.
__label__1 bad movie: time for some of these guys to retirenot worth the price. and its crazy to have to have a certain number of words in the review
__label__2 Great Deal on Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser!!: I priced this item in stores like WalMart and it was much cheaper thru Amazon. I've been using a Waterpik for years and this particular model is more compact and comes with additional accessories in its own storage container. Very easy to use... really a great deal!
__label__2 a good read!: i heard mr. mezrich promoting his book on the jim rome show and promptly ordered a copy for myself.what a terrific story! a real page turner! i wish i would have had adventures like that in college!
__label__1 Dont buy Garrity headlamp KHO21G: This is barely an average headlamp. I have a few that sold for about the same price. This head lamp is highly over rated and you can find a better one at any Wal Mart or Target. I wish I had my money back.
__label__2 These are big crayons!: The colors are good and the size is great for younger children. They are very sturdy. These are a good addition to a Crayon collection. They wouldn't be appropriate as the only Crayons for an older child, but I think everyone will enjoy them for some projects and smaller children will find them easier to use.
__label__2 GREAT FOR THE JOB: I USE MY OLYMPUS VN-4100PC FOR CORRECTION NOTE AS I WALK WITH THE FIRE INSPECTORS THROUGH THE BUILDINGS AT PORTLAND STATE UNIVERSITY. THIS ALLOWS ME TO GET A START ON THE CORRECTIONS BEFORE THEY ARRIVE IN WRITING. WITH 57 BUILDINGS IT CAN GET OVERWHELMING AND EVERY ADVANTAGE HELPS.
__label__1 Belt Leather Belt??? AHHHH UHHHHH: These have to be the most uncomfertable headphones I have ever worn. They look like they were supposed to be some kind of around ear headphones but the lack of depth for the speakers has them constantly pressing up against the ear. After about 30 minutes they become extremely painful. The sound quality is just mediocre. Turning on the SRS only seams to make it louder but doesnt rally enhanse the sound quality any. The only part that was good about it was the mic, and that quit working. The cords seam to get frayed quite easily and because of that the mic no longer works. These headphones are terrible. Do your self a favor and don't buy them. Infact even if they had phenominal sound quality that was unmatched I would still give it 1 star just for how uncomfertable they are.
__label__2 Great fusion of rock and house: Paul mac is one of the greatest aussie techno/housesque songwriters and Daniel Johns is one of the greatest aussie rock songwriters. I can't believe it's not rock does even come close to the quality of this single. The title track, like Silverchair's "Greatest View", has raw, fun, and exciting energy with catchy melodies. "Thinking In Reverse" starts with a very experimental techno feel and goes into a simple rock beat, in a very appealing way. "Goodnight" has an incredible jazz feel to it. It has the brushed snare, glocks, rhodes, bass, and with Paul's effects, makes a unusually pleasent effect on the listener. I am excitedly awaiting the CD to come out!
__label__1 Horrible: This is a grotesque portrayal of a truly sick teen popular culture. The main character is a rich sixteen-year-old girl who not only is vacuous and spoiled but actually takes great pride in living her life in this pathetic way. Most or all of her friends have similar attitudes or lifestyles. In short, this movie was not good; it was bad and it was ugly. If you were intrigued by the few redeeming qualities of Cher, such as her interest in helping other people find happiness, read Jane Austen's novel Emma, which Clueless is based upon. Emma is full of well-mannered, cultured characters and dialogue; it contains none of the offensive mannerisms or sick humor of Clueless--the worst film of 1995, and one of the saddest, most pathetic movies you will ever see.
__label__2 Gteat: This stuff really works! I just start with a clean bird bath and add a few drops ode a week and I have a clean bird bath the rest of the summer!
__label__1 John Deere Tractor Toy: Please don't waste your money on this toy. While the idea of the tractor is fix it and play. This toy came out of the box not working. I was embarassed when the toy would not stay together. It has many problems. It looks cute, but again it does not work. My nephew was frustrated with the toy. Stay clear of this tractor.
__label__1 quick read, shallow story: Cook has the idea right on this one, but doesn't seem to know where to follow through. First he's focusing on the managed health care dilema in our society and then he decides that the USDA and slaughter-houses are a better target. Finally, he thinks that by throwing in a hit-man he'll keep the reader's attention. Sorry, no dice. It was a quick read with no real substance that I cared about.
__label__2 Excellent-a classic book: I read this book 10 years ago while studying my Masters deggree in The Netherlands. I found it very interesting and really supportive for my thesis. all sudents of IR should have it. Unfortunatelly, I did not not buy it at that time. Currently I work in the Chile s Agency of International Cooperation and I am a lecturer of Intenational Relations in various Universities. I would like to make contacts with those people interested in development aid. My name is Rafael Sabat.
__label__1 Susan Estrich has no ideas of her own.: This book would be better titled "Susan Estrich: No original ideas and Clueless". Estrich is one of the leaders of the movement to take away free speech, and she doesn't understand the truth that comes from Ann Coulter's tongue-in-cheek assessments of the socialist liberal left. Perhaps she understands all too well, and therefore this cynical book, and obvious attempt to make money by imitating and slandering a true American, is really an effort to quash the truth. The Bible says it well: In the end times, men will call good evil, and evil good. Susan is the queen of twisting good to cal it evil, and making evil sound like the norm and that which is good. Don't waste your money, unless you are doing research like Ann to understand the evil mind and black heart of those people who have the mental disease of liberalism.
__label__2 Saw the WWI museum in KC and wanted to know more...: Recently visited the WWI museum in Kansas City (awesome), and wanted to know more about WWI. This was the first book I have read on the subject, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I had read other reviews on this book, and this one seemed to have made a very good impression with most readers. I would recommend this book (and the museum!) to anyone wanting to know more.
__label__1 May contain scratched CDs: I've purchased Memorex CDs by mail through this site several times, and will continue to do so since they don't go on sale very often in my area anymore. Twice so far the CD cake boxes were broken upon receipt. In the first instance the CDs themselves were fine. In my March 7th purchase the cake box was damaged enough that I had to transfer the CDs to a different cake box, and found that several CDs--five so far of the hundred--were scratched and unusable. The CDs themselves are reliable when not damaged, and they are shipped quickly but definitely need to be packaged more securely.UPDATE: 34 OF THE 100 CDS WERE SCRATCHED OR OTHERWISE MARKED. I LOOKED INTO ASKING FOR A PARTIAL REFUND BUT FOUND IT IS EITHER ALL OR NOTHING, SO I AM OUT OF LUCK. I HAD TO USE THE CDS THAT WERE UNMARKED--I PURCHASED THEM FOR ARCHIVAL REASONS, AND NEEDED THEM WHEN I PURCHASED THEM. I GUESS IF YOU CAN, BUY YOUR CDS IN PERSON?
__label__2 Beautiful: I gave this to my eight year old niece and was hesitant to handing it over because I wanted to keep it for myself. Like many of the Dolls of the World, they're very beautiful and detailed. I just hope she takes care of her gift.
__label__1 Worked for 3 weeks only!: They were working ok until I washed the clear soft plastic top on (the sipper). I noticed there was dirt under it, between the soft part and the hard plastic part of the lid, and that could only be cleaned if the top (the clear part with the sipper) came off and was washed separately, which seemed ok I guess, after all Nuby should've known that it can get really nasty if we don't wash the lid parts separately. After I did that I but it back exactly like the way it was before and did all the adjustments but they kept on leaking! They leak so bad it's impossible for my baby to use it without having water pouring from everywhere. And the price wasn't too cheap either. Now I have to throw them away because they're just useless.
__label__1 garbage - don't buy: Remote broke after 6 weeks. Player stopped working after 8 weeks. Philips will replace unit under warranty only if I pay to ship it back. A useless product and warranty.
__label__2 Love the Wizard of Oz Toys: I am getting the Wizard of Oz toys for my granddaughter. When she was two, she loved the movie, and I am getting these collectibles for her.
__label__2 By far Madonna's best album to date!: This album is pure perfection! From start to finish with no pauses between songs, Madonna has once again proved herself to be the queen of pop music! This is a dance album by all means which Madonna excels at since she started out as a dance recording artist. I HIGHLY recommend this album for anyone who wants to hear great music that'll keep ya dancing all the way through!
__label__2 One Of My Favorites: I'm proud to have been a part of this CD. I co-wrote "It Can't Be Forever" with George. George was a very close and dear friend of mine. When I record my solo CD I plan to do a remake of "It Can't Be Forever" in memory of my friend. We miss you.
__label__1 Junk: I could not load any songs from a computer and had a hard time loading from a cd. The instruction manual does not help at all. I have an IPod so maybe I am use to drop and drag. I worked on it for at least an hour and could not get any songs loaded. I will be taking it back on December 26th adding a few more bucks and purchasing a real mp3 player.
__label__1 Why Do People Like This So Much?: Wow...this is a really irritating compilation, the early stuff they did is really boring. I don't know why people like this bandso much because I can't stand the Beatles. The only good song is Hey Jude. There are lots of other great bands that are better than the Beatles. Try these bands.Green DayDire Straits/Mark KnopflerGuns N' RosesJoe WalshForeignerAerosmithNirvanaMetallicaFoghatBruce SpringsteenTom PettyJohn MellencampLynyrd SkynyrdThe CarsNeil Young& MORE!!!!Smells Like Teen Spirit The Music Master
__label__2 Loved it!: Both pups really enjoyed this. I have to admit, Merrick brand never seem to go wrong with their items -- they're always a hit with my babies and they tend to be very picky.
__label__1 Don't tamper with an original classic: The original is a classic, complete with the use of the language of the time it was written. To "edit" it for political correctness is unforgivable.
__label__1 Watch Out for this one.: I love Peter and pirates and Mermaids--but this was made in 1951--so Watch Out. I didn't like my 3 yr old hearing things like "girls talk too much" and indians called "redskins" and the WORST was Tinkerbell wondering if her [...] was too fat!! If you are careful about what your littles ones watch, skip this one for now.
__label__2 My favorite book of all time.: My favorite book of all time, and I don't say that lightly. This is a book with a "voice" - the characters are so compelling, and I was able to relate to them completely. I first read it 5 years ago and I often go back and re-read it. I've probably bought 5 copies or so over the years because I keep giving it away to friends saying "you HAVE to read this book!" And, I confess that it is one of the landmarks I judge my friends by - (don't you do that, wait and see if a friend loves your favorite book as much as you do - if so, then you truly might be soul-mates, if not, well I guess there's a gap in understanding)... Anyway, all I can say is I wish I had written this book. It is something to truly be proud of.
__label__2 Going back to school: This is a great collection of songs from the seventies and eighties. It consists mainly of full-length LP or 12-inch versions of funk, disco and R&B; tunes. They generally are in the five to seven minute range. It's certainly a welcome alternative to the edited single versions that are recycled on countless compilations time and again. Eventually, some of these tunes would be sampled in later years by other artists. There are three single versions on this album: "Think (About It)" by Lyn Collins,"Pass The Peas" by The JB's and "September" by EWF. This collection is great for parties or get togethers. If you like extended versions then you'll enjoy this album.The first disc runs 78 minutes and the second 72 minutes.
__label__2 Quality film: The kind of movie that I like to add to my library collection because of the life style, manners, etc. that I want my family to emulate.
__label__2 A Must Have: I can be a little biased because I'm an obcessed Sublime fan. I listen to Sublime at least five days a week. This is one of the three real Sublime albums out there (as in not a compilation) This album has to be the most professionally produced, and comercial of the three. I would recomed it to any type of music lover because this is just great music. Once you buy this one you will have to have 40 oz to freedom and Robbin the Hood. What's more to be said? Just buy it, you won't regret it.
__label__2 Great witness!: This book was packed full of information I chose to read it twice. He goes in great detail sharing the faith of the Great cloud of Witnesses. Anyone who desires more faith or wants a better understanding of that faith, would greatly benefit from this book.
__label__1 pure garbage: I have finished with a third of this book. Kevin states he bought the liquor store in southie with flemmi and bulger. the fact of the matter is they took it. either sell it for a nominal fee or die. that tells you what that bum is made of. I have read most of the other books having to do with the whole sordid affair and this by far is the worst. save your money . I would be ashamed to call this bum my father. I would even change my name
__label__1 Pretty ridiculous.: I really, really do not understand why this video is so popular. The yoga/breathing portion is nice, (I have been doing yoga for six years), but the "dancing" was really more like flailing your arms around in circles. I enjoy many styles of dancing and just found this to be completely boring and uninspiring. The music was uninteresting and I found the many voice overs distracting, not relaxing. The meditation part reminded me of a sing along children's video. I consider myself a spiritual, open minded person, but this is just plain cheesy.
__label__1 don't buy it: Broke after 3 months. Took me hours to fill out replacement requests. It is just not worth it. I will never try this brand any more.
__label__1 moldy silicon eye pieces: I ordered 3 pairs of goggles so that I can alternate them between my double practices. It's been approximately 2 months since my purchase and 2 pairs already has mold in the silicon eye pieces.I make sure I rinse them and let them air dry after every use. I have been a competitive swimmer for last 14 years and I have used speedo for many years and never had mold problem before.I don't know if the quality of the goggles has gone down but I will be looking into different brands ofgoggles as soon as possible for I refuse to have mold so close to my eyes for such a long period of time.
__label__2 VERY HELPFUL AND NOT TOO HARD: This is a very good video for beginners. I was out of shape although not overweight. This video has the exercises to get me back on track. I have already used it once and can feel the difference.
__label__1 A Trailer Trash Christmas: I cannot begin to describe how dreadful this "Christmas" cd is. First of all, if you are looking for your standard Christmas songs, don't look here. Up tempo, thumping rhythms, r&b wannabes, you get the picture? Second, Ms. Aguilera's singing is simply atrocious. She tries to get as many syllables out of a word that she can, and she whines, wails, and screams in the process. I defy anyone to find any Christmas cheer or spirit in this music. And finally, I can think of only one other diva who could have probably done a worse job, and that is Christina's obvious idol Mariah Carey.
__label__1 Pure babble: Have you ever sat down to read a book, read a chapter-full of words, then realized you absorbed nothing? So you yell at the kids to quiet down or turn off the TV. You re-read the chapter, but the result is the same. The Violin is the literary equivalent of someone picking up a violin for the first time and running the bow across the strings aimlessly and incessantly. Pure babble. I have not read her other books because I find the vampire theme boring. I jumped at the opportunity to read The Violin. Getting to the end of the book was an empty chore, not a pleasure.
__label__2 A band that manages to do more than imitate its influences: Third album from this indie rock group from Champaign-Urbana, IL. While they owe debts to the great British shoegazer bands of the late 80s (Ride, Chapterhouse, Slowdive), they manage to not sound like any of them. That makes for a fresh-sounding record heavy on melody, featuring three siblings with male/female vocals.Sample "The Break", "Shields", "Bands 1" and "Do You Know What You Mean To Me" for the highlights of this album
__label__2 I Love the Last Unicorn!: Ever since I could remember, The Last Unicorn had lightened up my world into another. I first watched this movie around the age of 5. I still remember watching it in wonder and thinking how pretty the unicorn is. *Has always been thrilled about them* Now that i'm an adult, I still what the movie and highly recommend it to anyone who loves fastesies, drama, and romance.Watch it! I know you'll love it!
__label__1 Hate it - don't buy it: I ordered this item thinking I would never have to worry about having the right temp for the bottle. Well guess what - I keep using the regular cup of water as a warmer. This warmer suffers from several major flaws:1. Steam operation - you put the water in using the measuring cup and you never know how much water is enough. For more than 3 ounces of milk even the max amount used in the measuring cup is never enough2. The bottom of the steamer becomes brown from the tiny amounts of milk that supposedly leaks from the bottle during the warming - so each time you have to clean it out with a tough sponge3. Even if the bottle is not warm enough you cannot turn on the warmer - it has a time period to cool down - and in the meantime your baby goes ballistic.The bottom line is - don't buy it. Buy the simplest warmer available - from Avent for example
__label__1 Bad experience with old model TI-89: This is and old model, not the recent TI-89. The screen is not in good conditions and the graphics does not look clearlyI wish I could get back my money!
__label__1 This isn't OEM; this is POS.: This is not an "exact OEM fit", at least not for my Ford Bronco II it isn't. The orientation of the locator pins on the connectors is the mirror image of where they ought to be. I'm either going to have to butcher the Bronco's wiring connectors or return the kit. The latter seems more preferable to me.
__label__2 The Wizard: This is one of my favorite books of tidbits. Basically coach Wooden gives his ideas on life, hard work, sports and manners. Through different stories of his life and experiences.It really was a pleasure reading this book and I feel that the philosophy of coach wooden, based on hard work, trust, learning and being a good person is straight forward and a throw back to simpler values.
__label__1 Two defective products: This may be a good espresso maker but I will never know. My first one worked for a day or two before an indicator light stopped working. I returned it for an exchange and the second one did not work right out of the box. There was a dangerous steam leak that caused steam to billow out of the coffee holder. I tried to contact DeLonghi but they did not respond. So I sent the second one back and will never know whether I am just incredibly unlucky or they make a terrible product.
__label__1 Inferior Tale: This movie is basically a remake of a far superior film, "Searching for Bobby Fischer". A spelling bee replaces the chess tournament but the character dynamics are similar. Laurence Fishburne was in both films, taking the role of the stern teacher from Ben Kingsley in this feature. It is not nearly as endearing, or as well-directed, as "...Bobby Fischer"- see that one instead.
__label__1 Decent read: This book does what the others have mentioned; it covers all of the basics and is to the point. Other books detail locations much better but again the book is not designed to be in depth. He references those books like Hurricane Treasure. My only worry was when I got to the part about detecting the Treasure Coast at high tide looking for treasure. I have talked to many people and done my research and nowhere else have I read to detect the high tide and chase the waves back in. He then goes on to mention to be cautious when waves are high and that it's fun detecting wet sand when it's not windy. Metal detectors LOVE high winds including nor'easters and hurricanes for the best chance at finding treasure and providing the cuts he had just finished mentioning. You can't love cuts and hate the winds that provide them... Maybe he got a bad reference here or maybe he is right, you decide.
__label__2 Bo Knows: A nicely recorded show. It captures the excitement of his concerts. It also has 3 bonus songs from the 60's with Muddy Waters and Buddy Guy.. If you are a Diddley fan buy it.
__label__2 Good product: Package was received quickly and in good condition. My son loves this piano and I was happy to get it at the best price.
__label__2 EXCELLENT!!!: This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn of TRUTH regarding the bomb. Newman does and excellent job of very clearly explaining the FACTS on this very complicated & controversial chapter of history.I'd like to quote one of the other reviewers of this book: "Part of the answer is no doubt domestic American politics. Having maneuvered the Japanese into the "sneak attack" against Pearl Harbor and having churned out viciously racist propaganda portraying the Japanese as a subhuman demon breed, the American government could hardly turn around and admit that the whole affair had merely been a sordid struggle over the boundaries of imperial spheres of influence."What and incredible load of garbage to imply that the U.S. "maneuvered" the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor. I'm speechless. Obviously, David Miller is a clouded revisionist and you can't take his review seriously.
__label__1 What the hell are they trying to say?: The question here isn't "what are this band's influences ?", but "what is this band under the influence of ?" This CD left me confused & disoriented. It seems to be a bunch of people using folk instruments to create "humorous" songs about death. Death isn't funny. Clowns are funny. Dead clowns aren't funny. Live clowns are funny. Clowns are funny. "Daddy's been arrested for a crime I can't pronounce". What does that mean? There's a song on here about the Black Dahlia murder - that's just wrong. THESE PEOPLE DON'T NEED AN AUDIENCE - THEY NEED HELP!!!
__label__1 good and bad: A relatively interesting story, but I must admit the initial chapter or 2 is so profanity laden that my wife has told me that this book must leave the house after I finish. Fortunately the language does improve considerably later in the book. I am surely in the minority, but I don't see why authors have to remind us that some junior high/high school kids curse. In this case "realism" tries to overshadow the literary benefits.
__label__2 Great for the season!: Great movie, great acting and at the end the feeling of "want more". image not fully HD but, as a rental, good enough!
__label__1 BUYER BEWARE: This is one of the worst games ever. Don't waste your money. Avoid it, don't even waste your money to rent it. It really is that bad.
__label__2 Every Crooked Nanny Book: I love all this author's books! The Callahn Garrity series is one of my favorites as far as mysteries go. I love the characters, especially those working for her at her House Mouse cleaning business!
__label__1 Sexist Garbage - Gender Biased Drivel: Good grief -- the title alone is reason enough to pass this one up. By the way, men collect dolls (and I don't mean action figures) too.100% trashy psychobabble with no substance.
__label__1 I do my research, but do YOU, Mr. Moore?: We watched this, ahem, "documentary" in one of my college courses. It was the first Michael Moore film I'd ever seen, and I've had a firm dislike of the man ever since. The way he cut scenes and organized the whole movie, it had the feel of the propaganda films made in Nazi Germany. It was ridiculous, absurd, and sometimes downright insulting. He threw out facts that were completely false, or sometimes just implied something that had absolutely no basis in reality. What I couldn't disprove with knowledge I had off the top of my head, I was able to dismiss with 30 seconds of research in my dorm room. I suppose it's America, and everyone has the right to release propaganda full of lies, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy it.
__label__2 The thrill of discovery: This is the story of the search for the structure of DNA, told by the one who (with Francis Crick) discovered it. But it's far more than that. It is also the story of a young man who tries to find his way in the world of science. The book is very well written, in a charming informal style. However, this is a highly personal account, and should not be considered as the objective truth about the subject. Especially the fans of Rosalind Franklin will testify this. Nevertheless, I recommend this book if you want to savour the thrill of scientific discovery.
__label__1 This movie should get the gong: This adaptation of an "unauthorized biography" of the man who single-handedly numbed more brains in the 1970s than anyone else is barely worth the time to watch it. The only positive thing I can say is that is (if you're a child of the early 60's and 70's) it brings back memories (The Unknown Comic? Gene, Gene the Dancing Machine?).
__label__2 Useful item: Purchased this product primarily for the IR receiver to use with universal remote. Given that Sony was arrogant enough to use a completely incompatible system for receiving signals, this item makes a nice work-around for people who actually want to use the PS3 in their home theater. Doesn't hurt that it is so affordable either.I paired this with the Logitech Harmony One remote. The Blu-Wave is already in the Logitech database, so programming the remote to work with the IR receiver was a cinch. Works like a charm.Only complaint (aside from having to buy this in the first place) is that you cant use it for power on/off, but this is a Sony problem, not a problem with the remote.I would recommend this product as an option for anyone wanting to control their PS3 with a universal remote.
__label__2 One for meat, one for cookies...: First used this to roast a turkey. Clean up of the pan was a breeze--and the drippings were superb!--but I had to wash the mat multiple times to get rid of (most of) the turkey smell, which still faintly lingers despite various cleaners and serious degreasers. Glad I bought two of them; one will be dedicated to meats, the other to cookies.
__label__2 Fantastic!: This is a text book example of what Theodore Roosevelt wanted when he asked Historians to write more illistrative, and engaging dialoge, not just boring bland historical fact. The author so impressed me that upon completion of his book I phoned him to give thanks. We talked for 20 or 30 minutes. He seems to be a good guy, and is a great historical writer!
__label__2 The Faces of Gettysburg-Awesome!: This is a wonderful book that originated from the idea of the Wall of Faces at the Gettysburg Visitors Center. The Gettysburg Nat. Mil. Park Library has received over 500 images donated from families and private collectors. This book(album) contains 200 of these images. Some of the images arrive with a bit of history or family lore. The book is divided into three parts: July 1, July 2, and July 3. The images are arranged into alphabetical order and display the soldiers name, rank, unit, age(some)and the final result of the individual)survived,killed,wounded or captured.) Most of the images show amazing detail and I enjoyed studying the uniforms, weapons and gear that the soldiers actually carried onto the battlefield. Also on page 52 is my distant cousin,Capt.Charles A. Phillips from Salem, MA. who suvived to become an attorney after the war.
__label__2 good product: it works well. So far I only cooked a roast beef and some lamb and they both were very tender and tasty. The only negative thing is the recipe book, which is too small: I needed to figure out by myself how to cook my stuff.
__label__2 Jazz Essentials 101: This music will make you want to drive straight to New Orleans and groove to the dixieland sounds that are the heart of all things Jazz! This is not Louis later "What A Wonderful World" Jazz/Pop. This is for serious Jazz listners only. But if your like me you just won't be able to take it out of your disc player. If you like this I recommend Bix Beiderbecke and Jelly Roll Morton.
__label__1 see no. 3: I wish I could review it but I could not even get started. First, I want to get a copy of this video but don't have the slightest idea what songs and how many songs there are. Is there a way to have the track listing available?Thanks.
__label__1 If you ever find yourself trapped on a plane: you might just find yourself watching this. It was neither good nor bad. It's one of those movies that you won't feel you missed anything if you don't see it. Charlize Theron is an extremely talented actress, but I'd rather see her in interesting roles like in The Devil's Advocate. Keanu Reeves is still just another pretty face. This movie is not especially original (see: Love Story and Autumn in New York) nor exceptionally well acted, although Chaz (downstairs neighbor) and the kid whose name escapes me are great characters. The plane landed before I could see the end, and I dozed off somewhere in the middle, but I really don't think I missed anything. If you're looking for a tear jerker, rent Legends of the Fall or Last of the Mohicans. The stories are much more interesting and at least Brad Pitt and Daniel Day Lewis are pretty boys with acting talent.
__label__1 Why have to be cheap?: I've just read this book, and well.... has good ideas, but the bottom line is: become cheap. Why acumulate wealth and live cheap? Not much sense to me. Becoming wealthy for me is becoming wealthy in all aspects of life, not just economically. One of the teachings of this book was that millionaires ride american made cars, and most of them not luxurious ones. For me, that is a clear example of being cheap.There is nothing like a well made european car.
__label__2 Delivers rich notes, despite size and price: I am a beginner and this harmonica works great for me!It has very rich notes even though it is quite small and is only a few dollars.It comes with a two-peice, hard plastic case and basic instructions showing how to hold it and play the notes. You can also find free tips and instructions on the internet telling how to play and care for your harmonica.I highly reccomend it to anyone who wants to try out the harmonica.
__label__2 Excelente Disco: Muy buen disco, tenía tiempo escuchando a Fito y, a pesar de haber bajado todos sus discos a mi ipod, no había tenido la oportunidad de comprar ninguno de sus discos en estudio. Este es el primero y la verdad es que está muy bueno. Lo recomiendo.
__label__1 fluff: I was disappointed. Had read some good reviews, picked it for a book club. It was unanimously disregarded as shallow writing. I admit, I was taken in by the title much like I was with that garbage "Jane Austen Book Club". That book was a disgrace to Austen's name!
__label__2 Fine Camara: -This camara picture quality is Nice, and depend on user purpose. My gf is kinda satify with it.-Function is easy to use.-Battery life is so so.-Battery charger design is not convenience. You have the put the battery into the batter charger. recommand to get a cradle charger, but extra cost. It should sell with cradle charger.
__label__1 Book with many mistakes and poor topics: I have been looking for a good introductory reference in Mixed-Signal testing so I can recommend it to the entery level test engineers and co-ops. I totally agree with the previos reader, I am very disappointed. In contrary, I recommend " An Introduction to Mixed-Signal IC test and Measurement" by Mark Burns and Gordon W. Roberts and admire their contribution in their bood to the field of semiconductor testing.A senior Product/Test Engineer
__label__1 Lame Beyond Belief: A pretty good cast labors in vain to save this lame film. Badly written and directed, the film is so busy telling me that it is a terribly important film about racism, but it never really gets around to being a terribly important film about racism. It moves from one easily predicted big scene to another, giving the actors lots of Big Scenes where they can scream at each other but not much else.The film finally sinks under its own Self-Importance. Avoid it.
__label__2 Jack Jones Simply The Best!!!!: A superb album from Jack Jones and his days at RCA records. Saw him in concert in the UK twice this year....the man is the best singer on the planet!!!!!!!! This album from Japan demonstrates all the skills this superb singer has.
__label__1 very bad phones-- very bad !: The $50 price , which is $100 discount , should provide all one needs to know about this poor product. Bad fit make for uncomfortable wear and the hum introduced with the noise cancelling turned on is a joke. What noise canceling? It's noise making !! Do not buy this terribly designed unit at any price..........
__label__2 High Probability Selling: I've been "selling" for about 6 years. I was even trained in "how to train people to sell." I have, since reading this book, changed my philosophy about selling. This book made me realize that my time is just as important as my client's time, and in some cases, more important than my prospect's time. It made me re-evaluate my product and boosted my confidence in it ten fold. I have increased my closing ratio from 1/10 to 2/3, and I've got a lot more free time. Read this book and you will see how. Some of the situations probably should not be practiced verbatum. Use your best judgment. Overall it is a welcome eye-opener!
__label__2 I love it: I heard Higher Love on the radio a few months back and something about the music just hit home and I had to find out who it was by. As soon as I found out the artist was steve winwood I bought the CD the next day and can't stop playing the song Higher Love though the rest of the songs are good too. It's one of the best songs ever, it's too beautiful for words.
__label__1 The book was ok: I happpened to come across this book at a thrift store for $0.50. I did learn a bit from it but it was hard to grasp what it was saying. Didn't actually finish the book. It covered some topics well but covered others pretty weak. Didn'y explain the example programs clearly all the time. Does have some good info. Didn't explain clearly where to compile the programs and where to save the examples. Had to figure that part out with some further internet reasearch. Several of the examples had errors when compiled (I redviewed the example in the book with what i typed in the computer line by line and still there were errors when compiled. Was able to fix and modify a few of them.) My overall recommendation is to find a different book to learn from.
__label__2 Best Dress Ever!: I bought this item on a Wed. and it was at my house on a Saturday. I needed a white gown for my sorority cotillion. And I was the talk of the town. I would recommend this dress to anyone. And forget about buying a size bigger. Sizes are accurate.And for the price you def can't complain. Just be sure to get it steamed, the dress comes pretty wrinkled from packaging.
__label__2 Cary Grant movie DVD: This is one of my all time favorite movies. I think Cary Grant is at his best in this, his last movie. He always cracks me up. The movie is in widescreen and the colors and sound are clear and rich. It is well worth the money.
__label__1 IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GOOD KNITTING BOOK KEEP LOOKING: This book is okay but if you are looking for a good how to knit or reference book I highly recommend: The Knitters's Companion or Vogue Knitting The Ultimate Reference
__label__2 Episode List: Episode 1: Ozzie takes care of robin's eggsEpisode 2: Harriet helps David get a girl who only dates college boys.Episode 3: Rick and Kris set Wally up with the Prom QueenEpisode 4: June becomes David's secretary
__label__2 5 Stars Fun with 3 Stars Graphics: But don't let that stop you from buying it. I have the Mac version and it's absolutely fun. It's one of those games that once you've start you cannot put down. For all ages.
__label__2 Works fine: Works fine, just don't ever leave it out of water, it will over heat quick. I bought two and have one in the truck and one at work.
__label__2 It Made Me Cry......: This is the best book I have read in my life,it was sweet,sad,touching,adventurous,invigorating,and it made me laugh,it made me cry,it made me woory,and it made me hope.....Like Tobias said:"Be happy for me,and all who fly free..."That is the ultimate statment,just think about it....It will make you wonder,dream,worry,laugh,cry,and it will make you fly free...................
__label__1 SNORE....this is an Iris Johansen book???: I love everything Iris Johansen writes or I guess I should say loved.....everything she wrote before this one. It was all I could do to finish it. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is not up to her usual par and also very convoluted. I would recommend any other book by her but if you just have to read this buy it used or get it from the library. Hopefully her next one will be as good as her previous books.
__label__1 Good idea but: Good idea but, will not work with windows 8 and i dont know if it will work on line at all. I could not get the soft ware for windows 7. the scale work good if that is all you need
__label__2 Brilliant followup to Stella Marni: This book is hard to review without giving out the secrets of Assignment:Stella Marni. It's a direct followup to that book when a Communist hitman is sent after Sam Durell in revenge for the Marni case. He also has a second target and Sam is forced into a race to Hungary when it's found target #2 has flown home.To make matters worse, Sam's boss has also disappeared behind the Iron Curtain.Good Cold War espionage.
__label__2 Characters you can't stop thinking about: I read Where the Heart Is and liked it so much I quickly ordered this book from the same author. I'm usually disappointed with the 2nd book, feeling they never match up to the first one-- but this one truly did. I really enjoyed the characters in this book-- they are in many ways typical of all of us, in search of a place to belong. But also distinct by their own rights. I found myself thinking about them between times in reading and was always anxious to pick up where I left off and find what had happened next. A highly satisfactory read-- I strongly recommend it. The author had no reason to doubt herselt, as she talks about in the end!
__label__1 another reason not to buy official hint books: Just like all "official" hint books, this one has no real help. The only remotely useful thing is the campaign walkthrus. The unit info is basically what you get in the StarCraft Manual. Pick up the Multiplayer guide instead; the unit tips are useful in Single-player as well, and hop on the net for some walkthroughs. Generally a bad purchase.
__label__2 Hysterically funny: I can bot believe she would admit to these things let alone publish them in a book. That's confidence. I laughed out loud several times and had my hand over my mouth for a few in disbelief.
__label__2 Heavier then the Loads: I bought this when it came out and I just listened to it the other day. I still think this album is really good. It is raw and has it's mistakes and that they were going for. This album comes with a dvd of the whole album performed live in the studio with at the time there new bassist. This album isn't as bad as everybody has said.
__label__1 Kindle Price is Too High: It is ridiculous that the Kindle edition of this book costs 24% more than the hardcover version. Amazon says the price is set by the publisher, but I am confident that Amazon could use it's significant bargaining power to change that if they wanted to.
__label__1 Everything is so superficial!: This book deals about everything but bioinformatics. You need to know far more biology than computing to do this. Just fire up the biology workbench ... with the biology student workbench ... and see! These are free web sites sand tools so most of the material in this book is irrelevant.
__label__1 Olympus FL-20 Electronic: It really does juat a little bit better than the on board and adds weight to the camera. I really do not think it is a great buy
__label__1 Boring: You know a movie is boring when you check your watch, half expecting to be half an hour closer to the end of the movie, and it's really been five minutes. The most enjoyable thing I could see was watching Al Pacino's forehead...you don't even need the DVD for this. Watch him as he talks for long periods of time with wrinkles in his forehead that don't move one bit...watch his eyebrows raised from plastic surgery. Truly amazing. I was expecting much more than an A to B to C to D movie where you can see the ending coming from a mile away. This was the guy that did Memento...hopefully, his next one will be better.
__label__1 Awful movie: Everything about his movie is crap. It's supposed to be funny but it's not, the story is idiotic and has been told a million times before in other movies, the acting is awful, and the movie has been edited like an MTV music video.Shaun of the dead was average but this is really bad!!!
__label__2 Pricey but works well: Don't think you'll be catching bugs right away,it takes bugs a few days to find this unit,but once they do,lookout.I found to help them find this unit I put a piece of paper behind the unit to help reflect light.
__label__1 Informative - yet dangerous: While the information contained in Marilu Henner's book coincides with tips and facts learned from nutrionists, alot of her recipes contain the use of pine nuts/peanuts. While of course, it's all to taste and preference, she does not show any kind of warning or disclaimer to the ill-fated allergic reaction one might have to nuts. More and more people, especially children, are discovering an allergy to nuts in the form of anaphylatic shock. The problem is one isn't aware of the allergy until a reaction is caused. As I learned in a lesson that almost cost me my life a few years back, I wasn't aware of my allergy to pine nuts until a meal containing them was ingested. Even the back of a bag of plain M&M's chocolate shows a statement pertaining to the fact that there "may be trace elements of peanut". Ms. Henner should have done the same in her book.
__label__2 Animorphs are the best: i have not seen it but i have seen one of the episodes on it and i will own it when iknow where to get it
__label__2 Just listen: This is one of the best works of Leon Gieco. He was able to blend argentine rock with folcklore and deep writings. It's one of those few discs in which every song goes to your heart.
__label__2 Amazing Voice: I have been a Josh Groban fan since his appearance on Ally McBeal. Unlike other artist, Josh's cd stays in my car and room for looooonnnnngggg periods of time. When I turn the cd player on the first few notes of Alla Luce Del Sole lift my spirits. Even my mother (the same women who can't understand my love of Billy Gilman's music) likes Josh Groban. His voice is soothing and the music on the cd is well written. The fact that most of the songs are in Italian will throw you off in the beginning but after awhile you'll find yourself singing along. This is a great cd!
__label__1 propaganda: what a disappointment. how do you say Zionist, fundamentalist, Illuminati? this is such a sell job. a waste of rental money unless you buy into this stuff in advance. after seeing what greed has done to this country why would we want to have the worlds funds controlled by a single government and a single religion?
__label__1 Uneasy: None of the information given in this book is documented with footnotes. There are some general attributes given for each chapter at the end of the book. It just makes me uneasy that the material does not come with adequate sources.Especially after one glaring error is to be found throughout the description of the religious clashes between the Scots and the English.The author refers to the Church of England as being the Episcopal Church. It is not. That would be the Anglican Church as opposed to the Episcopal Church or religion in the U.S. The Anglican Church became the Episcopal Church,in this country, after the Revolutionary War. The English monarchy is the head of the Church of England and we fought that deadly war to found our country's independence from the English monarchy.I found that I couldn't really finish this book because of my doubts.
__label__2 Absolutely Fantastic!!: I bought this album back in 1996, on the strength of the Stone Roses soundalike single 'Slight Return'.I expected an album of similar tunes, but I was wrong! Wrongly accused by the music press of being Stone Roses wannabies, The Bluetones have made an album of their OWN music. Sure, it's not groundbreaking - how many first albums are? But it has ensured that The Bluetones have a strong and loyal fanbase which ensured the success of their second album (Return to The Last Chance Saloon).'Expecting to Fly' is the kind of album you can listen to in full over and over again. Standout tracks are 'Slight Return', 'The Fountainhead', 'A Parting Gesture' and 'Cut Some Rug'.This album stands alone as a classic of the nineties. But don't be put off by the 'Britpop' label. This label was a term invented by the music press to encompass bands like Oasis, Blur and Pulp, which are bands with almost nothing in common.Buy it. Now!!!
__label__2 Terrifying Reality: This is a book that should (but won't be) read by every adult American. It presents in clear, readible text the nature of the threat that our nation faces. It then sets forth the 10 steps that America must take if we are to prevail. We ARE in World War III and have been for over 20 years, but most Americans are not aware of it. If we don't wake up soon it is going to be too late and we will have lost our nation and our freedom. Read this book and WAKE UP AMERICA!! PLEASE, if you don't have this book, get it, read it and pass it's ideas on. It's vital. Herman Son - A retired warrior.
__label__2 very good deal: i bought the item from Battery King, the battery is 720mAh not 680mAh and the Battery model is DP-S004 not any of the mentioned model in the item description CGA-S001E, it work with the camera and the charger
__label__1 setting up lamp: At the moment, don't buy this book. The reason: what is otherwise an excellent book cannot be followed, because the essential steps it takes you through require resources that are not available - ie. the web resources no longer exist. Time is money, and after spending another long day yesterday, running into one dead end after another, one failed work around after another, this book has cost me lots, and I've not achieved anywhere near Setting Up Lamp. The authors/publisher could correct this easily enough, by providing the info on their website. If these issues are corrected, the book is likely to rate differently. Until that time, invest elsewhere.
__label__2 Usher improves every time, especially on this album: The album 8701 is very good. I especially like "U Don't Have to Call." The track is very catchy and upbeat. It would be a perfect dance track for the club. I also like "I Don't Know" featuring Puff Daddy. The track is also catchy in nature and also has an upbeat tone. He balances the upbeat tracks with the slower, much more sensual tracks for the ladies. I wish he could have used "Pop Ya Collar." That would have made it off the hook!
__label__1 Good picture horrible company: The picture on the 50" plasma is good, the company support is awful. I purchased the set and it had a white powder between the screens. I have made numerous phone calls and have gotten no response from either the seller or Zenith. I purchased a Zenith dvd/vcr combo player at the same time and the dvd quit working 60 days after purchase.The Plasma runs very hot, the color and brightness are both good. If I were to buy today I would go with the LCD tv's and would not even consider a Zenith product.
__label__1 this is liquid....& UNRETURNABLE .. trashed: When you look through the reviews all you see are the five star reviews on top- but it's the one and two star reviews that are actually helpful and TRUE. This "waxing" kit is cute, but it's LIQUID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. It's not watery liquid but it's liquid enough that when you apply it to your skin and place the cloth over it, the two things don't adhere to each other. Not to mention, unless you're a corpse your skin is warm and this thing is made mainly of sugar which liquefies even more on warm skin! At first I thought I just wasn't following the directions, but I read it, reread it, re-applied the wax over and over again, but this item is totally trash. How they have so many positive reviews I can't imagine, but it wouldn't be difficult to fake them. What a waste of ten dollars- such a scam.
__label__2 Zeffirelli steals this show: I don't share other's enthusiasm for MacNeil's Scarpia. He looks like a benevolent Grandpa! Now if you've ever seen Gobbi play this part you know what evil looks like! The star of the show is Franco Zeffirelli. I saw this production at Covent Garden and the sets are breathtaking, particularly of Act 1. The video conveys this very well indeed. Domingo is of course superb and Behrens is in fine voice. I'd be nervous about kissing a girl with those top teeth though! Her Vissi d'arte is lovely, but, unlike Domingo, she can't act for toffee. It's a great evening's entertainment and I recommend it.
__label__2 How about that.....: From a small boy with his highschool sweetheart on his hand at the Washington county fair to a patriotic performance dangling from a fire truck at the McDonald PA 4th fest to Big Ben and ESPN recognition. There is a certain national grasp awaiting to carry real country music lovers away to a time in which music was impressionable. PNH's talent and fortitude are the emblematic forces that will continue to drive this group to the top, yet remain grounded to the roots from which they have grown
__label__2 living legend: This album is good.... If you don't like it then you don't know real music...... Master P is the best at it......
__label__2 Leary is a buffoon.: You could say Leary was nothing but a clown, but that would be inaccurate. He was a government operative working with the CIA. Don't take my word for it you can find plenty of info yourselves. There is a reason the personality test for new CIA hires is called the Leary test. Hopefully this rat swine is rotting in hell somewhere.
__label__1 Pan Handles fell off after only 5 years: I have always loved these pans until the handle welds failed. Cuisinart wants me to mail them the pots and lids at my expense, they will determine who is at fault, then they will charge me to mail the pans back. Oh yeah, and they said that the lids are not under warranty - despite that there is the exact problem with the lid handle... so I have a stockpot with only one handle, and a lid for another pan with no handle and the company wants me to be out $40 in postage costs to determine if they are at fault.... I am kind of pissed, as I purchased this "quality" set to last my lifetime .
__label__1 Lead Me Not To Temptation, And Deliver Me From This Movie: Can't sleep?Then just watch this movie.While the implementation of the movie was good (the 3D technology, graphics, etc.), the storyline sucked. No really, it sucked ad nausea.Me and my entire family went to sleep during our first viewing of this movie in our 3D home theater.But we did notice something from the repeated theme throughout the movie before the last person awake went to sleep: that the Dog is the real hero! They should have named the movie after the mutt!! And he just "aint" good as Rin-Tin-Tin either.If there was a rating LESS than 1 STAR, I would rate it as 3-D:Dumb Storyline;Disillusioned Screenplay, and;Dissuaded from buying another Spielberg movie.Steve Spielberg, I just made a brown bag and placed your name on it. The bag has two eye holes so I can see out while cautiously--VERY CAUTIOUSLY--buying your next movie.Take Care,...GhillieMan
__label__2 Great Bible Teacher: I ordered three of these books. I love to hear Les Feldick teach. He is one of the best teachers (Pastor Richard Jordan, John Verstegen, Alex Kurz are others) that I have ever listened to. The Bible comes alive to me when I listen to Les and these men. I highly recommend this book. They compare scripture to scripture allowing the Bible to speak for itself.
__label__2 Early Cocker: Great, great CD. Had the vinyl in the 70's. Every song is great. This was the time when he used to have Leon Russel in his band. I saw Cocker in performance in Seattle in the early 70's. Complete with red, white and blue stripped pants with platform shoes. He was amazing. The is before that time. A real rockin/blues CD. You can't go wrong with this one.
__label__2 A Mislead Rainbow of Beauty: Although this album feels mislead, it is still a wonderful flower of dazzeling songs. "Heartbreaker" "Can't Take That Away" "Against All Odds" "Rainbow" and "Thank God I Found You" are the high points here. The songwriting and singing is as strong as ever; thus I recommend this album to all Mariah's fans.
__label__1 Please Don't Waste Your Money On This Video!: I'm not sure what the other reviewers were thinking when they reviewed this video, but they obviously left quality out of the picture. The "Secrets of Dim Mak" was obviously made with someone's personal camcorder by a very amateur videographer. The sound quality is so poor that the viewer will need to turn their volume all the way up just to understand what's being said. Random images are edited into the video and offer no significant contribution to the message. In demonstrating some of the moves, both Montaigue and his partner disappear from the screen, leaving the viewer even less knowledgeable about the impact of the moves.I don't doubt, in the least, that Erle Montaigue knows his stuff (I own his Dim Mak Encyclopaedia), but he should've invested more into the production of this video.
__label__2 Shania Up in Chicago DVD: A must buy for any fan. I was at this concert in Chicago's Grant Park and the DVD captures the energy of her live show. Shania is the best singer/songwriter around today and this DVD is a 2+ hour live show of 22 hit songs (many of which were deleted when this concert aired on TV). She is also backed by one of the best supporting bands in music. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.
__label__2 A Most Important Book!: I read Conversations with God and in Book 3, God states that he inspired this book. I bought it and couldn't put it down, it was so meaningful. Hartmann wisely avoids talking about political solutions and recommends that we change our world perspective, one of the most difficult things to do yet the most important place to start. Although the title seems negative, Hartmann ends it on an optimistic note.One of the most important books on saving the planet that you'll ever read. Share it with everyone you know or better yet buy more copies and give them to your family and friends.
__label__1 Look for other options: I would not recommend this product. We use our instant read thermometer about once a week and this model stopped working at about month 4. We were very careful to only wash the stem and the thermometer was never submerged in water. It was accurate when it was working, but if you want something with a little more stay-power, look for other alternatives.
__label__2 Moving Tale of Love Gone Awry: We can all relate to this story. The man or woman we are head over heels in love with turns out not to be who we think or want them to be but Valerie Clark takes it up 10 levels and keeps you on the edge of your couch. Man oh man. Hang on for the ride baby cause it'll be a good one!
__label__1 Dry, lifeless, scholary ignorant: A typical work of the many that arrogant scholars, without any meditative practice and experience are producing on Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. It is pitiful and ironic that ego-inflated western scholars, most of them from "reputed" universities and therefore totally committed to academic correctedness (which is totally anti-Tao) attempt to interpret works that were written in a hightened state of conscioussness by Tao-men that had turned their backs to the sterile intellectuality of the status quo of their days.Don't waste your money on books produced by the new "Taoist scholarship" mafia, that come up with fanciful rationalistic theories only to impress their collegues and justify their salaries.
__label__1 Dissatisfied customer.: My problem with this book is that after taking the diagnostic test it contains, I soon learned that it DOES NOT include a score conversion chart like the real LSAT contains. Without the score conversion chart it could more difficult for the test taker to gauge his/her improvement. Also buyer beware: it DOES NOT contain actual practice and test questions from previosly administered LSAT exams as do both the Princeton Review and Kaplan LSAT prep books. As a consumer this was not obvious to me. I was dissapointed in this product.

__label__1 Not the best Lennon around: I read somewhere that at some point, John had thought of asking Paul to appear on stage with him, since John was so nervous about this performance. Unfortunately, it shows. It reminds of Chuck Berry, how he hires any local band that knows a 12 bar progression and shows up on stage and starts playing. The band here sounds under rehearsed, and the CD sound quality is murky to say the least. The only thing that saves the show occasionally is John voice, but for the most part he is just not into it. 'Hound dog' and 'give peace a chance' are just exercises of self-indulgence that do not desearve a second listen. Also, after listening to some tracks of the other show Lennon performed at the Madison Square Garden, looks like Yoko chose the wrong show to release.
__label__1 Moronic - this guy has no clue as to what the "left's values" really are: It is American pop culture which continues the horrible trend in the United States of idolizing consumerism and placing materialistic goals and possessions in front of human beings and how they are treated individually and collectively. He would have us believe that bands like Nirvana communicate through their music some type of hippster leftist ideal (for kids). This coming from a music exec, an individual who on a daily basis worked in a business segment which regularly abuses the naivete of its consumers (teenagers), all in the name of making a buck (or rather, millions of them). It's disgusting. I'm not going to waste more time on this trash, I already feel violated after reading 2/3 of the book (at which point I admittedly gave up and moved on -- there's no way the last 1/3 was going to save it, I guarantee it).
__label__1 Blah: It was ok for a rental, but just ok. The movie seem disjointed and never really went anywhere in my opinion. I usually like Cusak films, but this one just didn't do it for me.
__label__1 What movie are you people watching?: This movie is boring!!!! Except for the last 10 minutes this movie is just people talking!!! And its not even interesting dialogue like Tarantino usually writes for his movies. I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. I even liked his story in Four Rooms, but this one is a total misfire. I was one of the lucky ones who got to experience the full Grindhouse movie in theaters and Tarantinos movie had people yawning and looking at there watches throughout. Very disappointing after Rodriguezs awesome Planet Terror and some hilarious faux trailers.I guess every movie maker has a misfire, and this is Tarantinos which I'm happy to say he corrected with his next film Inglorious Basterds!!!
__label__2 Good introduction, could have had more extensive footnotes, translation easy to read: I guess I enjoyed reading Xenophon's "The Persian Expedition" or "Anabasis". The book and Xenophon has been denigrated through the millennia for not being truthful or rigorous, but the book, nevertheless is interesting to read through to get a first hand account of mercenary life in 400 BC as well as a hint of life in Persian lands. On the other hand, the book has been read throughout the ages by school children and those learning Greek.The translation is very easy to read and the lengthy introduction spells out the shortcomings of the book: there are several other accounts of the Ten Thousand that do not offer the same account of events as Xenophon's.Regardless, if you are interested in antiquity, primary source material is limited, making books like this worth while. I'd also consider Robin Waterfield's translation which has much more extensive footnotes
__label__2 At First Sight: Im reading it now. Im not really a reader but this book is a page turner. It a great love story and it is holding my attention.
__label__2 Great copy of "Satanic rites...": To Me, the transfer of "Satinic rites..." is great. It seems to be really letterboxed. There is no hiss. The colors are vibrant. There are no artifacts. Compared to an Alpha copy I had this is a ten.Many people think this is a weak Hammer film. I disagree. It is very entertaining.
__label__2 Great Outfit: This is a great outfit, but the only thing that i would have to say is that the underwear is a little baggy. Other than the underwear the outfit is great.
__label__2 I love this book: Patricia Telesco will always be one of my favorite authors. Her non-pushy attitude and great sense of humour make the book worth the read even if you don't use other people's charms or spells. She's had a wide influence on the young pagan coven community, and this book just reaffirms that she's just as good for a solitary practitioner.
__label__2 Great toy that attracts kids of all ages: I bought this for my 3yr old nephew and he loved it! Even the older kids who were 6 and 7 enjoyed it. The only real complaint that I could give is it can be pretty fragile. But at the cheap price and guaranteed enjoyment kids will get out of it, I'll gladly buy him another if/when it breaks.
__label__2 awesome 80's metal album: This cd is very good. The riffs are decently fast and complex, while not making it overwhelming. The vocalist is very good. The soloing is pretty decent and complements the music. If you're sick of KoRn and Limp Bizcuit and are looking for something with talent, this album is for you. I would say that it is a cross between Peace Sells by Megadeth and Takin Over by Overkill. If you are thinking about getting this cd, get it. You will not regret it.
__label__1 Broke Out: I was so excited to start using this because of the wonderful reviews. I tried it the night I got it and I saw no difference. When I woke up the next morning, my face was sort of itchy. I also had red patches on my face too. I just ignored it because I thought it was something else. I used it again and once again, I saw no difference. One morning I opened my eyes to see my face filled with white heads! I haven't broken out in awhile and it was horrifying. I'm going to return this :( I'm so disappointed. I've never broken out from a product before.
__label__2 Season 3 Part 2: For reason instead of releasing TMNT Season 3 in one complete set, LionGates released it in four volumes (3-6). Probably because there were 47 episodes that aired during the 1989 season.The episodes on this single disc volume are:The Ninja Sword of Nowhere20,000 Leaks Under the SeaTake Me to Your LeaderFour MusketurtlesTurtles, Turtles EverywhereCowabunga ShredheadInvasion of the Turtle SnatchersCamera BuggedGreen with JealousyReturn of the FlyCasey JonesMutagen MonsterIn Volume 4 we finally get the introduction of Casey Jones, who was only in a handful of episodes, and Baxter Stockman returns.This is another great volume to own.
__label__1 Buzzing comes from the speakers and Samsung says it's normal?: I'm happy with everything about this TV except it has a loug buzzing noise that comes from the speakers all the time. It's not something that's soft, as it's quite annoying sitting 13' away from the TV. I've tried different stations, raising and lowering the volume and different component inputs, but it always buzzes. I called Samsung to see if something can be done, and they said it was normal for this TV to buzz. I guess this one is going back. Sure glad I didn't buy it online. . .
__label__2 34 oz Thermos: My husband loves his thermos'! He keeps one at the office and one at home so that he can have is cold water with him at all times and doesn't have to worry about forgetting to bring it with him. When he takes it in the car and the temp. is over 100 degrees outside (and higher in the closed up truck) his water is icy cold while the outside is very warm to the touch!We like them so much that we have purchased them for our sons on their birthdays! One son is a diver in CA and he takes his hot coffee with him in the a.m. One of his co-workers swipped some of his coffee in the afternoon and exclaimed to him about it burning is mouth! They couldn't get over how hot it was after so many hours!I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good thermos and the price is GREAT! (Was less expensive than some of the smaller ones.)
__label__2 A beautiful book...: Before I read this book, I never knew what to say when people asked me what my favorite book was. Now, I never have to think about it...this is definitely my favorite book. I liked it better than The Mists of Avalon, and that's high praise. If anyone ever wondered what Marion Zimmer Bradley might be like in a non-historical or -fantasy book, this is it. It is the same wonderful writing style applied to a more modern set of circumstances, a close-knit, Italian family of trapeeze artists in the 1940's. The characters are so vivid that I always forget that they are not real... I speak of them to friends as though they were real people, using their emotions to describe my own.PS - If you have enough self-control, don't read the back or the front of the book until after you've gotten at least two hundred pages in. I would give a lot for some of the things in that book to be a suprise to me, and I hate it that I threw away the chance.
__label__1 So disappointing...: This is nothing like Borat or Bruno. Sacha Baron Cohen should stick to what he's good at---unscripted comedies with shock factor. This movie was a complete bore. Not even Anna Faris could save it.
__label__1 I feel better now: After skimming a couple of other reviews, I was relieved to learn this was SEP's first book. She certainly improved after this. Then again, there was no way to go but up. Having read and enjoyed her stories, this one shocked me. I couldn't understand why anyone would write about such low-life characters; but 100 pages in without the first decent character, I knew for sure I had already read 50 pages too many. So far the title character hasn't done anything truly evil, but she's only 18 and is working pretty hard at seducing her father in front of her mother. I'd better shut it quick. Thank goodness I rented it instead of buying. I'm still confused as to who would want to identify with sluts and child molesters, but to each his own. I'm done with this one.
__label__2 A Month of Naughty Bedtime Stories: These stories are HOT! Each tush-tingling story will have you squirming with anticipation. A must for all the naughty boys and girls on your list.
__label__1 The Dangers of a First Person Novel: Novels written in the first person can be very affecting. In "Expendable", Festina Ramos was very effective in this role. Her complex personality, with pain and paranoia foremost, came across as believable because she was telling the story, and made the entire book compelling.In "Ascending", Oar is the first person narrator. And (excuse the pun) Oar is a bore. We have no reason to like her, or care about her at all. In fact, the tedium of reading her banal comments virtually destroyed any joy in what otherwise might have been an interesting story concept.The moral of the story: Only try the first person ploy if it's a person you would want to hang out with. I'd probably skip this book if I had it to do over again.
__label__2 A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK: Dramatizing a quintessentially literary ghost story for film is not easy, in fact, it is pretty well doomed to partial failure for those who have grown up with the Henry James masterpiece in print and in several movies that have based themselves upon it.This is quite successful in showing Brittan's music to good effect. I found it interesting, entertaining, well-sung well-acted, well-directed; however, I found it much too prosaic and realistic to evoke the air of mystery, of the unknown and unknowable, that an effective ghost story should possess.I have not seen any of the other versions available on DVD, but would guess that the average viewer cannot go wrong watching this if his objective is seeing Benjamin Brittan's opera rather than Henry Jame'sstory.
__label__2 Holes Review: Holes, a great book for everyone. Its a book that keeps you thinking. It's easy to understand and tells you what life can really be about. After finishing the book you will see how everything in the little details all connects and I think that is the best part of the book!
__label__1 Well, you get what you pay for........: I bought this knife a a birthday present for a friend, and couldn't bring myself to give it to him, it's so cheap. I bought it new and unused and it was rusted! The features that came with it were cheezy fakes that wouldn't save your life unless you had divine intervention on your side, and the sharpener only made scratches, despite using correct methods of sharpening. This is a great example of a product that will give you buyer's remorse.
__label__2 the changing face of punk: Spoken word is a hard sell. Improvised rock (that isn't noodly jam-band modal dippiness) is a hard sell. So imagine combining these two hard-sell genres into one. Nevermind that Mike Watt, George Hurley, Jack Brewer and Joe Baiza are West Coast punks of the highest order, the guys who wrote the book that most latter day ersatz punks crib their songs from.There is a deep pedigree at work here, winding its way from Black Flag's "The Process of Weeding Out" through Elliott Sharp's Bootstrappers and Stephen Perkins' earliest Banyan collaborations -- the staunch belief that cathartic self-expression can find a nexus (and thus a solace) with visual art, the written word, film, and life itself.Unknown Instructors is not beat poetry or coffee-shop moping, it is a near-violent, slow-boiling affirmation that art is life.Those resigned to tread musical water and bash out 1-5-4s about how they are so alienated are warned to steer clear.
__label__1 Watch out on the batteries you use.: Put a larger mA battery and it stop working after a few minutes of use. Save up and go brushless if you want to increase some speed or use better batteries with your Rc.
__label__2 This should have been nominated for best picture of 1996.: The nominees should have been Fargo, Breaking the Waves, English Patient, Jerry Maguire, and Secrets & Lies. Fargo should of won but this epic film was a close second. If your one of those people that is serious about movies you have to see this. It's emotionally wrenching and very harsh at times. But it's all worth it. The performance by Emily Watson earned a well deserved oscar nomination (Frances McDormand won for Fargo, a good choice but Watson was clearly better in a more difficult role). I also loved the documentary style cinematography. A real winner all around and a must see film.
__label__2 Great reference book: A good exercise book for beginner/intermediate level. However, some of the sentences are not very accurate (according to my Japanese wife). But all in all, a good book to have together with other reference books.
__label__2 The wonderful world of gloomcookie: I absolutely love gloomcookie! From the moment I accidently discovered the first book in a cartoon shop I was captivated. And although the artwork in the second volume is not as smashing as in the first, the story is so wonderfully fascinating and addictive it does not really matter much. The complexity AND simplicity of it is incredible.Highly recommended!
__label__1 More like Semi-Remarkable Battles: This title is ok to borrow from your local public library, but do not pay $25 for this. This is a 50 minute episode of the History Channel series The Most. While many of the battles and military commanders recounted here are intersting, apporximatley 1/3 are not and really do not belong with the others. Segments such as Carrier Pidgeons, the U.S. Camel Cavalry Corp and Roman Collesium Naval Contests are not even in the same league as the segments on The Jutland, Battle for Berlin and Alexander the Great and thus detract from the overall DVD.
__label__2 Worth The Wait: This compilation includes two of my favorite albums I purchased 30 years ago as a teenager. I don't think there's a bad track on either album with many of the songs favorites of mine until today. I'm sure many fans of early Motown have never heard these songs as neither album sold well at the time. I was thrilled to finally get remastered versions of two albums I wore out years ago.
__label__1 cheap quality: within 2 months of wearing them, the glue that holds the leather top to the sandle wore down and it's not too late to exchange them....better off buying rainbows
__label__1 OK...but not good: Alright i will start of with the positives, first off this is a dance mat for a ok price, it lights up when you push the arrows and it has an anti sliding foam on the bottom* (*this also helps not that much but does help a little bit). its probably better off to just get the first one. so this is worth the money if you want a lil less sliding and like lights on the top of the mat (the arrows and stuff do not i repeat do not light up.
__label__2 Phenomenal read: As an avid reader / consumer of JFK assassination literature my curiosity was piqued after reading the reviews of Bloody Treason - Noel Twyman's book on Amazon. I decided to 'splurge' on a hardcopy of the book after one reviewer commented that Noel's book was the most comprehensive read on the subject....I was not disappointed - so much so I decided that i couldn't wait to get back from holiday to keep reading the book and bought it again on Kindle.Buy this book.
__label__2 Great at any price: Have to admit I've spent way more money than I had to over the years trying and later selling various monitors but these guys have stayed. Great quality and more important very clear and pure sound.
__label__2 Welcome, Baby! Welcome, WINNER!: As a former teacher who loved this author's Dinner at the Panda Palace, I was delighted when I came across her new book, Welcome, Baby! Having taken leave from teaching to raise my own baby, I recommend this latest book highly!The poems encourage parent-and-baby play with poems to read (I sing them!) at bath time, diaper time, bed time. There are clapping games and lap time games. The book starts with babys arrival and goes on to milestones such as first words, first steps, first birthday and has concepts like numbers, letters, colors.This authors a Penelope Leach/Mother Goose combo! Take a look.Makes an awesome baby gift!WELCOME, BABY!Welcome, WINNER!!
__label__2 Train Game: If you or anyone you know is a fan of trains-either watching them, photographing them, video taping them or riding on them, then this video simulator is for you. You can either watch the train that you are controlling from the sidelines or be in the cab of the train handling the controls of it. There are several different trains in this simulation along with several different weathers conditions to work with. This simulator is fantastic.
__label__1 It's so funny that so many readers have such over reaction: 1. It's just a BOOK written by some people who have their own thoughts, normal or crazy, how could one say it represent a nation? a government? Do you have mental or psychological problem?2. If it is true that the Bible predicts the two World Wars, does this mean that the God is the one who should be blamed?3. There were(are) many crazy thoughts and personels in the US as well, do they also represent the whole nation and the government? obviously nonesense!4. If someone diliberately want to mislead public, it is very, very bad any dangerous!
__label__2 Worth the money: My wife left me and took all the furniture and the kids furniture so I needed some temporary replacements. My 3 children told me that these air beds are more comfortable than there original beds. Thanks for bailing me out of a bad situation.
__label__2 Had to return it.: I have had one of these Bluetooth headsets for years. I think this is my third one. This one, however, began to give me trouble after 2 months. I contacted the company, and they agreed to send me another one, even though the return date had expired. I really appreciated that.
__label__2 Excellent: I've been using this trimmer for 9 months, using it to cut my own hair. In general it does a good job. I don't get "professional" results - no one would think that I just came from a barber. But after cutting my hair, I just don't look like I need a haircut.The trimmer is relatively big, so it is not ideal for precision work, like around the ears or sideburns. I bought a smaller trimmer for that. But for simply cutting hair it's perfect. The vacuum really works, the trimmer hasn't clogged, and has probably saved me over 200 bucks, while making my life more convenient.If it busted tomorrow I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.
__label__1 bottom 10% level: Not all episodes of a series can be first rate. The plot of this program is at the bottom 10% of the inspector Morse episodes. It is totally unbelievable.
__label__1 Unwatchable due to editing: Maiden's subsequent video releases have been stellar but this one is horrible. Every now and then I put it in because I actually like the setlist, but can't take more than a few minutes because of the horrible editing. It feels like there's a new shot every second.
__label__1 Pictures on the website are misleading: Just received this item in the mail today and already I am not happy. This product i had ordered for my wife. Based on the pics, she has a pair that came from another company looking just like this. It looks like on the rear side it is supposed to be a string which that is what she likes for comfort, the pair i got today is a strap attached to stings. I am not a woman but that looks very uncomfortable. All in all i am not impressed with this product.
__label__2 Are there horses?: The horses on the children's socks are very clear, however one viewing the picture of the adult socks can not get a clear picture if horses are on the cuff of the sock. This is important if someone is looking specifically for a horse design. Thank you
__label__1 Rusting !: This was my first set of "nice" knives. I am SO disappointed ! Right away they began to rust and are continuing to do so, more and more. Even my cheap knives from Target don't rust. The positive comment I have about them is their sharpness is awesome. I wish I had investigated the quality before I bought these. I just assumed any Chicago Cutlery product would be great since the name is supposed to mean quality. Wish I had saved for something of better quality ....
__label__2 aviator shades: I know aviator shades are dark...these are REALLY DARK. They practically make the world disappear.Cannot wear them on most days... nice pouch that they come in.
__label__2 Interesting and insightful: Opens your eyes to those around you. Read it and watch others. Protect your family!
__label__1 avoid this light: Biggest piece of junk I have ever purchased (from Amazon or any other place). Right out of the box the light didn't work. It was something as simple as a burnt-out bulb, but the light requires a special bulb that cannot be purchased at any normal hardware store.
__label__1 Very disappointing book: The inaccuracies in this book were too numerous to count. What's more, very little practical information is given on good fish husbandry; instead, the author seems to focus more on "bettas for profit."At one point, Mr. Maurus remarks that bettas are short-lived, and as a result it is best "...not to get too attached." What kind of advice is this for serious pet owners?Very poor, other than the pictures. Otherwise I would have rated it a 0.
__label__2 Touching: This was an incredibly touching movie. Fassbender's performance was unremarkable and the story was very well designed to be extremely compelling.
__label__1 Great book: The reason this book got one star is because the print is too small and not easy to read. I bought it for a gift, but would not give it because it is too small of print. The contents is great. Also, it is a very small paperback.
__label__2 Great overview and confidence builder!: I'm pregnant with my first and was thinking about registering for the breastfeeding class at the hospital but thought I might as well check out this video first (it was available at my local library and therefore free!) -- what a great alternative!*Sheri is knowledgeable and entertaining. My husband enjoyed watching the video and seemed to be taking mental notes for when our baby comes.*The methods she recommends are presented clearly and matter-of-fact (although it's always a good idea to seek out your local professional help or lactation consultant if you're having problems).*Filming and presentation was pretty good -- if a little bit staged, but not enough to make it seem really cheesey.This video is totally worth watching and passing along to new moms. I'm not going to register for the brestfeeding class; I'll just rent the video again if I need a refresher course (and keep the breastfeeding book and La Leche League meeting schedule close at hand).
__label__2 This is my Family: The book This is my Family is about a young boy critter who explains his family to us. The book was a fun book and it taught little kids about families. I would recommend this book to anyone with a young child for a good bedtime story or a good book to enhance young children's reading skills. The book is funny and entertaining and a very well written book and I recommend reading all the Little Critter books, along with This is my Family.
__label__1 Nonsense: The stance of this book is in the tradition of those promoters of the imperialist tactic cloaked as the "Caucasian burden" that suggests that their presence Africa is a "civilizing" one.
__label__1 not working: After one successful printing it didn't work at all. My printer is HP deskjet 712C. This cable seemed to be recognized correctly at first but kept from being connected.
__label__1 Not worth the time or money: I decided to buy these because of the wrap around on the ears and on the reviews the product received. It does not feel comfortable on my ears and I have a small head. The mic is adjustable which is nice. From what I'm told, I sound good to those I am talking to. However the sound quality on these headphones are terrible compared to my Logitech headphones. I pretty much set up the headphones and used it for 15 minutes before tossing them to my boyfriend to use since he broke his mic. If you're looking for quality sounds for a good price, try Logitech.
__label__2 Dunlop Trigger Curved Guitar Capo: I love this capo. I like how it really does clamp down on the neck of the guitar without being so hard to unfasten. It hold the strings down very well, and it isn't so cumbersome and heavy when I stand up and play.
__label__1 not great: This is not great. It is cheap, looks cheap, and works cheap. The noise level from it fluctuates from nice to too loud and would wake anyone up. The lights in it are either off or on. And when on they change colors...really fast! Nothing soothing about that at all. To think that I had to buy a usb plug adapter to use in the wall outlet for this junk makes me sad. I guess I will have to find something else for my son's room to use as a night light.Unfortunately, not a great buy.
__label__2 bow down tgo somebody that's greater than you: ice cube, mack 10, and wc representing the west oast baby!
__label__1 Time Machine, not one of my favorites.......: The part in the book I didnt like was when Weena got lost and the Time Traveler didnt seem to care. The part in the book that I liked was when the Time Traveler found his Time Machine and escaped the Morlocks.The diffrent settings were the Time Travelers house, the Eloi's world and the Morlocks, and when he lands on the beach where the sun dies.The problem was tha the lost his Time Machine when he got trapped in the Eloi's world. The problem gets resolved when he fights the Morlocks away and steals the Time Machine back. -H.R.
__label__2 Diverse styles, important themes - a great anthology.: Having only just started reading gay fiction, and being possessed of an incredibly short attention span, I found this anthology a good read. The writing styles throughout are diverse, as are the themes of the stories. You're sure to find a favorite in the group.Again, I have just started reading gay fiction, so I found the Afterword particularly helpful, as the editor offers a reading list of 10 important works of gay fiction. He also discusses the corporate "dumbing down" of contemporary gay culture, and explains clearly the importance of supporting gay authors and bookstores. I can't wait to head to my local gay bookstore (not online) to buy some of the suggested titles.
__label__1 DREADFUL SOFT PORN: This is a dreadful soft porn movie masquerading as "art" with dreadful acting by an unattractive cast, corny dialogue and filler scenes that could cure insomnia. It is truly unwatchable as a movie and unwatchable as porn!
__label__1 Coleman battery operated tent fan: Product does not come with instructions as to how to open the battery section. There is an open/close wheel but nothing happens when I use it. I will have to call the company.
__label__1 Horrible!: This is horrible! The sound sounds like a 1/32 and you should not buy this junk. The pegs keep on slipping and NEVER stays in tune for than 10 minutes. I am returning this to amazon.
__label__1 Panasonic phone: Bought four and all of them make a static sound whenever we use the speaker. Contacted Panasonic just could not figure out and they did not want to do anything as it was technically out of warranty in just a few months. Just got stuck now and will not recommend this product at all.
__label__1 Stay away!: Buy one of their products once and the will hound with special offer E-mails twice a day for the rest of your life! Unsubscribing from their mailing list does no good, the SPAM just keeps coming!
__label__1 won't stay put - Unuseable: the clip part does not fit well and the thin plastic its made of transmits all the handlebar vibration to the mirror rendering it useless!
__label__1 One star for one track!: Chant to the sun, was the opening soundtrack for the late great WNEW 102.7 FM New York city disc jockey - Alison Steele the night bird.
__label__2 Good Set-Up: I enjoyed Clover 1 very much, but I feel I must point out that this part of Clover is little more of set-up for the plot. The main fireworks for the characters takes place in Clover 2, which picks up literally from where this book ends. For best reading, be sure to have both 1 and 2 for the whole story. 1 sets the plots up, and 2 rams it home.
__label__2 First novel & not the last!: Good effort by Mr. Kingsley. It's all here. Legal twists, mysterious characters and a generous dose of romance. Kept me reading past my bedtime!
__label__1 Turning into David Lee Roth?: I was disappointed with the new CD. It sounds like someone oraganized the recording,the songs and music and Bob Dylan just showed up. I LOVE Bob Dylan, but this was not the Bob I know. I miss the composer/musician/Philosopher Bob. This CD had early Jazz sounding remakes and bigband overtones that is turning him into a David Lee Roth showman. If this is the real Bob Dylan, he has really grown up.
__label__2 Porco Rosso -- Great Miyazaki film, though not his best.: The premise of this film sounded a little bizarre when I heard of it -- a WWI flying ace who's been turned into a pig? I was skeptical when I bought it, but I am a huge Miyazaki fan, so I thought I'd give it a chance. Turns out, it's every bit as fabulous and off-beat as his other films -- some really great animation sequences, and some truly funny lines. The ending (in my humble opinion) was a bit of a dud (a long narrative segment that leaves the fate of the hero ambiguous), so it's definitely not my favorite (compared to films like Mononoke and Spirited Away), but it's worth watching and owning.
__label__1 Raptors?: It is sooo lame! In the begining you see the raptors! You should not see the killers until at 30 minutes of the movie! It's just seeing people being alone then getting ripped apart! I stopped watching after 18 minutes. I figgered once you've seen one guy die you've seen the movie! People who have not seen jurassic park 1,2,and 3 seem to like this movie! Jurassic park is soooo much better! Rent it if you must see it!
__label__1 E500 Battery Drain and inconsistent focus: Do not buy this camera. Battery drain is fast even with rechargables. Regular AA batteries do not even work in mine. New batteries will not even power it up. I'm going to buy more of the most powerful rechargables and keep many nearby. My wife hates camera, will not use.Many times it loses its focus ability. You have to power down and back up again and cross fingers. When it works, it takes good pictures, but frustration level is high. Shutter lag is bad, you will miss the action. Stay away.
__label__1 avoid like the plauge: Recntly, I made the mistake of buying Money 2002. The problems started just after I installed it. When my computer booted from that point on, my anti virus software would not work at all, or, my boot would take literally 10 minutes.One good thing I do have to give microsoft credit for though is system restore on Win xp. Once I used that to remove Money, my problems starting up were solved.
__label__2 Great Performances Carry The Day: These concerti are not as splashy, colorful, and arresting as Vivaldi's top-drawer works. I was actually bored on first hearing. The second time around, the disc came alive for me. The performances are breathtaking, with many interpretative felicities. If you are someone who can enjoy less-than-first-rate music becaue of stellar performances, this recording will delight you. Actually, I did like the music a lot more on repeat hearing. Sound quality is superb. Timing is skimpy-don't tell me these guys couldn't have found additional filler from Vivaldi's 500-plus concerti.
__label__2 Typically Great Product from Men at Arms Series: This book is one of the typically great products available in the Men at Arms Series. It has excellent graphics and pictures, and each volume contains enough detailed information to be interesting, but not enought to overwhelm the military "hobbyist" reader. Each volume is short enough to be read in one sitting. To me, Men at Arms represents quality. I've never seen a bad one.
__label__2 Great book: Great story line. Loved the "Sci-Fi" aspect of the story. Wish it would've eneded differently though. Too many unanswered questions.
__label__2 30 Pack: At first I was skeptical about these, but my lab puppy went on them most of the time. After he grew a little older, he started chewing on them instead of relieving himself on them :-) They were indeed useful in house training our dog. I highly recommend them to anyone with young dogs.
__label__1 will temporarily lower your IQ: This has got to be the stupidest movie ever made. Please don't say "I didn't get the joke...." I got them, understood the punchline and didn't even crack a smile. I love comedies and the trailer for this film was so hilarious, I couldn't wait to see this film and paid full price the day it came out. It was all I could do to sit through this thing, faithfully expecting it to be a comedy as advertised. STUPID, STUPID, and more STUPID. I could see people at a party who were pretty snockered getting a kick out this movie now and then, but your senses must be sufficiently dulled by large amounts of alcohol or a severe head-trauma to find this amusing.Save your time & your money and flee from this foul stench of a film.
__label__1 Disappointing: I have read several of Dr. Weiss' books, which I found highly enlightening and inspiring. However, this CD was not nearly on the same level.My main complaint is that it was too short. I don't see how Dr. Weiss can expect anyone to have an in-depth experience when the CD does not put you into a trance long enough for any real results to happen. What I have had to do is create my own CD that allows more time. I could have done that from the beginning and not spent any money.Otherwise, it was a soothing CD that did relax me. If you are looking for a real regression experience, this is not the one. As someone else said, you would probably be better off seeing a therapist in person for a real session.
__label__2 Beautiful and Addicting!: I have played this CD almost continuously since I bought it last week. The mood is lighter than the Mirror Pool but the songs still have the trademark haunting, mystical quality that Lisa does so well. The James Bond song is really cool!
__label__1 Not Good for Crowded Areas - Hard to Control, Ball Travels VERY Fast: We found this toy very hard to control. The ball travels very far, and very fast. That can be a good thing, but among four guys who tried this today we just couldn't get a pass-and-throw rhythm down. Constantly missing targets and over-shooting our partners. Eventually we had to stop trying to catch the ball because it was rolling into (or scaring) peoples picnics nearby. Perhaps we were doing it wrong? It's like jai alai, right?
__label__1 Corinthian Leather?: Chrysler made up the term "Corinthian Leather" in the '70's. There's really no such thing. I heard it was actually all made in New Jersey.
__label__1 Save Your Money: This game is NO WHERE NEAR the caliber of NFL2K and NBA2K. I have had it for several days and here are just a few of my complaints: CANNOT CONTROL THE DEFENSE!, cheesy fan animations, Runners look like they are on a slip and slide, Annoying commentary, poor sound effects for croud and ball hitting the glove. CANNOT CONTROL THE DEFENSE!, hitting and throwing controls are sluggish, 680 foot homeruns (that is wonderful attempt at realism), among others. Did I mention you CAN'T CONTROL THE DEFENSE? This is the only game I have ever played where you can't control the defense. Great pitcher and hitter graphics, they just left out too many key elements to make fun. Hopefully ESPN Baseball Tonight will finally come out and be done a lot better. Save your money.
__label__2 Great movie with a great price: My kids love all the Barbie movies. This is a must have for the collection. It was much cheaper here then in the stores.
__label__2 Sharpie Review: The merchandise was very good. I was a bit dismayed at the shipping time (I took the free shipping) -- I had no idea that the norm was 3-4 weeks if one qualifies for and selects free shipping.
__label__1 Another Let's-Shoot-The-President!: After much urging by others, I decided to try Patterson. J&J is my first [and last] go. Life is too short to put up with another "less-than-ept" Columbo, a "let's-protect-the-kids" theme, yet another crotchety old stereotype grandma, and a to-become love interest who becomes conveniently "available". The "Dennis-the-Menace" subplot got in the way, the Jack-and-Jill sex was PG, and the author had no way of utilizing the sexual mutilation theme. Way to go, Patterson! Cha-Ching! Another pot-boiler!
__label__1 Hire a professional!: I'm in the middle of raking up all the thatch that was created using one of these blades. I am on day two of raking up this mess and looks like it will be possibly day three. Tried the lawn mower with bag, but it filled so fast it was too time consuiming emtying it al the time.Furthermore, the blade didn't reach deep enough into the thatch. So, after I rake up this mess, I get to do it all over again!.The spikes create alot of fluff - but I would say a good third of it is the grass it ripped up - basically the lawn got a very short hair cut and maybe half the thatch came up.Do yourself a favor - hire someone to do it!
__label__2 Pharaoh's son - a good read: I have read this book and enjoyed it immensely. It opens with a festival in the City of Memphis, Egypt during the Reign of Ramses II; while a parade is being formed a 40 ft statue falls on the crowd of revelers. The mystery begins with how the statue came to fall and moves through the why. The Royal family of Egypt and the Priesthood of the god Ptah become interwoven into the intrigue. I found the main characters well drawn and would not hesitate to recommend this book.
__label__2 Excelent product: Excelent product, fast delivery! It fullfills everything that one should expect when buyng from Amazon. No further comments, No need to write anything else
__label__2 Until I Own the Set, I'm Keeping the Rentals...: Great fun. Great animation. Imaginative and original. For grown-ups - By grown-ups, at long last!!! Made to be enjoyed over and over . . . and OVER! I can't think of ANYTHING to compare it to - "Yellow Submarine" has been mentioned, but, No. It's not "Yellow Submarine" - except in the sense that the music is by one band - the 'Pillows'- and is excellent. This collection is a masterpiece on every level, and is absolutely a "Must-Own". I wish it wasn't so pricey, tho it IS worth every penny!(I'll just hope that Santa brings it for Xmas! hint, hint)
__label__2 It's not the same old, but it's good.: If you look at AFI from the first 7" to Sing the Sorrow you can't honestly say they have been releasing the same style of music for 15 years. The initial work was very straightforward CA punk and the later albums, especially Sing the Sorrow, have taken a more orignal voice and added elements from hardcore, pop, gothmetalstuff, and the music era we all love to hate - the 80's. But c'mon, they are one of the hardest working bands in music today and this album is a testament to a very creative, orginal, and talented band. Does it sound like the music they were putting out when I was still in high school? NO. Is it good anyway. YES.Also, for all of the people so shocked at the "screaming" on this album...have you listenend to their best record Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes? Davey wrote the book on melodic screaming.
__label__1 Simplistic: The book has a very interesting title but the stories just don't live up to it. They wind around and around without going anywhere, they messages at the end of each story are just not interesting.
__label__1 Boot print and stains: When I read a couple other reviews about stains on this laptop bag, I never in a million years imagined I would get a product with stains.I just received it today, and the canvas has a boot print (yes, a boot print) and heavy dirt stains on the edges of the fabric. I can see the original color of the fabric on a 2" x 4" spot where something was obviously laying on the bag--while the rest of it collected dust.Who in their right mind would ship something in this condition? Obviously not someone who cares about quality or their customers.Otherwise, it's a fairly cute bag, but I can't get over a company that sends out flawed products--repeatedly, probably purposefully, just to get rid of them.
__label__2 Loved it!: Loved this book...this is the 1st in the series. I hardly ever read for fun and when I do it's hardly ever fiction, but this book kept my interest the whole way thru. It's similar to the TV show "the finder", but different bc Walter is an old man that was in Vietnam. However it's a great read.
__label__1 Don't Be Fooled!: They should name this product "Design Blunder for the Ages." The GPS portion of the Magellan 800 works well, a slight improvement over the 700 series.With the Magellan 800 Roadmate, you also get a MP3 player. But check this out, you can't play music and get directions at the same time. It is either... or. So if you're lost, you have to switch over to GPS and the music is gone, and if you want to listen to music, you select the song, then the screen goes blank and GPS dissapears. According to the tech guys at Magellan, it was designed that way! How dumb is that?So essentially you are paying an addition $200 - $300 over the Roadmate 700 for an expensive mp3 player that outweighs an ipod by almost a pound. Does this make sense to anyone? I am returning this product immediatly for a refund.
__label__2 Im still dancin'!: Okay guys.. buy this cd. It's stellar! COME ORIGIONAL is just as catchy (or maybe more) as thier hit DOWN. YAY 311!
__label__2 Not to be Watched Alone in the Dark!!!!: Not as gorey as I thought it would be, but the suspense was killing me!!!! Very well done, beautifully filmed, stellar preformances by Ewan McGregor and Nick Nolte. Scary, funny, and poignant...a must for every video collection!!!
__label__2 Perfect for an inexpensive life vest: The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is that the front has 2 peices of foam inside instead of just one so that's kind of strange but not really important. I like the vest
__label__2 Less of the loud accompanyment please!: Ofra's Haza's singing on this album is stunning, where we can hear her above the loud accompanyment. I just hope that with modern recording technology they will reissue her work with the background toned down so that we can enjoy the beautiful soaring voice. There was none like her. Whenever I hear Ofra's voice on a sound track I recognize it instantly. for my taste, it is the "dance club" rhythmic beat that it too loud. I prefer Kaddish and Slave Dream where the background music stays in the background.
__label__2 Hip 60s soundtrack tunes: Easy Tempo has done it again with another great compilation! Lots of great stuff here, loaded with Hammond B3, Electric & Fuzz Guitars, jazzy brass sections & wordless vocals. The recordings are nice and clear and clean. Very enjoyable, great for parties.
__label__1 Boring and dated: I've been wanting to watch this film for over 20 years, but sadly, like most other films of the era - The Longest Yard was flat for me. Some films don't age well and this was no exception. Everything seems hackneyed rather than real. Sure, I wasn't expecting "Any Given Sunday" but something a bit more compelling. I couldn't finish this, but maybe BR fans will have better luck..
__label__2 A MUST HAVE if you are on a budget!: I can't imagine planning our wedding without it. Even if you don't have a strict budget, this is a great book to have for reference. I've purchased 4 different books for planning our wedding and this is the one I read the most (the cover is completely misshapen). Its inspired me to do my own flowers to save money, and the information about the different bridal gown designers was more helpful than I would have imagined.
__label__1 one-draft dud: Even for escapist, nonsense, and formula, film is positively awful. This is why everyone in LA has written a script.
__label__2 EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING!: This book explains to you all the basic principles of geotechnical engineering step-by-step. It also includes excellents examples and exercises to help you to understand better each theme, but you shouldn't have problems..because it's so simple to understand.
__label__1 This game sucks!!!: Do not wast your money. the game is terrible, it looks really cool on the box but it isn't.
__label__1 What Intervention...: I read Part 1 which laid the background for the Intervention, so I eagerly read Part 2, but was very disappointed to find that the actual Intervention was only one line at the end of the book, basically saying "the space ships have come". I want to know how humans react to the coming of the aliens, but sadly we will not find out. At least the next book, "St. Jack the Bodiless", covers some events after the Invention when Earth was still under Simbari Proctorship.
__label__2 Busch Quartet: Beethoven String Quartets, Op. 59, Nos. 1 & 2: An excellent reissue by Biddulph of two of the greatest recordings the famed Busch Quartet made after relocating to the United States. These works were recorded in New York City in the early 1940s are are sonically amazing. They far surpass most of the work Columbia Masterworks was doing at the time, and, to my ear, are better than some of Columbia's other recordings of these artists.The performances, in my opinion, have never been surpassed, and rarely equalled. True classics of the gramophone. Sad that this group was not able, at the time, to record the third quartet of Op. 59, but we must be greatful for what we have!
__label__1 BEWARE : The quality control was completely flawed!: Absolutely pathetic that the company involved with pressing this rubbish now want you to believe it's your fault your blu ray disc is out of sync. Do the right thing. Issue a recall. Because the whole planet is experiencing this major issue with the release, and believe me, I've tried all the things you suggest and it's not me or by broadcast quality equipment. It's you and your flawed quality control process. Why would this not occur on every other music blu ray if it's indeed a user settings issue?
__label__1 Form Over Function: I've had at least 3 of these and they don't last. The motor burns out quickly. I'm an experience cook and know how to treat my equipment so I have concluded that this chopper and many other KitchenAid products are poor quality (gone are the days of the amazing Hobart motor!) packaged with a high-quality look that is deceiving. It took me awhile to catch on but I've finally learned my lesson. My KitchenAid days are over.
__label__1 Should have done her research: At one point in this disappointing work, it is mentioned that the heroine's father killed his brother and married the brother's widow, and that such marriages, while not illegal, were frowned upon. Five minutes' research could have told the author that marrying one's deceased sibling's spouse was absolutely illegal, so illegal, in fact, that not even a civil marriage could be performed, much less a religious ceremony.
__label__2 Good Read: It was a good read and I enjoyed it. im not sure as to what i should say I liked the book.
__label__1 Leaves out Project 2002 Server: I must humbly disagree with the other reviewers. It is important to point out that this book does not provide ANY information related to the Server product, which is the predominant reason people would move up to Project 2002. For example, go to the index and look up "Spooler error" and there won't be a single reference. Look up "Enterprise" as in resources and there won't be anything. This book is purely for Project 2002. Her style of writing is very nice so I wish that she would write a companion book on Project Server which really needs some troubleshooting guides right now!
__label__1 Ouch.: These glasses hurt to wear, don't fit properly over one's ears or nose, and badly interfere with vision. Not recommended for any costume whatsoever.
__label__1 Bad technical problems make DVD unusable: This DVD played ok for the first minute or two and then began to freeze up for long periods. I tried it in 3 DVD players with the same result. The content for the first minute or two that it worked was fine...but I was not able to see or hear the rest of the video making it unusable. Returned it but due to the poor quality of the DVD, I'm not going to re-order. Even the outside cover of the DVD looked cheap like someone had made a poor copy instead of a new, glossy cover. Strange.
__label__1 its so confuseing: This book is about a kid named marco whos mom is a safety freak she wont let him go outside so one day hes playing softball and he gets hit in the head with a baseball bat the next day he hwakes up and a boy named keith calls marco and says that he lives in marcos basement and marco has to take care of him forever as the book goes on you get more confused.
__label__1 Terrible!: Following the series our pleasantly plump former SEAL "collaborated" on with John Weisman, these latest forays into the fiction world are best left alone. Characters are weak, as is the dialgue, and the plot is virtually nonexistant. His new collaboration with DeFelice just does not have the same pizzaz!
__label__1 A big letdown and a big waste of money: I agree with everything the other reviewers have said so far. There is absolutely NOTHING that can be gained from reading this book, except for a few web addresses which can easily be found with a search engine. Save your time. Save your money. Save your disappointment. Do not buy this book.
__label__1 Sorry leftover of the Red Times: ... there surely can't be many of these people left. Maybe in England
__label__2 Inspirational: Easy reading and inspirational. Could be a life changer. Would recommend to anyone looking for answers in makes changes in your life.
__label__1 so poor quality: I bought the plates as additions for when we had a lot of company over for dinner. They chip very easily on the corners. I do not wash them in he dishwasher I simply wash by hand and almost all of them have chips on the corners. I do not recommend buying these.
__label__2 Excellent Teaching Tool: Hamilton's Mythology continues to make an excellent, approachable tool for teaching basic Greek/Roman mythology to students of any age. While the organization is a bit odd, the beauty of this anthology is the clarity of the writing, which makes it useful for both middle-school age students first exploring mythology and college-level researchers re-familiarizing themselves with specific events.
__label__1 liner bunches up when fingers are removed: The lining of these gloves comes out of the fingers when you remove your hand. When I tried to put them on again, it took me a couple of minutes to straighten everything out--NOT what I need when trying to get things done. Too bad, because the gloves are well-constructed and seemed like they'd be great. Donated after two wears.
__label__1 To many suds: We have soft water in our area and the dishwasher kept overflowing with suds from the Earth Friendly dishwasher gel, cut way back on the amount we put in and it still overflowed.I read about the different ways to cut back on suds, from using vinegar to cooking oil, but thought it was ridicules to have do this every time I wash dishes in the dishwasher.We have since switched over to Ecover dishwasher tablets and problem solved, and the dishes come out sparkling, clean & spotless.
__label__2 Pretty Awesome. . .: This DVD is cool. I'm mean way cool. I got into Rush about a year and a half ago. Sonce then, I've been a proud fan. This DVD is cool because a) they combine 2112, Xanadu and Working Man, to make what I call 21 Xanaman. b) they have all these funny little easter eggs and other stuff, like the Rush bobblehead super heroe thing. c)Cuz Neil still does those drum solos. The only con of thid DVD IS THEY DON'T DO FLY BY NIGHT! I love that song! i don't have on a CD either but fortuatly, i have itunes, so I bought from there. Problem solved. OK, overall, GET THIS DVD! And if anybody tells you that you'll regret getting this DVD, you should immediatley plug your ears and start sing Tom Sawyer as loud as you can. That is all. Goodbye.
__label__1 not what i expected: got the game.. no instructions.. knew how to play classic and painted but the other 3 I didnt have a clue. wouldnt go full screen on computer. other wise its ok...
__label__1 Don't buy this book.: The book's title is misleading. They should have take out the words "Practical" and "C++". It's very academic, and a few REAL C++ codes.This book is not for beginners, and not practical, not written with C++ in mind (or OO programming).The first impression I've got when I opened this book is that I thought I was reading someone's thesis.
__label__1 The dysfunctional family abroad: I read this book for a library book club I belong to. I can sum it up simply and easily. Two white racist alcoholics raise two daughters to be white racist alcholics in Africa.
__label__1 mouse woes: i picked this thing up specifically for headset use, and haven't even gotten to the connection part of setting this thing up, as myLogitech G5 Laser Mousegoes completely DEAD when i plug the wireless reciever in...seems like a good idea, but microsoft needs to update the drivers so they're more compatable with other USB items
__label__2 Bracketless Wipers are the way to go: Bracketless Wipers may be a bit more expensive than the regular wipers, but I would say they are worth the expense. These wipers are easy to secure and contour better on the windshield. Also, getting them online is much cheaper than in retail stores, especially if you can get free shipping.
__label__1 I was disappointed: I loved Anita Shreve's "The Weight of Water," and "Sea Glass." I read "The Pilot's Wife" after these two, and found it to be a disappointment. I think there was too much re: the initial shock and grief and too little of the "meat" of the story.
__label__1 Oh, come on!!!: During this book, I found my self saying "Oh, Come On!!" over and over. That pretty much sums up the whole book. From a video game supposedly causing the destruction of the free world, to a young lady bothering to go to a Neo-Nazi camp simply to yell "Screw You!" to a man in a wheel chair beating the heck out of a group of Nazi musclemen with only a broomstick handle and a knife.I don't know why I even bothered to finish this nonsense.
__label__2 Donna Richardson, Sweating in the Spirit: Workout has more dance style aerobics vs traditional steps. It has helped me reach my goal of becoming healthier. Overall I am happy with this product, it helps boost my energy level and I generally feel better.
__label__1 Borderline unintelligible: I do not recommend this book. It purports to deepen one's "awareness" or theoretical appreciation of tango but, instead, it mires you down in almost unintelligible concepts and distinctions. It was not enlightening at all, largely because it speaks in gibberish and sophomorish ideas. So, look elsewhere for some intellectual stimulation regarding tango.
__label__1 Not acceptible item 12 Language European Translator: Franklin EXPLORER FR-TVH12 12 Language European TranslatorThe 12 Language European Translator is a very slow device. It takes time to find a word in English and then it takes time to say that it can not find it in Russian. Even if it can find it, it not always gives correct translation.If you are looking for the words like a BOOK - this translator is for you. If you want it to help you to read a book, just forget about this one.... I've just purchassed it, and am begging the seller to take it back.
__label__2 Fun, quick read: This was another great book by Willig. Enjoy the fast-paced double story and even learn a new vocabulary word or two.
__label__2 Lennon's most important album: I don't take any notice of reviews or Rock Critics so I'm able to listen to an album via the Enjoyment factor.And here I would state that very little on the Plasic Ono Band has much to offer and is quite an uncomortable listen at times with ridiculous songs like Working Class Hero-which Lennon clearly wasn't he was brought up middle class unlike say George Martin who was born dirt poor.With Sometime in NYC Lennon was a political commentator who took some of the issues of the day to turn into songs.The sleeve is brilliant as its set out like a newspaper but this idea was used before by Jethro Tull for Thick As A BrickThe "bonus" disc is not important and something of a waste of time.I seem to think you can now buy this album on CD without the Zappa nonsense
__label__2 Learn to fly! Learn to live!: Robert Mason just wanted to fly helicopters - and this terrific book puts you so closely into his mind as he learns to fly that you feel as though you could fly one too. Sadly, he paid a high price for his love of flying. This is a great and moving story of how one man was forever altered by Vietnam.Rather than trying to make a statement about the war, Mason sets out to tell his own story. He does so with such honesty that you end the book feeling as irrevocably changed by events as he was. You share his growing panic and trauma as he comes to the end of his tour in Vietnam, and you share his guilt and bewilderment as he tries to cope with living in a peace-demonstrating, hippie-torn America.When you re-read the book - as you induitably will - you'll notice Robert Masons' compassion and humour, his sense of camaraderie, the combination of bravery and reluctance that make him and his comrades 'chickenhawks'.
__label__2 Worthy of the Pulitzer and more: This is truly one of the finest pieces of literature of the 21st century this far. The prose is beautiful and the story is haunting. I highly reccomendations this novel.-Mathew Foresta
__label__1 I hate this product: I have a desktop with XP on it and a laptop with built-in wireless. Both are my living room and the wireless router is down the hall. The Linksys USB wireless network adapter loses its connection three to five times a day. My laptop never loses a connection, so it obviously isn't the signal strength. To get the USB adapter working again, I have to unplug it and plug it back in to reset it. Also, if I use another USB port on my computer then it kills the wireless connection and I have to unplug it and plug it back in. This makes me crazy b/c I use my desktop computer to stream music while I work and I know right away when the usb adapter drops its connection and I have to reset it. Now I'm looking for a wireless LAN extender that I can plug my desktop into directly and throw this usb adapter in the garbage.
__label__2 it's awesome: This is a great game. I love character creation/development and the way a party of different classes is dependent upon each other. I'm still playing on the first disc but so far there is many many hours of exciting storyline and gameplay.
__label__2 Dog likes them, not sure if how effective the glucosamine is: Dog likes them, but not really sure if the glucosamine does much, or if there is even enough to make a difference. My dog is not exactly old and limping around so I'm not sure you would see much of a difference. He is getting a little older and I just want to get him a healthy snack.
__label__2 Good Workout!: I think this DVD is a good workout, however, I was slightly disappointed to find that it does not use any weights in the 4 miles. I have the 1, 2, and 3 mile DVD and all 3 of these do use the weights. This is a one hour workout and 4 miles but because of the lack of weights, it seemed somewhat easier than the 3 mile DVD that I already had.
__label__2 Highly recommended.: Got one about 9 years ago at a farm supply store. Took about 15 minutes to train my dog to use it. It finally wore out, started to leak, and needed to be replaced. It's a major convenience during the warm weather months. Remember to remove it during extreme freezing conditions. (Could damage your plumbing if allowed to freeze.) Quick delivery. Would buy again.
__label__2 Don't eat the meat!: Well written, entertaining, and amusing. However, by his own admission, he exaggerates and overgeneralizes much of the time.
__label__1 target board: the board fell apart soon as i threw a knife at it, its nice for decoration but not useful for target practice
__label__2 Esmeril de mesa: Un producto super util y bastante practico, con luces independietes que permiten ver mejor el trabajo que haces con el, una herramienta super util para el precio que tiene.
__label__1 tired: This book was a major disappointment to me. The first hundred pages were slow and hard for me to get into. It got more interesting around the middle but ended horribly with boring, trite, and preachy politics along with a lot of guilt. The historical background on the African Congo was a good history lesson for me, but not enough of a reason to suffer through it. Yawn.
__label__1 Not DS at her best.: I love Danielle Steel's work but this was not my type of enjoyable reading. Funny in the beginning I could not get a grasp of the concept that anyone could make a person so perfect as to make you believe they were real i.e. skin, hair, eyes, brain. heart. I guess that was my bottom line. It was not believable.It was definitely a step out of the ordinary for DS.
__label__1 Don't Waste Your Time: Moves slower than molasses! I read a short story by Jacquiline Carey and loved it, but it just doesn't translate into a full length novel. Ms. Carey is constantly hinting at what's to come, but never seems to get to the point, and I feel no empathy whatsoever for any of the characters. I feel like I've been reading this story for months, but am only 30% done on my Kindle - yikes! Unfortunately, this will be a book I'll finish when I have nothing else to read.
__label__1 Total Failure: Item was returned due to the fact it could not even shred one sheet without over working motor.
__label__1 Cheap and flimsy: Bought these to use as cleaning rags and replacements for paper towels. First time they got wet, the red dye bled everywhere. First time through the wash, the red dye bled everywhere and the edge "seams" frayed. Several fell apart. These are worthless. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 Stories in a weary mood, not his best: I had greatly enjoyed the Rabbit books and the excellent "Marry Me" and was hoping for more of the same finely tuned and energetic writing, but found to my disappointment that many of the stories in this collection meander without much drive.The subject manner tends towards an autumnal sense of reflection; this monotony of tone reaches its extreme with two stories in a row that both concern a middle-aged man contemplating the death of his mother.One story, "Cruise", throws in something like magical realism apparently out of boredom with the same old formula, or maybe just to see if anyone's paying attention (like a student gluing the pages of a report together before turning it in).For Updike completists only.
__label__2 Amazing!: The letter factory is amazing! My son has been going to a wonderful preschool and knew his letters and after two days of the dvd...he knows all of the letter sounds. I am amazed! This is definatly a great learning tool!
__label__2 It did not disappoint!: I am one that enjoys the side story in the series, however I have been disapointed before with side stories that are substandard, rushed, or loosely constructed. This did not disappoint, I recommend Bleach fans to purchase this movie for their collections. It has a great storyline with action, sense of honor, and friendship. If you don't believe me watch the movie and I'll bet you'd agree.
__label__1 U CANT BE SERIOUS: WHATS NEXT THE HARMONICA VERSION. OR TUPAC HITS ON AN XILAPHONE OR WHISTLING.............
__label__2 Not Bad: They have a very similar taste to a Mars bar, almost as good as the real thing. The only thing that I don't like is the after taste. It's not bitter but extremely sweet. It may just be my perception and maybe I'll get used to it. That aside won't stop me from getting more as you have little choice when you're on the Atkins diet.
__label__1 Silly movie: Mystery Men is a silly movie which I purchased because of it's low price of $2.49. In the "Zombie" genre, it really doesn't rank highly, in my humble opinion. Amazon did a great job at getting to me in a timely manner.
__label__1 cheap cheap!: I should have known- the price was pretty low. But the Solid Brass is MISLEADING! The thing is hollow. It may have a solid brass coating but with the hollow door knocker, it barely makes a noise when you use it. I was looking for a small solid brass door knocker because of space limitations and didn't realize this one would be so cheap!I think I will return but it will probably cost too much!
__label__1 Counter-productive for the Average Lifter: This book is about 25 years out of date with both scientific results and empirical observations on what works for the average, non-steroid popping individual.This was my bible for the first 5 years of my weight-lifting life, and it was the worst possible thing I could read. I trained as prescribed by Arnie and ate like a pig. I made only nominal strength and weight gains because like 95% of the population, I'm a 'hard-gainer', which means that unless I take steroids, lifting more than 3x a week is overtraining. Recovery time is at least one week per muscle group for the average person. According to Arnold's schedule, it's more like 24-48 hours.A year ago I switched to a much less physically and mentally taxing 2-3x a week plan typical of HIT (high-intensity training), and have seen gains of 2.5lbs/week on bench and 5 lbs/week on squat.Arnold's book is average for tips on form. Its training regimen is only for Mr. Steroids.
__label__1 waste of time: yo for any body that buys,listens or even believes a drop of what he says on this album you are is guilty as he is. Go to [...]and see the real truth. By the way that is not my web site for those that think im trying to get a financial plug and i make no funds or get any love offerings for ditributing this info. May God through "the real key" Jesus Christ forgive you and bless you for being so blind.
__label__2 amazing: great rosin nothing more to say. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a there that filled all the space.
__label__1 Horrible service: I really want to give them 0 stars. I have ordered my issue back in Jan and still have no received it. I have tried to contact the seller twice and still no answer.
__label__1 SENT IT BACK.....: I LOVE WILTON BRAND AND THE QUALITY OF THIS PAN WAS EXCELLENT HOWEVER IT WAS MUCH MUCH SMALLER THAN I ANTICIPATED -- IT WILL NOT ACCOMODATE THE BATTER FOR MY CAKES -- I DONT NEED A PAN I CANT USE SO I RETURNED IT......RARELY RETURN ANYTHING TO AMAZON.......WAS DISAPPOINTED BUT THAT IS OK -- LIKE I SAID IT WAS THE SIZE NOT THE QUALITY FOR ME........
__label__1 An unfinished garbled collection of thoughts: It's a book that has much promise and starts well. It all starts to fall appart after chapter 1! The code on the CD and the code in the book are not the same. What is there is badly written in a very difficult to understand style. Some code dosent even work, requiring modifications. Overall it gives the impression of being an unedited, inconsistant first attempt at writing a book on the subject. Takes too much effort to read and understand! The second edition is badly needed!
__label__2 4 + 1 in one single cartridge: Super Mario All-Stars already had a nice variety of games, but now Super Mario World is thrown into the mix!
__label__1 Disappointed: Just wanted to say how disappointing the DVD was. I found the editing "jumpy", the narration boring (Sorry Meryl) and the overall content lacking. A (any) National Geographic or Jacques Cousteau movie/video/DVD is FAR superior. Just a no-biggie DVD.
__label__2 four ghost stories: an older book but still good interesting read for those who love ghost stories and the world of the unknown
__label__2 A great Ref. Book: This book is great for anyone that might need to look up almost anything about a PC, from hard drive configurations to DOS commands. I would really suggest anybody having anything to do with PC support or repair to get this book and keep it handy.
__label__2 A good peek a boo book: I've read this to my kid since he was small. It's a really good and relatable book. My kid enjoyed the peek a boo aspect of the book.
__label__2 Excellent primer on community orgonizing: This book is an excellent primer for community orgonizing. Gecan lays out the principles of relating, acting, orgonizing, and reflecting pretty well. He has some excellent stories in the relating and acting sections though the orgonizing and reflecting sections are pretty sparse. Overall well worth the read because of the inspiring stories of real success.
__label__2 Good value, lots of cooking fun: Made of heavy plastic, this set has taken a beating from my four-year-old and six-year-old and held up well. The basket is appreciated to store all the pots pans and utensils when not in use. The kids love to pretend to cook, and this set gives them all the cookware they need, at a great price.
__label__2 very nice!: Recently, I bought a knockoff product that claimed to be designed for dogs "up to 77 pounds", for use with my 40-pound Samoyed. It broke the second day. The difference in the construction between the knockoff and this product are like night and day -- I'm reasonably certain the 77-pound model would have sufficed, but it is nice to be absolutely sure that a squirrel won't cause one to lose one's leash (or dog!)Bought it with theFlexi Leash Accessory Bag-Black, which fits fine, and has plenty of space for baggies *and* treats. For under thirty bucks, I recommend getting both.Update 2013-02-10: still working fine. Retraction isn't as whisper-smooth as when it was new. May have to replace it next year.
__label__2 Security lighting: This was exactly what I wanted with a minimal amount of installation work (and expense) and could not find it locally in hardware stores or big box stores. Price was very reasonable.
__label__1 Works, for a while...: I have a Creative Zen Touch and wanted to be able to listen to it in my car without spending a fortune on a new sterio. The sound isn't CD quality, but that's to be expected, over all still better than nothing at all. The one problem I've had with this device is the poor wiring. Not shortly after a few weeks of use, the wire connecting to my mp3 player seems to have split or "frey" internally which causes the left and right speakers to occasionally fade in and out when the wire moves. Secondly, the AC adaper has basically stopped working all together forcing me to use batteries which last only a few hours worth of play.My advice, if you're planning on listening to your mp3 player everyday for the rest of it's life, either spend $100 bucks to have a jack put onto your existing sterio so you can plug the player into it directly, or buy a new system all together for $250+.I loved this device, but now it's just a pain in the ass.
__label__2 Almost a Necessity: As a Bridge Engineer trying to figure out the new LRFD Code, I found this book to be a necessity. It is comprehensive in applying the code to actual designs. The design examples are thorough, and the logic can be followed. In all, I would recommend this book to anyone trying to learn all the provisions of the new LRFD Code.
__label__1 We love KNEX--just not this set.: We bought this KNEX set for our son last Christmas. We bought it even after reading reviews that said that it was too hard to get the tubes in the right position to make it work, thinking "our son can do it." He LOVES KNEX and was so excited to get it. The reviews were right--it is very frustrating and we never could get it to work really right. I suggest the other sets, especially the rollercoasters.
__label__2 Excellent book for a fundamental understanding of Java/OOP: I was looking for a book that gave a clear and concise explanation of Java and Object Oriented Programming, and that's exactly what I got! Unlike many other books, the examples are complete Java programs, which makes them easy to follow. As I read the book, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not a struggle to understand the concepts. Recently, I did not buy an Apache Web Server book on amazon.com because of the negative reviews. I've now decided I have to make a trip to the bookstore this weekend in order to make up my own mind. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in obtaining a good solid foundation in Java and not just tips and tricks!!!
__label__1 Total Waste of Time: Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for. Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier. Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business.
__label__2 A brilliant book: I keep it short and sweet. This is a brilliant book for a brilliant part of history. This is written how a history book should be written, making it in intresting and enjoyable book for anyone intrested Roman history. This easy reading book makes you come to your on conclusing on what to make of this time in history and not forcing a certain perspective on you. A brilliant History book on a important part in Western European Hisory.
__label__1 Cheaply made: This product was very disappointing when I received it. Although they are pretty to look at on my counter... they do not work properly. Whenever I open the lid the latch falls off, and the lid never lines up properly. The spoons are too long for the container, so they tilt to the side. You are better off spending a little extra $ and get one that works right, especially if you use them daily... save yourself the frustration.
__label__2 Great old movie!: This is a fine old movie when taken in the timeframe and context it was released in. It deserves to be released on DVD. Do it!!!!!!!!
__label__1 not a good cold pack at all: I bought this to use as a cold pack because I liked the form factor of it. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work very well. It is a good size, and it's lightweight compared to gel packs.I'm not sure how it is as a heat pack because I'm not interested in heat packs.
__label__2 Amazing peek into India: This is a mega epic of a life lived on the edge. The main character seems to fall into every step of his life somewhat by accident yet embraces every bit of the adventure with gusto. I definitely will read the next installment.
__label__2 My dr. recommended this book: I searched out this book after my dr. made the recommendation. Now I'm working on the transition - and so far, I'm enjoying eating again, and have lost both weight & inches.
__label__1 Judas from Brooklyn: The Movie is extremely boring and too long. However, you will never see Judas as he is portrayed, or at least how he talks, as in this film. As he usually does, Harvey Keitel takes over every scene he is in, and he is Hilarious as Judas who sounds and acts as if he just got off the subway in Brooklyn. No matter what he is in , he is great and to see him in this role and spouting words like a New Yorker is a hoot. See the movie for his scene stealing alone.
__label__2 WOW: Wow is all I can really say, the movie is a must see, it will keep you enthralled from start to finish, not really worth purchasing..still a must see!
__label__1 BLUE 88'S BOOGIE WOOGIE INSTRUMENTS: I couldn't find a way to listen to samples, so I took a chance and bought the cd because I wanted a boogie woogie piano cd. I didn't like the cd at all. I will not buy another cd without hearing a sample unless I know for sure what's on it.
__label__1 Worked for about 7 years, now dead: It worked ok for about 7 years. Now the timer dial doesn't turn anymore.Time to replace it.The worst part is the way the unit mounts to the spike.It is poor at best... barely stays on and falls off any time it's touched.I want to buy one that I will never have to replace.
__label__1 Could be better: I love soad and I was really looking forward to the followup. I heard chop suey on the radio and I got it the same week it came out. While the songs are very well written, it lacks the flow and the energy from the first album. Perhaps I had listened to the debut a bit too much, but I felt they took a little too much time with this one.
__label__2 Love it: Great water kettle. Had one for about five years when my husband broke the lid, and did not hesitate to buy the same one again.
__label__1 Be very careful when reading this book: Be very careful when reading this book. A lot of the information is outdated and is considered incorect. I think you could hurt your family by following this books advice.
__label__1 Mish-Mash: I must not have seen the same movie as most of the other reviewers.I thought this movie was all over the place........... anti-gun? Pro-Vigilante? Anti-Vigilante? Cop movie? romance??! Pro-Victims rights?!? What already. I got to the end of it and thought "well that was pretty much a waste of everyones time and money". Can't even say it was a pro-dog owning movie because the dog has to find HER at the end of the movie!What a mess.
__label__2 Try it for free...: ...at rollingstone.com. You can stream the entire album for free, though I don't know for how long. It is by no means a groundbreaking album--it's straightforward, and exactly what you'd expect from the bands included. But, the quality of the tracks is excellent. The Hoobastank song is real strong. And the Rob Zombie/Ozzy song is also great. Highly reccomended for fans of "nu-metal" (Is that not the stupidest name for the genre? I mean, who came up with that??)
__label__1 I have one word to describe this book, Pathetic.: Well this book isn't really that good I just got it to have something to laugh at when I compare it to my "How to draw manga volume 1","How to draw manga volume 2","How to draw manga volume 3", "How to draw manga pretty gal","How to draw manga Bishoujo Around the World",and "Techniques for Drawing Female Manga Character". If you compare the author of those books to this [author], Hikaru Hayashi will embarrass him. So don't waste your money on this book, buy a "How to Draw Manga.." book. If your are a beginner I prefer you get "How to Draw Manga Vol. 1-3", If your actually skilled and can draw then you should have no problems with the other manga books, but don't get this book.
__label__2 Cool Game: I like the game but is a little strange. There is also a strange easter egg too. Go to "continue game" and enter "L1TTLVN" to see a strange easter egg.
__label__1 Wrong one...: I got this install kit for my 95 Chevy S-10 Blazer, but once I opened it I immediately knew that it was the wrong one for my truck, just from the size of the area in my truck compared to the install kit. On the outside of the package and on the description says this will fit a 92' and up, but this is the wrong kit for my truck. Then when you look at the intruction booklet for my type of vehicle, it says this kit is for a 02 to 04.Wish there was a better way to make sure that this type of kit will fit before ordering, now I gotta worry if the seller will accept the product after I opened it. Hopefully the wire harness I ordered is the right one. I wished I woulda just got this from somewhere it was easier to exchange.
__label__1 Poor quality: First it was the wrong color which made it a duplicateof the purple and green. The ball broke in half the first time my nephew played with it,
__label__2 The Didache: I've been looking for a readable version of the Didache and am very pleased with this edition. I have a new appreciation for the early church fathers and the challenges they faced. I pray that those of us who call ourselves Christians can represent as well.
__label__2 Full House, 3rd season: I enjoyed this show when it was on TV originally, it's as good as it was then. I like the old sitcoms very much.
__label__2 Great product but WAY overpriced: I like this product, as does my son (though he hasn't quite figured out how to jump yet). But, it is totally not worth $170. I fail to see why it is so expensive, and no toy for an infant should cost that much. It only really plays one song. For $170 it should offer many more features. I bought mine at a consignment store and paid next to nothing. I say it's worth $75 at most brand new, which is about the price of the Rainforest Jumparoo It is a great toy, though it is big and rather cumbersome to lug around. However, to us it was a much better option than a door jamb jumper.
__label__1 Tedious, unnecessary detail: McDonough's stated purpose is to illustrate explanatory political models taken from the political sciences with specific illustrations lifted from his political career. Unfortunately, his analysis of the models is superficial and disorganized and his personal anecdotes are excruciatingly long and unnecessarily detailed. As a result, he is like the wise uncle who repeatedly masks his wisdom behind voluminous, forgettable chatter. For those interested in government and health care, this book is likely to be a complete waste of time. This is one volume it would help to look through at a bookstore before purchase.
__label__2 Lock Amoundo: I actually bought this chain and lock so I could ride and maybe lose weight. As it turns out, some idiot thought he could steal my 29" bike. Lets just say he went to the hospital then jail.Rock On.
__label__2 rving in westvirgina: My son got me a stereo for my rv for when I went to georga for my daughters wedding. It was the first tip I ever took This far in my rv since I got it last year.Let me tell ya This is a really sharp looking system and the sound is awsum! The trip was a realBlast If you know what I mean. great work jenson The wedding went great Except I had to give my little girl away!Proud and Happy Father.
__label__1 Crimes Against Reason: Coulter is the current mistress of political theatre and given much more respect and air time by the so-called liberal media than she deserves. Like most conservatives, she lacks critical thinking skills, a necessary factor for those who share this skewed, faith-based school of thought. Moreover, accusing Democrats as being treasonous i.e. aiding and abetting a foreign enemy by proxy, borders on libel. Truman, a traitor?With an inuenedo-based thesis Coulter resurects Joseph McCarthy as a fair-minded patriot trying to rid the nation of infidels lest free thought be allowed corrupt the system. By blindly accusing all of those with opposing views as enemies waiting in the wings for a communist totalitarian takeover, apparently led by Hollywood entertainment writers, Treason takes paranoia to an all time high and reason to a new sub-basement level. A quick scan of the news today would support the need for the latter. This work should be listed under fiction.
__label__1 Plastic crap, broke after 6 months: It performed great, shot thin laser beams of water at me (which I like), but the mounting is all plastic, and snapped broken after 6 months of being installed. Now I look like a wristcutter.
__label__2 This I sthe best version on the market "yet": Lately I have been reviewing Mattel and Yu-Gi-Oh! and it seems that this is just a prototype of the real launcher. THis is A perfect gift to give to a Yu-Gi-Oh fan for now but it's just a prototype and they are trying to make new ones that have the holographic projector. Once prototypes are put you'll Be able to play with the cards in your deck. It is suggested that when you buy this you only use cards that are on the market in that time. You'll need to get upgrades when you put New Booster cards in your deck.
__label__2 An Army of Four: Some play is a little choppy, and that's the only thing wrong with this game in my opion. The 5 star rating is for fun and realism (not that I fought in battle). If you play this game to it's full potential using all it's features and strategy... it really makes you FEEL like you're part of a real squad and you personally get hooked with each individual character and his special trait. To lose a character and have him replaced by a rookie has mixed emotions: 1)you have this green new guy who's gonna just walk in and replace your fallen comrad. 2)you feel sorry for the new guy and have to protect him, yet give him some real experience. Thing is... watch each others back and complete a mission without losing anyone. When I play this game it makes me feel part of a real team and have LOTS MORE RESPECT for the REAL boys out there fighting so that I can sit safe and comfortably playing this game.
__label__1 good book: i like cheese and rice oh my gosh snakes is not fun suck on ice chips and put the banana in the peel...
__label__1 Piece of Junk: I got one today. I was so excited. It states if is for 300 lbs. Well I weigh 207 and it did not hold my weight. It was a piece of junk. I laid on it with no problem, I got off my 8 year old got on it(watching him the whole time). He got off and I got back on it and it broke.I am so sad.
__label__1 hmmm really: Ok so you bash my style of worship hmm ok never did I see it in the Bible where it said praise God with a banjo, fiddle etc... I remember a harp hmm that style of music does not bother me but when you say its the only you are not geting that from the Bible my friend so you may want to look a little deeper because maybe your style of worship is not what it is suppose to be because I aint never heard a guitar or banjo in the Bible but a harp or 10 stringed instrument as long as the music is biblical and serves God you have no right to bash it. If you do not believe you should listen to it thats fine as Paul said in Romans we have personal convictions and those we should keep to ourselves. If God convicted me not to use a computer or read any other book besides the Bible that would be my conviction not yours
__label__2 good: good prodcut and shipment,hope it helpful for the health, will buy next time if it feel good aftering using it
__label__2 nice xmas present: very happy. it does what it says it will do. very easy and simple. only thing i could recommend, would be to include a cover with the kindle. i had to order and wait a week. i couldn't imagine taking it out with you without a cover.
__label__1 Mine was stolen out of the yard: Our dog had no problem going next to, and even occasionally on, the pee post. The problem we had is that within three days of us staking it into the ground some animal dug it up and took off with it. It wasn't our own dog, as we have him on leash outside (still a puppy). We live up in the mountains, so maybe bobcats like the pheromones?
__label__2 I could watch this movie over and over and over...: A friend of mine told me a few years ago that I would love this movie since I have enjoyed other films such as Emma (w/ Gwyneth Paltrow), Sense & Sensibility (w/ Emma Thompson), and Mansfield Park. So, when I saw it on A&E as a remastered DVD edition, I decided to buy it from Amazon.And I love this movie! I have only had it for a little over a week and have watched it twice already! The dialogue, the actors, the costumes, the settings, everything is wonderful. The only reason I give it four stars is that I hoped they would add more extras to the DVD menu.I found nothing wrong with the color or sound as some reviewers mentioned. In fact, I could hear a clock ticking in the background (not my clock, one in the movie) in a few scenes. I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of movies based on Jane Austen's wonderful stories. You'll love it! Just make sure you can set aside time for weekly viewings since watching it just once isn't enough! : )
__label__1 Pure junk: We purchased 3 of these to send with some gift boxes to African children, hoping they would send them back with photos on the cameras. I tried it out here in the States, and could not get the software to download the photos to work. I was able to get it to function like a webcam, but no screen to download photos. We threw the cameras away and just bought inexpensive film cameras instead.Argus was of absolutely no help, don't even try to get tech support.....
__label__1 Please don't buy this!: This cookie press made only 8 cookies before it broke! (I was using regular, non-refridgerated dough.) I had an older Wilton cookie pro and was having troubles with that so decided to buy a new Wilton cookie pro ultra II. What a mistake. Luckily I was able to get my old American Harvest jerky gun and the cookie disks from the Cookie Pro fit. I was able to finish making my cookies.Will never buy another plastic cookie press!
__label__1 Not nearly long enough.: The guided meditation is alright but very short. If I realized this I wouldn't have bought it.
__label__1 NOT EXTREME!!: Don't buy any of the GGW "extreme" DVD's! I got roped into buying 1-4 from GGW themselves. I've seen other GGW's that I liked but these are boring. Old footage that they can't sell anymore unless they trick you buy calling it "extreme". It's mostly all shot outside, and it is only topless. Do not be fooled by the title like I was! These are anything but "extreme"!
__label__1 sound not acceptable: Could hear dialog even at full sound!!! did not finish movie!should return for refund! still not worth the nine bucks!!
__label__1 Amazon VOD experience - not so hot: I decided to minimize playback issues related to servers and Internet connections and downloaded the entire movie first. Sure, no skipping or halts. However, even hooked up to an HDTV via HDMI, the resolution was terrible, and tons of shadowboxing, ghosting, and pixelation. And I don't know if it was how the movie was shot, but the lighting and backdrop colors were HORRIBLE. Either the scenes were too bright or the skies were some weird, bright pastel color.This is the first and last time I bother doing a VOD rental. I'll stick to renting the actual disc. Glad I didn't pay a thing for it as I had a promotional credit.OBTW, the movie was okay - still say Prisoner of Azkaban was the absolute best. Not exactly a fun diversion - I think I chuckled once or twice. It was all dread, sorrow, anger, and angst the rest of the time. The big problem with splitting it up in to two movies - it's all lead up, no resolution. Makes you think they should only charge half the price?
__label__2 What A Kitchen Tool!: I saw this tool recommended by Alton Brown on the Food Channel. I love chicken fried steak but want to stay away from the fatty meats. He said to tenderize your own lean bottom round to make cube steak. Are you wondering if I'm deranged?....chicken fried steak is as greasy as it gets, why worry about fatty meat? Well, I do well with meat protein but don't want the saturated fats. I can fry it in olive oil which is a healthier source of fat....so I can have chicken fried steak once in a while with less guilt.The 48 blade tenderizer is a wicked device that is made well. It's not a cheapy gadget. I have used it on top sirloin steaks before bbq'ing and they are like eating filet mignon. Using it on veggies and meats before marinating made for more flavorful absorption.A must for anyone who is having dental work done, wears dentures or has partial plates. You can chew with ease again.I'm giving them out as gifts. An impressive gift for the price.
__label__2 Just three things to say: 1. I love metal as much as the next metal head but this is NOT a metal album - get over it! If your sole review comprises 3 stars because this isn't metal you really need to consider broadening your horizons.2. Apart from metal I also love all other kinds of music including classical, blues, folk, jazz, fusion, flamenco, etc. etc. This IS some really good acoustic guitar and piano music. Buy it! You won't regret it!3. If you liked this album check out Zakk with Black Label Society - Hangover Music Vol 6. More of the same though there are a few heavier tunes mixed in. Not quite the normal full on BLS heavy but a little heavier.
__label__1 doesn't open wide enough: I have worked in a professional kitchen and am very familiar with using tongs. These simply do not open up wide enough, (without using both hands) They only 'spring' open to about three or four inches, which doesn't allow you room to grab a whole lot. These are ineffective tongs. I ended up returning this product for the cuispro (I think is the brand) nylon tipped spatula, which I love.
__label__2 Amazing, powerful, funky!: Do NOT go into this amazing album expecting School of Fish! I was lucky enough to experience Josh (rest his early-departed soul) live as an opener for Tori Amos, where he and his guitars alone battled against the audience like an orchestra.... for THAT, pick up his live album. For THIS... expect studio work and grooves, less fuzzy and hardcore than School of Fish, more lighthearted, more from the delicate, smiling soul. It is indeed a funky album, heavy in clear guitars, a far degree from the power-alternative of SOF.Incredibly spiffy, and keep an eye out for his long-awaited post-mortem album, Spirit Touches Ground, to be released soon!
__label__2 Leviton Flush Inlet - low price and it works: Works great! A good device to have when designing a permanent connection for a generator or other power source to your house - or could be used for a camper or RV. Note that this is really not meant to be used while being rained on - there are other devices (more costly) that are made for such use. I am using mine under a carport where rain cannot hit it.
__label__2 well crafted: Well constructed storyline with a myriad of characters. May be a little convoluted but still gripping. I like Linda Fairstein's style based, clearly, on her profound knowledge of her subject. My criticism is that like other of her stories her heroine, Alex, ends up being attacked by the guilty party. In real life I would think she would have resigned long ago.
__label__2 Good sound, good headphones: I wore 'em till they wore out. Definitely my favorite style of headphones. These had good sound that lasted until the end (over a year--good for cheap headphones). The speakers lasted just as long as the foam padding, but did give out after repeated volume-at-11 listenings.
__label__2 AWESOME CD!: I never had heard AFI till about 2 years and then I saw the"Days of the Phoenix" video and LOVED it. So i looked em up on the internet and ended up adoring all their albums. I bought this album the week it came out and ITS GREAT! They are great to be able to come up with new things to add on each album and they just did the sweetest job on Sing The Sorrow. My advice to anyone would be to buy this AWESOME album. Its majorly worth it!
__label__2 Happy Lemons = Happy Kids: Ralph continues to "WOW" our family with his latest CD, Happy Lemons. The music is upbeat and lively with wonderful lyrics.Our boys, who are 4 and 18 months old LOVE listening to Ralph. The 4 year old is an expert Surfer Dude, and his little brother loves to do the "Belly Button." Mom & Dad also join in on the dancing and singing.What a wonderful way to spend time together as a family. We also had the pleasure of seeing Ralph in person twice. For information on where he will be playing, visit his website.One last word of advice...Don't play Ralph World's CDs during dinner if you want the kids to eat.
__label__2 Great read, the best yet on the Valley phenoms: much much better than Po Bronson's much hyped 'the nudist on the late shift'. having spent 3 yrs in the valley now (in the trenches of a start-up), its a fascinating and well written look at some of the dynamics and the mechanics... a few factual errors which are annoying but do not detract from the story-telling abilities of the writer.
__label__2 The Ersatz Elevator: The Ersatz Elevaator is a great book in all. It shows how hard orphans' life can be and Esme is what the heck kind of a person. I learned that life can be hard while searching for Count Olaf. You should read the Ersatz Elevator! :)
__label__2 Pure Canadian talent!: One the greatest underated talents of all. Blue Rodeo combines sweet harmony with country-rock that is unmistakenly Canadian. Listen carefully to the lyricks in "Trust yourself" and you'll encounter true songwritting genious. I highly recommend this album as an intro to Blue Rodeo and don't forget you can also find Jim Cuddy (Blue Rodeo )doing solo albums.
__label__2 Luggage Straps -- Add-A-Bag: We got several of these before our overseas (by plane) trip. They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc. They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying). I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost.
__label__2 RAP OLE SKOOL CLASSICS: I PERSONALLY MET EACH OF THESE ARTISTS BACK IN THE DAYS, I KNEW THEIR MANAGER, TYRONE WILLIAMS. HE TAUGHT ALL OF HIS ARTISTS TO ALWAYS INVEST IN THEIR FUTURES, AND TO ALWAYS GIVE BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITIES NO MATTER HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY'VE BECOME. MR. WILLIAMS NEVER LEFT HIS COMMUNITY AS HE STAYED GROUNDED WITH EACH OF HIS ARTISTS. THE "JUICE CREW ALL STARS" SHOULD ALWAYS BE AN IMPRESSIONABLE AND TALENTED GROUP TO BOTH YOUNG AND OLD IN THE HIP HOP AND RAP WORLD.
__label__1 Poor quality: This product is a poor substitute for the Skip and Hop brand. We lost our two year old's skip and hop and went for the cheaper product, figuring it would be in use for a short time. Sorry I decided to go cheap. The fabric doesn't wipe clean (nasty), it is smaller, and less well put together. Go for the skip and hop for ten dollars more.
__label__2 Tight A$$ CD: First off let me start by saying diamonds and wood is the tightset song i have ever heard. man i don't think there will ever be another song as tight as diamonds and wood, and im talking bout from anybody, that includes jay-z cash money no limit, and even 2pac.this cd is tight from start to finish, what i don't understand is why all of these wack groups and labels like cash money, no limit, and rocafella getting all of this recognition and ugk is still considered underground, and still not being respected and none of these wack groups or labels can come close to them. well this is a must for anybody that listens to ugk, and who loves 3rd coast rap.
__label__2 Sweet jazzy voice...: For some reason she reminds me of Julie Andrews without an english accent. Has beautiful phrasing, voice quality, and renditions of classic songs that you will enjoy. I have over 5,000 CD's and I know a winner when I hear it. All 3 of her CD's are fabulous
__label__1 Very rough, not fit for children to sleep on.: I actually returned the product. My son was so excited the day it arrived I let him look at it but running my hand across the comforter, it actually felt like sandpaper. My son has sensitive skin, I would never let him sleep on something that feels that rough on my hand, I can't imagine it up against his face!!
__label__1 by the way, this album is horrible: as a long time fan of RHCP, I waited in great anticipation for this new release. upon first listen, I couldn't believe what they've turned into. By the Way is a regurgitation of their old sappy ballads (such as Under the Bridge) mixed with a few spacey sound effects. it's like the RHCP strapped on knee and elbow pads, buckled on a helmet, and took a bunch of prescription ibuprofen before jumping into the mosh pit of album writing. the music is weak, not at all unique, and the lyrics are horrible. please, do not spend your money on this.
__label__2 Great book on a touchy subject: Death is not an easy thing for anyone to deal with, not just the death of a person, but of cherished pets too. So what if you could bring a beloved family pet back? Would you be willing to call upon ancient cursed burial grounds? That is the question Steven King asks us. This novel is simply terrifying. What strikes me though, is King's trademark of putting slices of humanity into all of his books. I just about broke down crying when I read the part where Louis and Gage fly a kite. I don't know if King has any kids, but if he doesn't he sure knows what a good father-son relationship is like. Getting back to Pet Sematary, the morbid subject matter of ressurection will keep you turning pages well into midnight. I sat up reading it around 1:00 AM and didn't stop until I had read the last page. Then I didn't fall asleep until about 3:00 AM because I was so scared. Keep 'em coming Mr. King!
__label__1 Try them if you don't want to sleep: I never suffer from Insomnia but I was very tired last night and I wanted to have a good night of sleep, My husband has bought them, took them once and did not do anything to him, so I had one pill last night, only one, and could NOT fall asleep the entire night finally I got up at 3:00 A.M. got a tylenol p.m. and 30 mins. later I was deeply asleep. I wanted something natural but this thing is useless. So instead of helping me I think these pills were the cause of my insomnia, would never try them again.
__label__1 Ripped off: Please be advised that the book grove sent me what they called a new dvd of lady and the tramp. When I receieved it, it was obviously used. Upon further inspection, I saw that the case was computer generated complete with type o's. In other words, this is bootlegged and passed off as new and sold for new. Buyer beware of this company.
__label__1 Troubled From Day One: I was so excited to begin this book with my church family. Unfortunately I found myself troubled from day one. The purposes in this book are scriptural, but the author quotes "the Bible says" countless times with so called paraphrase translations that are inaccurate at best. If you do read this book have a reliable translation and check the quotes yourself. (NASB, NIV, NKJV or KJV) The Bible does say, "Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handing the work of truth." 2 Timothy 2:15 NASB
__label__1 Too Many Mistakes: I was considering buying this book for a birthday present but fortunately happened to see a copy in my local library. It reads easily but has several gross historical and geographical errors which make me wonder about the accuracy of the facts in the rest of the book. The most egregious of these errors (page 66 and elsewhere) places the Cumberland gap near Cumberland, Maryland, when in fact it is at the Kentucky / Virginia border some 400 miles to the southwest. Also, I wonder about the cotton mill in Utica, New York in 1811 (p-150). How did the unspun cotton get from the south to a frontier town in upstate New York at that date ? I feel that there is simply no excuse for any non-fiction book on a historical subject to be marred by errors which could and should have been easily detected.
__label__2 3D Game Creation by Luke Ahearn: I think this is a nice game maker for rookies I got this book but pie in the sky software was old on mine so it wouldn't go because a have a new computer. The games Factory is a fun way to make 2d games. I've made a level on a game and its pretty good. I think this is good for rookies that want to become game makers. It talks you through the different games and walk you through carefully I like it.
__label__1 Barking Dog Alarm: I was very satisfied with the vendor, no problem. But the product itself left much to be desired. I already had/have one Barking Dog Alarm. It works great. However, this new one, although it looks precisely the same, isn't. The "voice" of the dog apparently has undergone some changes in manufacturing, and the barking has degraded. The quality isn't there. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless the flaw is corrected. The vendor was very good to work with, though, and returned my money quickly.
__label__1 Not Enough Action: You Don't Get To fight, You Make Deals and Set Up Deals Buy Drugs But The Game Does The Fighting Taking The Fun Out That Really Sucks
__label__2 AWESOME!!!: This book was SO good ! I loved it.Especially the note the guy writes that says "I loved when I turned the pool purple because my favorite color is purple!"or something like that!
__label__2 What existed pre-Big Bang: This is a question serious philosophers snort at when they hear. Any of the most profound questions we come up with as kids are ignored by the know-it-alls who know nothing. Such is a question asked in Pi, a film that works on many levels among them: avant garde filmmaking, asking if there is an intelligence behind all that exists, and finding the pattern of that intelligence, implementation of electronic music effectively, theoretical physics, and chaos theory. Max Cohen finds the secret to the whole universe; both an Einstein and Christ of his generation who can't handle this ultimate knowledge. This film enters a realm we will spend the whole next millenium trying to understand.
__label__1 Bland Music: The music/singing isn't very fun or creative - I'm sticking with Lori Berkner, David Weinstone or They Might Be Giants and going acapella with the classics for my 2 year old. I wanted a basic CD of some of the classics, but this one is doomed to the yard sale pile.
__label__1 Disappointing Addition to Stone Barrington Series: The earlier Stone Barrington novels were farfetched, but riveting, with an attractive hero and tongue-in-cheek humor. But, in "Worst Fears Realized," Stuart Woods continues a decline that began with the execrable "Orchid Beach." This book is better than "Beach," but not by much. It does have Stone Barrington, which is something. But where is the humor? Where is the mystery? Woods is writing by numbers these days, and it's unfortunate, because the man can write well. When he tries.
__label__2 Great Book!: One of the best books I have read in the last few years. The only people who won't like it are those who believe the Bible is fact. This is a thought provoking book and was great entertainment.
__label__2 Great Service !: I've received the product on time.. And when I asked for replacement, the company [Technoline] was very prompt in sending me the postage packet and subsequently the replacement component..Very satisfied with the service of Technoline..
__label__2 Great long lasting mens fragrance: This is actually one of the best smelling and longest lasting men's EDT that I own.In my opinion it's a fresh clean somewhat spicy fragrance that is not at all over bearing, and feels good on the skin as well as lasting all day and into the evening. By the way I do not smell rubber, or anything like a mechanical smell.What I smell in this cologne is fine tobbaco, rain, a little spice and a slight floral scent. Blended perfectly together where no one scent over takes the other.The fact is different colognes do not smell the same on all people, so if you can, find either a vial tester or try to find it in a store before you invest about $70.00 into a bottle.
__label__2 This game is very entertaining, and fun!: Battle Tanx is a shoot-em-up game where you just battle against other teams, a tank that is trying to destroy your convoy, auto-gun turrits, or more. You have your own tank, that is designed depending of which team you choose. You can also pick up things like helth, ammo, other ammo, and shields. There are some choices like convoy, battlelord, tank wars, and more. You also select where your battle will take place. This is a VERY great, fun, worth big bucks, and good game. BUT, this games is not for kids 8 and under.
__label__2 Resource for parents and teachers: I purchased this because I was interested in where my daughter was supposed to be. I found that in this age of differentiated instruction, this would help with RTI and making plans for the different levels in my class...
__label__1 Crime against humanity: The only entertainment you'll get is spotting things like American street signs and Pinkberries on the streets of "Tokyo". $22 for this visual vomit? They should pay people $22 to watch this. This is like the porn version of Cloverfield, except without any sex and lots of long, long, long monologues from awful actors.Blech.
__label__1 Size: The big picture says the size is 6"x 12"but if you read downit says 5.5"x12" but in reality it is 11.5' x 5.5"Good for fishdinner for one.
__label__1 A Picture Book: I bought this and "Waiting for Baby" for my son when I was expecting his first sibling. I was unhappily surprised to find they did not have words, just pictures. That definitely should be part of the product description.It isn't too hard to make up a story, but if I would have known it was lacking words I never would have bought it.
__label__2 Close-up recording: I am in the process of collecting all of the Vaughn Williams symphonies by the Bournemouth Symphony on the bargain Naxos label. So far, all have been performed and recorded well, except this one which was recorded with a too-close perspective and insufficient acoustic environment - particularly the soloists who might as well not even be in the same acoustic space as the orchestra and chorus. The otherwise fine performance is marred by a recording that strives for clarity over ambiance.Please do not be put off by my comments about the technical quality, this is a very good performance, and Symphony No. 1 is a good introduction to Vaughn Williams for those not familiar with his work.Update:I found I enjoyed this recording more every time I played it. Without the up-close perspective, it would not sound so "big", and this is a big work -- its subject is the sea, after all. So, I have come to believe that the recording perspective is entirely appropriate for this work. Recommended.
__label__1 Tamp isn't the best fit for my KRUPS: I ordered this tamp after verifying that it was the correct tamp for my KRUPs model espresso machine on the KRUPS website. I find it strange that the tamp isn't quite big enough for the fill basket, and the scoop doesn't fill the basket with enough grind, making a watery shot. So, I think KRUPS makes this tamp and scoop to accommodate several of their models, causing it to fit poorly on all of them. I am able to use it on my machine, but I would expect it to actually fit for the price. I'm also disappointed that it is made of plastic.
__label__1 Twin Towers: the life of NY World Trade Center by Gillespie: Book is totally MISREPRESENTED (...) It is not an oversized photo book of the World Trade Center (as shown) but a truly boring history (copy only) of the WTC with a disgustingly few, black and white mini-illustrations. (...)
__label__2 Lesbian Films Don't Get Any Better Than This!: "Better than Chocolate" hits every touching,exciting angle of lesbian 'first love.' Wow,if we could only bottle those feelings ofraw physical desire. And Christina Cox, whata body!A beautifully made movie.This is a must for every lesbian whoremembers falling in love. Made me smile fromear to ear!
__label__1 belt sander: The dust colecter does not work at all. Will not pick any dust. I will not use it again. Own other DeWalt tools that are good, but this one is JUNK.
__label__1 just useless: this band does not give you any support, It is just useless. I returned it immediately. Would not recommend it.
__label__1 They lost their one chance to immortalize Phantom...: For starters, I haven't seen the movie. I'm just a multimedia store employee that was excited to see a promotional copy of the new Phantom soundtrack. Well...I have to say Sir Webber and others took what is considered the most famous musical and butchered it. The female voices in the movie are great. However the male voices leave more than a little to be desired.If you listen to the soundtrack you can't help but feel that the man playing the Phantom is none other than someone who smokes WAY too much. His voice is gruff and unfeeling throughout the disk. Raoul's voice however reminds one of an 80's metal band rock-ballad in his cheesy way of singing.And of course who could miss the electric waa-waa guitar during "The Phantom of the Opera."I don't think I can forgive Sir Webber for this.
__label__1 Action but not much acting: This is an early B-western starring Ken Maynard and does not have a music soundtrack so the action stumbles in some segments. Moreover, the acting ranges from mediocre to good with the real star ironically being bad guy Captain Serge Karlov, an outlaw gang leader based in Mexico across the border from the Arizona territory.Karlov and company earn a living by robbing in the Arizona territory and in this film also murder Dan Savage's (Ken Maynard) best friend.The script is decent and there are a few twists, so the suspense holds until the end.This DVD release from Alpha is from a fair 16mm print which has approximately twelve missing frames, some dark scenes, surface noise and in some places loud audio hiss. But, all things considered it is better than many other Alpha releases and worth a dollar plus shipping. It is not worth $7.95 or even $5.00.I doubt you will want to watch this more than once and it certainly is not worth watching on a high-def screen.
__label__2 Close to perfect as it gets....: The first thing you'll think when you watch this DVD it is: "What the heck are they doing with those robots". But by the fourt episode you will fully understand the story and will get into it.I'm a fan of big robots and military stories, so if you're into this type of anime go ahead and get it. The main character is misterious and instantly drags you into the plot, and without you thinking about it you'll want to know what the purpose of the TA system really is. I give it four stars since the anime is a little too old for me.Over all Gasaraki is one of the best looking anime of recent years and any fan of big robots and well chorographed action secuences will more than enjoy this series.
__label__1 Doesn't work for long: The first one I purchased lasted about 2 weeks, then sparked and smelled like something was burning and quit working. Exchanged it for another one - it lasted about 3 weeks - then the same thing. Have now purchased a different brand. Would not recommend this product.
__label__2 A great read!: I couldn't put this book down. This sweet, sad and happy story just pulled me in and wouldn't let go. I loved the interesting and quirky characters that seasoned this compelling tale of a woman in search of her past. I won't soon forget Sookie, Dr. Diggers and Aunt Elner.
__label__1 Dead battery: I purchased this unit for an airplane trip with the kids. While I had tested it briefly at home to make sure it worked, I hadn't tested the battery. Within one minute of using it on the plane, the unit went dead. While it would work off the AC adapter, the battery would not take nor hold a charge. I researched portable DVDs extensively before this purchase and was not sold on any unit in the $200 price range. Due to my concerns, I made sure to buy from a local, reputable dealer so that I could return it if I had problems. I am glad I did. The day after my trip, I returned it. I cannot recommend buying a unit from Go Video nor any portable DVD player at this price. I plan to wait a year and then look to buy again.
__label__2 The best (worst tasting) stuff out there: It feels odd that this product is getting such a great review for tasting so bad, but hey, that's the point.My problem wasn't nail biting so much as nervous finger chewing, causing ugly callouses. I do it absently while coding or reading at the computer, and was finding it hard to realize that I was doing it.The only thing I think is good to know about this is that it's more like a fingernail polish than a dollup of bad tasting stuff. It sits better on your fingernail than directly on your skin. And it lasts a while, so you can actually be flossing a few days later and still taste it.I see this more as the downside of a bad habit. Two weeks after applying this three times, I'm not *even* chewing my fingers anymore. Yuck, but cool!Oh, and stay away from that "Thum" stuff; totally ineffective for adults. Malva Stop is what you want.
__label__2 good read: One of Teresa Medeiros better reads a book that is difficult to put down. Definitely a good read especially on a rainy day.
__label__2 Anne Rice - Blackwood Farm: I loved Interview with a Vampire - one of the best vamp books ever written. I lost track of the books after Lestat but I'm so glad I came back and found Blackwood Farm. Entertaining it is!
__label__2 Fun!: My husband and I purchased this book and "Do you know your husband?" We enjoyed answering the questions as a fun way to get to know each other better.
__label__2 Cannon SD-750 spare battery: A not so expensive spare battery for my Cannon SD-750. Equal to the official Cannon battery.wallyc
__label__2 FURminator for dogs: This is a great tool. It really removes a lot of hair and my dog doesn't seem to mind. I would recommend it.
__label__2 A HIT, AFTER TWO STRIKES OUT OF THE COURTHOUSE: Seems like Grisham finally did it, after two disappointing novels out of the legal world in which he became a master, he finally wrote a good novel that has nothing to do with the legal system. Bleachers is a story of lost hero's, of the good old times, of regret and the human condition.
__label__2 A magical literary experience: You won't be able to put this book down. Richard Paul Evans' style is the perfect combination of beautiful language and an easy read. Turn off the phone and the TV and give yourself a real treat by reading The Locket. I started at 10pm and finished it at 2am--feeling moved and changed and like I was saying goodbye to old friends.
__label__1 Dice rolls not random.: This game has three difficulty levels, and after playing this game a lot, I have the opinion that the only thing making it more difficult at the higher two levels is that the dice rolls are not truly random and of course, it does not make a mistake. In a human to human backgammon game on the kitchen table, the rolls are going to be random and each human is going to make a few errors. This is a good way to get some practice if you are by yourself, but at the higher levels quickly becomes frustrating to win 1:10 and I do not think is worth more than $10. with shipping.
__label__2 Nice Headphones: It was a fast delivery and the product was the same as explained. Nice Business Dealing :)
__label__1 Don't Buy It: My experience with this mat and the company who makes it was extremely bad. If you don't practice yoga in a dungeon or a dark closet this is not the mat for you. If you ever need to return it or ask for help from the company, this is not the mat for you. ANY sunlight AT ALL renders the mat unusable do to lack of stickiness. Why do YOU buy a sticky mat? I buy mine for the, guess what, STICKINESS!!!!There is supposedly a label when you buy it about this, however, since ANY light will cause the 'sun damage' its really mot. If you call the company and ask for help, the receptionist is likely to be amused by your problem (which she obviously hears a lot) and refer you to the owner whose disinterest is palpable through his e-mail which basically says in polite terms: too bad, so sad.I am strongly considering making a claim through the Better Business Bureau.
__label__2 This is a great razor: I replaced a Norelco Quad action with this razor. I have been using it for about two weeks and love it. It shaves me in about 75% of the time it took with the old razor and the shave is closer, much closer. I have had no skin irritation, although the additional holes in the screen cause a bit more drag across my face. The battery shaves for weeks on a single charge. The main thing I like is the closer shave. I got the expensive 9190, but I assume that any of the SmartTouchXL shavers would do the same job. I would buy this razor again.
__label__1 Great comedy: I laughed until I cried. But after the first 20 pages or so, I realized that this guy was SERIOUS. Then, I just plain cried. People actually BELIEVE THIS! When I found this in my mailbox, I immediately thought it was one of my friends playing a joke on me. Oh well.........I was wrong; particularly after I read some of the five star reviews. By the way - do you know you must give at least one star??A. Jan Marcussen - I know God will forgive you but He may have a few insights for you once you leave this world and enter His.
__label__2 Best show ever!!!: This is my favourite tv show and I was amazed at the bargain price of this box set. Would definately recommend to any fans of fantasy shows. Also very impressed with the delivery speed from the USA to England. Very pleased with this purchase.
__label__1 really??: Product seems fine but I do not trust a company that advertises a 20 rebate by mail, which, after sending in everything required, says that you basically sent them NOTHING and does not even contact you to inform you of this. I do NOT recommend this product to anyone, even my worst enemy. I can only imagine what other suprises await.
__label__1 Not Good For Your Gear: This adaptor seems like a good idea until the tips pops out after a while and gets stuck WAY DEEP in the 1/4" plug on your gear. This is the second one that's done that, and it's really about time I've learned my lesson. What happens in this adaptor is that the tip and ring are attached badly, and because most 1/4" plugs contact on one side, it loosens the assembly and evently you loose it deep in the recesses of your expensive equipment, causing you to need to disassemble the gear to go in and get the parts back out (as I did with a mixer and an amp) or if you can't get at the back of the plug, you'll have to send it out to a tech and pay money to have the work done. Do yourself a favor and buy a big, lovable, clunky old molded one. I've never had molded ones break except for the outer cladding cracking sometimes.
__label__2 Somewhere between pretty good and very good: One of no limit's best after C-Murder's life or death.It is true that the beats do not blend with Snoop's voice,but still there are certain tracks on this CD that alone make this a classic.To name a few,Slow Down feat. Mia X,Woof feat.Fiend and Mystikal,and especially See ya when I get there feat.C-Murder and Mystilal.Bout it and Rowdy feat. Master P is typical No Limit material.People who are not fond of no limit will probably not like this album,but those who are fans will love it.
__label__1 The Lost Baron isn't really worth reading...: A big reason I didn't like this book very much was because it didn't get good till the last 1 or 2 chapters. (Well, that's my opinion.) The rest of the book was just bland.
__label__2 Perfect for the middle aged and out of shape: My husband and I both love all of Peggy Cappy's DVD's. They are perfect for middle aged out of shape people who wish to regain their balance and flexibility. Peggy Cappy also has a very good yoga DVD for back care.
__label__1 My 4 cup coffee maker stopped making good coffee after 3 months of use.: This coffee maker started out working fine, but after three months there is something wrong with the way it is brewing... it is sending water through the thing too quickly or something, and half of the grounds inside the filter remain dry. Water just goes right through it for a weak brew no matter how much coffee you use. I'm tired of this capitalist system that supports crappy products that break.
__label__2 Cat5 Cable at a Good Price: For the price, I have no complaints with this cable. I have definitely used higher quality cable in the past, but at a much higher price tag. The main difference in this cable and its more expensive counterparts is this cable has more of a likelihood to kink or tear while you are pulling it. As long as you are not a raw brute when pulling this cable, you won't have any problems with it. If it stops flowing out of the box, do NOT give it good yank. Just pop open the box and straighten it out. I may have needed to this 5 times when using the entire box. I would definitely purchase this product again. The nice thing about this cable is that it is very flexible making complicated runs very neat and tidy. I will be using this cable for a home audio system using Russound audio products. I can't wait to get it all done!
__label__1 !!!CRUMMY MOVIE!!!: Captain America wasn't worth the $8.25!! Even as a fan of Super-Hero movies, this wasn't good at all. The action scenes were brief and predictable. No good fight scenes, predictable and uninteresting plot, my friend even fell asleep! The action scenes were all the same: Captain America running through Nazis and punching them in the face, then moving on to the next. THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS JUST A PROMO FOR MARVEL'S NEXT MOVIE: THE AVENGERS.
__label__1 Don't Buy this Product!!!: This is the most innacurate thermometer I have ever come across. Each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more. Moreover, the battery only lasts for 1-2 uses. Granted, one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature, but you would think the battery could last a few more times. When you have a sick child, accuracy and time are of the essence.
__label__2 future generations need this: cmon---we know this one---gotta see a movie when the model T was a baby. A world standard, like the sound of music. I fear that our present secretary of states' subliminal popularity can be attributed to the wonderful appeal of shirley jone's likeness [h. clinton] Sad!!! ABSOLUTELY no comparison!!! preston cant be followed in this awesome project. a high bar is set that no one will surpass. the sadder but wiser girl for me!
__label__1 The worst Zelda game ever: I have played every Zelda game ever, and let me tell you, it`sthe worst game. The game is [way] to easy! Andit`s a cartoon type game. Why couldn`t the game be better?I love Zelda games, and like I said I`ve played, owned, andbeat every one, and I dont lie when I say every one!!!! I wish a little more effert was in the game.?!?!?!?!
__label__2 Good for the hard-core Simp. fan...: It's a fun, easy-quick read, and all very interesting. The only problem I have with it is the childish writing style, but I guess it suits what it is. You certainly get a glimpse of the person writing it. The bits with Kesley Grammer were the best, if you ask me. Really funny stuff here.
__label__1 Tedious and boring. Sorry, I was actually expecting to love this.: Based on all the "this is the best photo book ever written" reviews and what a few photographer friends mentioned to me also, I trusted that I would love this and went ahead and bought it. I forced myself to get about one third through it. This was just tedious and boring and hard to read, with a few very "on the money" remarks. A few times I felt "ah haaa, now its picking up" just for it to get tedious again. I would like to edit it down to about three interesting pages.He needed to apply his understanding of editing photographs to his writing also. I have no pressing desire to try to make myself get through the remaining two thirds just to see if it gets better. If it actually does, the book should just start there.Sorry Galen, I'm sure you were a nice guy and everything. Nothing personal.
__label__1 Disappointing: Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and it was totally scratched up!She was very disappointed because she love Bella dancerella items.
__label__1 Ridiculously predictable - could not finish: This book is ATROCIOUS. It is so repetitive and trite. Does Daisy have magical powers? Is James really that "hard"? Is David Jake? And just why is Paul in the story at all? This is a great example of the difference between novelists who evoke feelings and ideas versus those who slam you over the head with a baseball bat (or a wolf bone :))Ick!
__label__1 Other Than the Title it has NOTHING to do with the Transformers: Michael Bay is a hack. They made the whole movie silly and cliche. They gave no personality to the robots at all. The design of the robots was awful. It was hard if not impossible to make out what was going on in the fight scenes. Megatron doesn't even transform into a gun! The product placement was blatant and repeated constantly. It played like a GM commercial. Tried too hard to be funny. Didn't take the franchise seriously. It put the transformers into a typical cliched plot. Normal schmuck comes into contact with something crazy on accident and now the world is in danger and he has to help the robots save the planet while trying to get the hot girl YAWN! The only real Transformers movie ever made was made in 1986.
__label__2 Wealth of Knowledge and Guidance...: Geoff Ingram's book is one of the best Performance-based texts out on the market. Very few books provide the wealth of knowledge that Geoff Ingram does in this book. The sections on SQL tuning and Indexes provided information rarely covered in other Oracle books.What I liked most from this book was Geoff's comments about Oracle and the ISV (Independent Software Vendor). I'm a performance engineer from a respected ISV that primarily uses Oracle as its RDBMS. His commentary was so on about how the ISV in most cases does not understand the role of Oracle in their solution as it relates to tuning...I hope to see more books from Geoff Ingram in the future. It would be nice to see a follow-up book dedicated to SQL tuning...Regards,Steve
__label__1 beware :|: beware :|if you buy an r100 get the supported toshiba cdrw/dvd drive: while you still can :)) otherwise you wont be able to boot a windows cd if u want to re-install operating system rflmao...ie:r100 has no cd drives hahaha...
__label__1 Wonderful Vocals, Poor Video: The quality of the vocals on these discs is superb, probably the greatest recording i've heard of this opera, and one of the best Handel recordings ever. Unfortunately the staging by David McVicars is absured in places and frequently embarassing. The greatest flaw is the poor quality of the video. I have returned two sets so I am assuming they all are of poor quality. I saw this opera in the theater recently and the filming was clear and crisp. The dvd's have poor lighting, vibrating diagonal lines and frequently snowy images.
__label__1 extremely slow shipment: when I was ordering this book, it mentioned 5 to 7 business days. then after almost 1 and half months, I got this package. In the meaning, I tracked the shipment. it was transferred to different locations, even don't know why so simple one book needs to several transfers.I had to write two times to ask where is my book. anyway, I will not buy anything from this company.
__label__1 they stink: my jbuds were a birthday present. After a month of use they just stopped working. ive had cheaper headphones last longer dont buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Another Gear Fab Dud: Gear Fab label is synonymous with boring 60s/70s. There's hardly anything on the label that isn't basic, boring, no-imagination formula grade school level 60s/70s pop-psych/garage psych etc. So if you have a boring life, zero imagination, and are extremely easily entertained, buy every title on that label. You'll be in boring geek heaven. And yes, this one is no exception.
__label__1 Predictable, boring and over-rated: Once you've grasped the main idea the film offers few surprises. The snow sequence is very badly organised, leaving the viewer with little idea of relative positioning of characters during action sequences (as if you even care by this stage). The ending is so predictable as to be insulting. Overrated and dull.
__label__2 I like it!: I am impressed with the Breville quality and inclined to purchase the brand in the future. An extremey well made grill. Easy to clean. Easy to use.I regret that the plates are not reversible, and that with this grill you are always limited to one side a grill, one side a flat griddle. Good thing it is so large. But if the plates were reversible, this thing would really deliver the goods. As it is, excellent quality, good looks, good performance (fast!), and feels like it will last me years.Better plan on giving it counter space, this thing is heavy - too much to be lugging in and out of cupboards for as often as you'll want to us it.
__label__2 An engrossing read about an interesting time and place: This was a well-crafted historic novel about women in the Mughal Empire (what is now Pakistan, Afghanistan and India) several hundred years ago. Characters are engaging, and the intrigues of various attempts at the throne are shown in interesting ways, recalling similar fights for supremacy in England of old. If the test of a novel is that it interests you in the time period and setting, this one is a success.
__label__2 Impressed.: I've been an avid user of Certain Dri PM, and gotten pretty decent results with it. I recently bought this after reading the rave reviews about other users' results, and I must say it works decently well. It does its job, and it doesn't smell bad either. However, I think the deodorant fades somewhat quickly and doesn't last as long as other deodorants I've tried in the past. Good and dependable product overall.
__label__2 Good book, wrong price.: Warren Estabrooks is an icon for Auditory Verbal Therapy, so anyone interested in this approach for deaf children cannot overlook this book. However, as it is listed at $41.95 on the AG Bell site (www.agbell.org), the price listed here must be in error.
__label__2 Excellent: I am very pleased with the book I purchased. The book is in very good condition and it is an enjoyable one to read.
__label__2 The Power of a Praying Wife: This is absolutely wonderful! I have been applying these prayers, even though I am separated right now, I am not sure what is going on, but when I feel the attacks, I know God is working! Praise The Lord! Our God if faithful! He does work on the other side of our mountains. Thank you Stormie! I have your other book as well to change my marriage.
__label__1 SH*T: i saw showbread in concert, and since i was so disgusted by them, i figured i'd at least try their studio recordings to see if they just sucked live. but their studio recording sucks too. a "fresh breath to a world of posers and wannabe bands" posted by some other person on here is complete bullshit. they sound like the standard hardcore band out there. just noise noise noise. if you want REAL musicianship and not just those that are wrecking art into money, try something with originality and TALENT. try the mars volta, mahavishnu orchestra, the fall of troy, mastodon. mastodon is a REAL "hardcore" band, if you may label it such a shitty title.
__label__1 DON'T BUY THIS!: I am the writer who did this interview, and I never gave permission for this to be sold on amazon.com, and I do not receive any royalties for when this is sold. DON'T BUY THIS!!!Thanks,Greg Prato
__label__1 Instructional CD: The CD illustrated the various ways to use the theracane depending on which part of the body was the focus.I believe it should have illustrated more slowly exactly how to use the cane. To review the section needed the entire CD had to be scanned. Pausing it to absorb each maneuver would have been helpful.
__label__2 a helpful guide to developing and maintaining personal boundaries: I found this book to be generally helpful. It is a frill-free guide on how to respect your own space and needs. I would not recommend this book for the folks with an overinflated ego or narcissistic tendencies as it will most likely be a guide to validate their fault behaviour but these people are the unlikely reader of this material anyways.Keeping in mind that this book is most likely to be picked up and read by the folks that are troubled and have a clear lack of assertiveness; it is very useful, concise and clear guide on how to develop and effectively enforce personal boundaries that will restore self-respect and improve relationships with others while maintaining your own integrity.
__label__2 Who picked these games???: Okay, I know we can't get the 60's Packer games, but really, I want to know who picked these games and left out some gems that Packer fans would've loved to see. This collection is missing (in chronological order):1. Chester Marcol's miracle TD against the Bears2. Packers/Cardinals 1982 playoff game (41-16 Packers)3. The "Replay Game" (C'mon, how you can you NOT have that??)4. Favre "closes" County Stadium with a game winning run against the Falcons ('94)5. Favre to Sharpe to beat the Lions in '94 playoffs6. Packers whip the 49ers in the Division Playoffs ('95) 27-17 to show the Pack is Back7. Freeman's Miracle Catch to beat the Vikings 26-20 in OT ('2000)Any of those I would have placed before the '2008 Seattle game and the Bear game.Volume II, please!!
__label__1 extremely disappointed: I bought this crib for my first child, brought it home set it up and within a week of her being in the crib. The bottom bits of the drop part of the railing were coming out and the railing broke. It ended up being unsafe for her and I had to buy another one with better support.
__label__1 Terrible Tech Support; Bad Software: Upon installing the software, a "Runtime Error" occurred with XP that will not allow the QuickCam 10.0 software to run. When I called "Tech Support," I kept getting an out-sourced answering machine. Neither would they reply by email. I would Strongly urge anyone Against purchasing from Logitech until they get their act together.
__label__1 Lacks Focus: The Astors are an iconic American family, rising from immigrant roots to great wealth and aristocratic pretensions, undermined by their own social ambition and self-imposed isolation and finally, in later generations, fading from economic and social prominence. (104 year-old Brooke Astor, the widow of Vincent, is the last multi-millionaire Astor, and will leave no Astor heirs.) Yet this book purports to be, not about the Astors, but about the great hotels that they conceived and built, including such landmarks as the old Waldorf-Astoria, The Astor and the St. Regis. As such, the book lacks focus and is poorly integrated; it's not quite a bio of the Astors, since it's character portraits are superficial, but it's not really about the great hotels either, because it limits that story to the role played by the Astors. The result is disjointed and, occasionally, boring. This author knows alot about the Astors and would have done better to write a straightforward biography or family history.
__label__2 Good Work on New Methodologies: Rev. Groom offers an intermediate Biblical Hebrew student a good view of modern linguistic insight into Biblical interpretation. Developments in lexical semantics and text-linguistics are presented in a readable fashion. She deals with important questions of data, method, and most importantly provides an integrated algorithm for the student who may be confused about how old and new methods fit together.
__label__2 This is a great video, It's True, It's True: Kurt Angle has had a sucessful year to say the least. He has accomplished more in one year in the WWF than most people do in a lifetime. His very own home video takes you throught all of his best moments, from winning the Olympic Gold Medal to Capturing The WWF Title. A Must have for Anyone with the Three I's.
__label__1 Kills my battery: The gauge I recieved has an internal short that causes a 3-4mA drain on my car's battery. The drain dissapears when the gauge is unplugged from it's wiring harness. Spoke to a representative at glowshift and they cannot honor the warranty on the gauge as it was not purchased directly from them. I'll be going with a higher quality autometer or sunpro gauge to replace this one, but beware, if you have a warranty issue and the gauge is not purchased from them directly, they won't replace it.
__label__2 Quick read: Quick, unchallenging, fun, entertaining read.Does not make you think to much, if you need a fast read for a long weekend, then The Traveler will work.Enjoy!
__label__1 This tank is entirely unsatisfactory: I have now purchased six of these and not one has worked long enough for me to adequately invade Poland.The furthest I got in one (the fourth purchased!) was half a mile down the B303, before it broke down outside the local Budgens.Disgusted is not the word.From now on I will seek to undermine their government from within.One star!
__label__1 Please do not watch.: This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life. If you are expecting another classic like "Anchorman" watch another movie. I was terribly dissapointed with Will Ferrell. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!
__label__2 A great product: First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines.But the great thing about these notebooks is not that famous people used them, but that they are of great quality. I highly recommend them.
__label__2 An Overlooked Gem from 1998: Jessica Lange gives one of her strongest performances in this brutally funny revenge story. This period piece has more in common with "Jackie Brown" than it does Merchant-Ivory films. I hope this movie will be rediscovered someday.
__label__1 unhappy: The book I received was obviously used. I was going to give it as a gift for Christmas, but couldn't use it. It was worn and had marks throughout the book. I'll keep it and read it to my grandkids, which is fine, but I was disappointed in the condition of the book.
__label__1 Incomplete: I purchased this product from a contractor supply company in late 2001 but found it to be lacking enough material supports, it also needed an extension to accommodate long lengths. I then ordered the extension assuming that it would come equipped with at least one support. After receiving the extension several weeks later I discovered that DeWalt did not provide additional supports. If I wanted extra supports it was going to cost [price] apiece. I returned the extension but the supply company had to eat the [price] for it because it was special ordered. I like DeWalt tools and I own several of them, but this product is incomplete and the addition of 2 supports at retail price would not be worth the expense. I am a professional carpenter and would not pay DeWalt $1 more for the addition of the supports. I had a machine shop make me two for less than 1/4 of the cost of one of theirs.DO NOT BUY!!!
__label__1 Not Karaoke: As others have mentioned. This is not a karaoke cd. The package labeling says "On-screen Lyrics", but there are none. It is a music CD and the quality is not from the original movie. Apparently all of Disney's "Karaoke" cds are the same way. Disney really had an opportunity to provide a great product for the millions of fans who love the music in the movies and blew it.
__label__1 Amazon movies: I received the Harry Potter Set in decent time. However upon trying to view the movies only 4 of 8 of the DVD's work in my computer. As I live over seas it is not convenient for me to return the set to get a replacement.
__label__1 Not worth it: I ordered two other Dvds with this one and Brainy Baby-Spanish was the best. It kept my 23 month old engaged, while 123 Cuentame un Cuento is a bit advanced and Galloping Minds -- I did not care for at all -- anyone can hold up flash cards! In any event, Brainy Baby-Spanish was worth the buy. I am a spanish speaking mother who wanted to find a good product for my daughter while I am at work so she may study the language while she is at home since my sitter only speaks limited spanish. Thank you Brainy Baby!
__label__1 Definitive ? No.: I bought this book at the Royal Festival Hall before a Brian Wilson show, summer 2004, flicked it open - and immediately, big problem: the social security number of pretty much everyone who ever played on a Beach Boys record 1961-1968 is printed.Reading more, later and at leisure, another big problem emerged - the bulk of the diary is composed of the work of other writers, both on the web and in print media, copied almost word for word and without adequate credit (and yes, here I'll confess a vested interest - the post 1976 year summaries are largely lifted from my own BB website, uncredited of course).That said, it's a reasonable overview of the band 1961-1976, and there are many excellent new photos... but there's also much inaccurate information, many myths are repromoted. So, definitive ? Not by a long chalk.
__label__2 Fantastic evening: This is a fantastic concert and the occasion fully deserved it being released on DVD...It's heart warming to see Ch. Ludwig, G. Janowitz and some other VSO Kammersängern and Kammersängerinen watch as guests and it's thrilling to see the public tossing bouquets to VSO super stars such as Gruberova and Baltsa....The VSO in festive mood is worth watching!
__label__2 Completely out there!!!: I am a big fan of the "Gears". Having read all their books, I really was looking forward to a series. I have not been disappointed. The Visitant and this one fell right into place, although they could do without the modern day chapters. They are weak and not really that good. If the authors were just to skip them it would be great. I look forward to the next in the series.
__label__1 Slow start to no place: While I have enjoyed many of Chriton's books (inspite of the fact that he does not know how to plausibly end a good story) this one holds little enjoyment. A ten page essay on the misunderstandings of global warning would have saved me the many hours it took to plow through this book. The story takes 250 pages to get going and constantly wanders through lectures on the ignorance of environmentalists. While the point may be valid in some ways the plot seems to be simply a guise to preach this point. There is no tension, no spark, no reason to care about any of the characters in the story or in fact in the world they are supposedly trying to save. The State of Fear is never developed. As a thriller it is empty and thrilless. As an environmental statement it is 550 pages to long. I won't give up on him for this book but it was a waste of $8.00 and 15 hours.
__label__1 Horribly Formatted, Words?: If you haven't yet bought this book for your Kindle, don't. The formatting is terrible (tiny picture on big screen, crazy 5 step zoom), and the book is only pictures. You have been warned...
__label__2 Lost is Found: I had been looking for a roaster for years and found the exact one I was looking for and for an excellent price & it arrived is pristine condition. My old roster was inherited from my Grandmother after she passed away and had used for many years. It was passed being used for the kitchen.
__label__1 Useless: I'm giving this 2 stars because I didn't get any untoward side effects, but I felt no different after taking this supplement for several weeks.
__label__2 my text book in fidm: this is the book for 'textile science' and we still use it as reference in 'fabric id'. i have never read another textile book. so no comparison. since FIDM have been using this book for a while, i guess this can't be bad
__label__2 Awesome: I have sacroiliac dysfunction due to repetitive stress (competitive rowing). This belt has allowed me to perform rigorous activities that would normally cause tremendous pain e.g. construction, shoveling snow. I've been wearing this brand with very heavy use for eight years (on my third). Very comfortable/adjustable. I highly recommend this product to those suffering si dysfunction (caveat: pending approval from your physician/DC... of course).
__label__2 Good book, but came with tears: I love the book, and it was shipped very quickly. My only complaint is that there were tears on the cover/back cover and inside the book as well.
__label__2 Quality Piece Of Work!: Let me just say that I am a true fan of nearly all Bruce and Stan's work, so it came as no surprise to me that I thoroughly enjoyed their take on making the most of one's life. The main ideas stressed within the covers are positivity, inspiration, Divinity, and setting goals for oneself. Going through all the majorly important areas of one's life -- career, relationships, finances, Spiritual Walk, goals, etc. -- they manage to help you cope with changes, including disappointment. I've found this work has helped me cope with some difficult transitions and has given me a completely new perspective on exactly what success means. Check out this book if you need a fresh view of things. You will not be disappointed.
__label__2 Almost perfect: This is easily the best vacuum I have ever used. It picks up all particles in its way on the first sweep. The bare floor setting replaces the broom as it is thorough and easy to use. I use the bare floor setting for going over light weight rugs. It does not eat them up or damage them. The hose is powerful and easy to use. The exaust puts out clean air and doesn't smell like my dog. I am very happy with the purchase, however, I wish the vacuum were a bit smaller. It is heavy (the rolling brushes push it along, so it is not hard to push) and so bulky that it doesn't fit in between many things. But, for the price, esspecially, I am not complaining.
__label__2 Now I can read anytime anywhere!: I love my new Kindle! I admit the enthusiasm from Oprah did sway me a bit, but I thought I would give it a try. It was easy to set up and use, and best of all lots of free Kindle books available from various sites, all you have to do is "google" free Kindle books, and up they pop! When I travel it is not 3-4 books, but just one sleek, light weight Kindle, I am over the moon! I must admit, I think it could be a bit less expensive, which is for reasons that it puts it in a category where everyone cannot afford it, and my other feedback is that Kindle books on Amazon should be less than the $9.00 which I believe is a bit steep for an electronic copy. The speed in which a book gets delivered is amazing and almost magical, and I am definitely a walking commercial for the product!
__label__1 This man is dangerous: I was briefly involved with "Sir John Q" many years ago, until he crossed the boundaries of safety and frightened me away from him and the "scene" forever.He did not respect "safe" words in the end, and is more emotionally damaged than many of the women he describes in the book. I also believe that some of the book is sheer fantasy.That said, much of my experience with Q was exhilirating and exciting and the first chapter especially was an intelligently written and eye-opening look into the BDSM scene.
__label__1 Terrible!: For some reason Consumer Reports rated this thermometer fabulously. Our experience with it has been the opposite. We have a one year old baby and it takes forver (as in minutes) to get a reading.
__label__1 Unable to play Blu-Ray on PS3 without Firmware 3.51: This review is not on the movie -- I have not viewed it yet.The Blu-Ray will not play on PS3 without a firmware update. Required firmware update removes features from the PS3. I hope this aids anyone deciding to make this purchase, although I am sure the future holds many more of these types of requirements for Blu-Rays on PS3.Side Note: nobody in the household wanted to watch the movie in DVD instead even though the package includes a DVD.<Update>The minimum required PS3 system version is 3.51 to watch this Blu-Ray. After careful consideration, I installed the latest PS3 system version 3.60 and was able to play the Blu-Ray. The flack appears to be that 3.21 and newer takes away feature 'Install Other OS' which we determined we would not use.</Update>
__label__1 flaking: Not what I had expected for the price. I think that I feel better about using the $.99 plastic scoop. The coating has been flaking off since receiving the scoop. It was a gift that I would like to return or exchange.
__label__2 Simply Superb: Ashkenazy is at the top of his form in these wonderful performances, bringing depth, insight, and clarity to the music. The Concertgebouw Orchestra is the perfect counterpart and is much better than the London Symphony Orchestra in Ashkenazy's other recording of the concerti. Ashkenazy's pianism is not only technically flawless but exhilarating -- even intoxicating -- as he plunges heart and soul into the music.These are terrific performances by one of the greatest pianists and orchestras of the 20th century and will bring you many hours of listening pleasure. Simply superb!
__label__1 more expensive than direct subscription: Go to McSweeney's own site and get a lower subscription price, without any sale or combo applied. This is ridiculous.
__label__2 A must have book for anyone learning Spanish: It is difficult to learn another language if you do not fully understand your own. This author explains subjuctive, past perfect and etc. in terms easy to understand. Thus, the author puts English and Spanish sentences side-by-side for easy comparison. I love it and wish I had this book when I was in school.
__label__2 Love 80s dance and modern dance? You'll LOVE this CD....: This is one of the hottest CDs if you're into the retro-electro sound. You'll swear David Gahan is singing songs like `In Love With Myself' and `The World is Mine', The mellow "new wave" feeling `Time' sounds like it borrowed a synthesizer (and riff) off Ministry's "with sympathy" CD. Stereo MC's make a guest appearance on the downtempo house thumper `Open Your Eyes', `Higher' is like a synth pop dance track you'd hear on an Anything Box CD--but with a Simply Red-esque vocal. `Get Up' is a total rock/electro house hybrid--reminds me of an arena rock production you'd hear on an 80s soundtrack like "Top Gun." This is a must have if you're into recent stuff by Infernal, The Moderns, Lasgo, etc....
__label__1 The Love of a stranger: My wife bought the song first and it touched her and when she saw the movie on TV I watched it with her and it was very moving. This little boys Mom was dying and didn't have much time to buy these shoes that he knew she would look good in when she went to meet God. I won't tell what happens, but it showed me that no matter what we think is important that there is always someone that is going through pain that is deeper then ours..It shows that when someone needs help and if we can help them in any way then we should, without knowing the reason why, then maybe when we get to heaven or even down our road, we will be blessed..It was only a pair of shoes on sale, but they were worth a million to a little boy..Anyone who has lost someone dear to them will understand this desperate need and love those red shoes brought..
__label__1 False Advertising: The cooking surface of this grill/griddle is 16.5" x 8.5". Not 19 1/4" x 8.5" as stated. That 2.75" makes a considerable difference.
__label__2 Left Behind will take your imagination away: I am never that much of a reader. I have to admit that I picked up the book just for a school project for my English class. Oh great, another book to read. I open up the page and it is actually so hard to put down. I mean that has never happened to me before. And since i have heard of when Jesus and God will return for his people, the book makes the reality of what will happen come to such reality. If you are a christian and if you are not, you should still read this book because it is very real and very well created. Wonderful work by Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.
__label__1 You get what you pay for: This is a terrible product. I sat right in front of the transmitter and the hissing noise was overwhelming. The build of both the headphones and docking station felt cheap. And placing the headphones on the dock was a challenge. I returned these immediately.
__label__1 Hitchcock music: I was not impressed with this CD. The preview provided did not really give an accurate view of this product. The music overall, is average, and Hitchcock speaks over a lot of it... Not at all what I expected or needed for background music/sounds for a play... Disappointed, and never used any of it...
__label__1 CHEEP: This hood looks good on a computer screen but not in a kitchen.The corners are not welded,that big black plastic piece in the middle looks horable and bugs the $*** out of me.I thing im going to sell it on CL and get a quality hood.You get what you pay for!!!
__label__2 Exactly what I need: This is exactly what I wanted, I'm a city boy. So I really don't need the coat for the heaviest weather. However there is still some weather to go through. I've worn it all winter and only had my hoodie beneath for warmth. I even went sledding in it and never got wet. The smell was strong and in fact my dog had his tail between his legs when I first took it out. But after a liberal wash with the hose and some time its undetectable. I'm completely satisfied with the coat.
__label__1 No hummingbirds!: After breaking my cheap Walmart humming bird feeder (hummingbirds did use) I purchased this hummingbird feeder. Not a single hummingbird has come in over 3 weeks despite the fact that I have hummingbird plants around it and change the solution every 4 days
__label__2 More Sparrow, please: Not as awesomely awesome as Volume One, but there's still enough Calypso wit on these tracks to repel many a pretender to the throne. The mix is way better than Volume One, so this one hits your ears without any historical filter... at least in the quality of the mix. Austin Powers and the Oceans Eleven crew must have learned some of their moves here.
__label__1 Disappointing: Not what I had hoped for. I love Cowboy Mouth and never miss a chance to see them in concert, but there newest album isn't up to par with me. They need to go back to their roots.
__label__1 Not very powerful: I liked this that was vacuum was small. However, it is not nearly powerful enough to clean any type of electronic.
__label__2 Helpful Gluten Free DVD: I was totally overwhelmed when my 2-year old was first diagnosed with celiac. I'd never heard of the disease before. The dvd helped me not only understand what it's like to live gluten free but also to see normal people doing every day things as they pertain to celiac. I especially like being able to watch just the part I'm interested in at the moment - like shopping or eating out - without having to watch the entire dvd. I would highly recommend it especially for newly diagnosed parents or even kids who want to know they're not alone.
__label__1 A STEP BACKWARD IN TIME: I did not realize that Wouk is 90. I guess, at that age, this book is " acceptable ". But, otherwise the only words applicable are mawkish, awkward, clunky, predictable;maybe, even embarrasssing; you take my meaning.As Ebert and Roeper are wont to say "two thumbs down, way down".Memory brings back the "War ---" books and Marjorie Morningstar.I read them when they first appeared; and liked them alot. That gives away my age.Good luck, Herman. We are brothers.
__label__1 Geddy, I couldn't hear your voice.: You have no idea how bad sounds this dvd. If you love Rush, please don't buy it.
__label__1 Matthew Henry Bible Commentary: This is a heavy book containing extremely valuable information, it's a classic. However, the print is very small and too difficult to spend time reading.
__label__2 A Nuclear Assault!!: Think you've heard just about every breakdown there is? Think again, my friend. The Classic Struggle bring the breakdowns to a new level. Clever off-time beats with intelligent intricacies. Think of the sounds of machine guns and thunder and your almost there. This is death/metalcore at its best. FOR FANS OF: Through the Eyes of the Dead, 7 Angels 7 Plagues,ect.
__label__2 It was very mysterious touching.: One day Sals mother left them to go visit cousins in Lewiston,Idaho.There were lots of mysteries throughout the book that you wanted to know.But you didnt find out till the end.A couple of different people died throughout the book.If you want to know you have to read it yourself.
__label__2 No Need To Argue: The second Cranberries album is a very,very good. There are several classics on this album. I could listen to songs like I Can't Be With You, Zombie and Ridiculous Thoughts again and again.When I go into my father's car I insist on listening to the songs I've mentioned. The single reason I slightly disagree a few other Cranberries fans who rate this the band's best album is that there are a couple of songs that do not live up to the usual high standard. Their first album is more consistent so that I've rated 5 star and this album 4 star.
__label__2 Revolutionary...: This album changed my mind about "hardcore" (which the Huskers say good-bye to from here on out, excluding the B-Side if one thinks of the original double LP).It's a shame that this, New Day Rising, and Flip Your Wig (a trilogy that's the 80s alternative rock equivalent of Bringing It All Back Home-Highway 61 Revisited-Blonde On Blonde) are legally hoarded by SST. They each deserve the 3-disc 5.1 remaster treatment.
__label__2 Non Pop Up Umbrella Drain: Drain looks great with my new Decolav vessel sink and matches my faucet. Plumber had no problem installing drain and it fit the sink perfectly.
__label__2 This song has a special place in my heart...: This song means alot to me. I had seen the Mitsubishi commercial but apparently hadn't paid much attention to the song, which is strange since music is the first thing that grabs my attention. Then I heard the song playing on the radio and one of my close friends was really into the song, so it peaked my attention, and I kind of took a liking to it. It is VERY catchy after all, besides being very mezmerizing, and it kind of sucks you in. Anyway beside the great beat and catchy melodies, I can relate completely to the lyrics. So whenever I hear that song....I think of her.....
__label__1 Disappointed: Duos II turned out to be a real disappointment. It takes you on a boring journey to total boredom which eventually puts the listener to sleep. She is no Astrud Gilberto.
__label__2 Extraordinary blend of photography and words: Ryerson's extraordinary photography blends with the words of 66 renowned musicians to provide a gorgeous (and I do not use that word lightly) fusion of image and thought. But this is far more than another coffee table book. The proceeds of Ryerson's work benefit the United Nations Foundation in support of sustainable water resources throughout the world. The reasonable price of this book is surprising considering its exceptional publication quality and its size.
__label__2 PRETTY COOL: Ok...this phone is great! I recently upgraded it from a moto v180(screen went blank...would barley start up!...friends went through 3 of them!) and i must say...it overall is a very good phone.It has the typical camera that you would find for any phone on the market today.Reason for 4 stars...they have M Mode shortcuts for the internet EVERYWHERE!!!-t0m
__label__1 a piece of junk: 1. jam at least twice for the period that i used it ( shooting less than 200 brats )2. stop working after using it for less than a week3. made in China4. Since it came with the makita compressor i can't return for refund. So i returned it to amazon for replacement. Amazon refuse to replace it.5. the nailer doesn't deserve a star. However i have to give it one so that amazon will publish my review
__label__1 TRIUMPH OVER TRAGEDY: I CAN NOT GIVE YOU A REVIEW BECAUSE I ORDERED THE BOOK ON FEB.1,2002 AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. TODAY'S DATE IS FEB. 15,2002.
__label__2 Fun good movie, typical ending: This movie was much better than I thought it would be and I would watch it again or recommend it. However, they took this great plot and stuck a cookie-cutter ending on it. Not bad, just not fitting with the rest of the movie.
__label__1 Worthless product in our home: Considering that some people have actually raved about this product, perhaps there is just a difference in the pet's hair that makes it work for some and not for others.I tried it on both of our cats who have been heavily and continuously shedding. I got next to nothing off their coats with this brush. Then I used a cheap rubber slicker brush from Walmart and got gobs out. It sounds wonderful but sure didn't work for us. I was glad that I got a refund because it was a big waste of money and time.
__label__2 Soooo good: I love all of the Haribo flavors, but this has to be my favorite. The consistency is a little denser than other gummi candies - which I really like. This flavor tastes like cola (with a touch of caramel) which has helped me cut back on my soda intake.
__label__2 Great product: The item arrived in good shape and on time. The anniversary edition has a great "making of" bonus that I have really enjoyed watching.
__label__2 Sherlock Season 1: Sherlock Season 1- The acting is superb. The story lines are well written, bringing the tails of Sherlock into the 21 century. The only thing that I can begin to fault is that there are not enough of them. Please keep up the good work!
__label__1 Failure: I saw Malkin on TV and I couldn't believe that a professional political analyst could sound ike such a fool. What could be worse? Her book! I give this two stars because she tries, but that's just being generous. If you must read, use your public library.
__label__2 The BEST book I've ever read!: I'm a sophomore in highschool and I'm also a extremely dedicated cross-country and track runner. This book has changed my life! The inspirational story of Quenton Cassidy's runner career left me breathless! The first chapter gave me goose-bumps because it decribed the start of a race perfectly. I read chapters from the book every night before a big race. Reading about Cassidy's determination gives any runner a boost. This book has to have the most accurate description of a runners mentality ever written. This is the best book about running I've ever read!
__label__2 Fun!: I'm in agreement with the other reviewers -- it's not her best (my opinion is that "Riders" and "Polo" are). That said, I think it's an excellent escapist novel! It's not really fair comparing it to "Riders" -- the first is always the best. Lysander is a fun and different hero -- he may not be as smart or as witty as the leading men in previous works (like Rupert) but he has a charming innocence despite the "job" he's been hired to do of making womens' husbands jealous! He has a genuine sweetness that shines through. And don't skip over this book in the order of things like another reviewer suggested. It comes after "Polo" and should be read that way!
__label__1 latitude..d600: the battery is not working i waste my time and money on this products next time i will just buy the original one
__label__2 Works very well!: No where in my house was I able to get hot or warm water without waiting a fair amount of time. After reading the reviews here I initially bought just the valve to see if it would work by itself as suggested in one of the reviews. It did not. Then I purchased the item described here, pump and valve, at Costco for $180. What a difference! Because of the layout of my house I needed 2 valves so my experiment with just a valve did not wast any money. The hot water at the valve could be hotter and the cold water could be colder - obviously mutually exclusive. The faucets upstream from the valve have much hotter water and this is an obvious but unexpected treat. It is nice to have something that works better than expected. I definitely recommend the Watts Premier Hot Water Recirculation Pump.
__label__2 great read: just finished on my kiindle and unlike some here i was not disappointed. the pace is a bit slower than the others but no less entertaining. glad i am a latecomer to the series as i can hardly wait for the fifth installment next month...i need my tyrion fix.
__label__1 Fun computer but not such a gr8 experience...: I have been a PC user for over a decade. I got so bored of it and so decided to try the Macbook. All worked great for first two weeks and then I decide to try playing a DVD for the first time. Found a few scratches on the disc... and decided to try another disc and the same result.Finally took it to an Apple store to get a replacement but they instead offered repair service because it was 18 days instead of 14days. The store Rep's were rude and arrogant and very strict about their policies. Ofcourse, the problem existed all along because I found this during the first DVD use. They promised 5 days service... but its already 4 days and the website says "On Hold" because parts are on order. I find the same rudeness with the reps on the phone.I like the Mac though but just the product quality and customer service has prompted me to downgrade the rating.
__label__1 Grotesque Propaganda: In an appalling work of heartless provocation, Truscott uses a Russian tragedy, in which 118 men died, to demonise Russia. There can be few things lower - to take a nation's tragedy and use it as justification to attack it. And like most British books on Russia (and to a lesser extent, America), Truscott uses his spiteful magnum opus as a lecture on how allegedly morally superior the English are over Russians and other ethnic groups. This kind of intolerance drove many non-English Britons to emigrate in the 1960s.
__label__2 Great investment: This package cost less than 1 haircut for my husband - and he was getting them every 3 weeks. He likes the way his hair looks when I cut it with these just as well as the salon cut, and it's really cut down on cost for us.The Good:- The guards work well - I have used multiple combinations to create different looks- We haven't had any trouble with nicks or pinching- The blades seem to be staying plenty sharpA few small complaints:- the cord isn't quite long enough, in my opinion- some of the guards don't have rounded tips and my husband has told me that they aren't as comfortable to use as the ones that do
__label__1 Easy Prey -- The end of the series?: I love John Sandford books. This is the exception. Introducing a new character in the last few pages and having that character be an important part of the book is unfair. The thrill is in the clues and the chase -- not the quick and meaningless ending. I hope the next book shows more or the originality exhibited in Sandford' earlier books. I will read the next book with a bit of reluctance.
__label__1 Eat the big fish or jump the big shark?: I know there are some good strategic ideas here but I was incredibly put off by the misinformation right up front about people's media habits and media consumption patterns across media. the data is incredibly wrong, such as the relative time on the internet vs watching TV (as a media industry expert I know what is considered to be gold standard measures) so the book is a bit of a house of cards. anyone can contact me at joel@rubinsonpartners.com for more specifics.
__label__2 Still Good After Time: After 12 years this cd without adoubt one of the best, even without Kurt Cobain here he lives on through Nirvana's music. I only have one thing to say if you dont have it BUY IT.Everytrack on this cd comes ripping from you cd player hitting you in the face with hard guitar riffs, buy it you will love it.
__label__1 Why buy a medical product that comes without directions?: As others have identified in their reviews, this medical product arrives without directions. The directions on Amazon's website are poor. A consumer should not have to get advice on how to use a medical product by Googling a questions!
__label__2 Another Gemmell Masterpeice: You all ways hear about David Gemmell writing in the Tradition of Howard and Tolkin But the simple fact is that his storys are much much better. I can not remmember reading one of his books where at some point I was not moved to tears and another where I was awed by the power and heroism. A great Book with many points of intrest to waylander fans{and who isn't a waylander fan} it ended a bit quick for my tastes people should read the first two books to get the full impact but still the best fanstasy this year.
__label__1 What happened?: Spacegodzilla looks too fake with the crystals and Godzilla is fat. Baby godzilla is kinda cute for small kids but thism ovie reminded me too much of godzilla vs. Megalon becuase it had that campy humor of a space alien. Spacegodzilla was too easy to kill and should appear in more godzilla movies. Space godzilla should be redesigned with his crystals and fins. A little mOthra appears for little reason and the effects are horrible. What was Toho thinking with this story? It was presentated wrong and it lacked visual effects
__label__1 You get what you pay for!: After just a few uses, the bottom inside of the pot started peeling and left black junk all over the pasta....yuck! I paid under $20 for it so I guess it's true....you get what you pay for. I liked the idea of a pot and colander in one, so I'm going to invest in a quality pot.
__label__2 Dead Sea Scrolls Deception: Highly recommended but can take time to read. It involves so much information so make sure you read in it in a quiet and non-invasive environment to get full benefit from it.
__label__2 Hawk Performance Brake Pads: I purchased these as a component for a complete brake system upgrade on my 1988 Fiero GT. The pads are every bit as good as advertised if not better! Stopping power is excellent, fade is virtually non-existant, and they produce almost no dust to foul your wheels. Although costly, they are worth every penny!
__label__1 This cd was ok: This cd was pretty good if you like classical music by the composers. Not the best though.
__label__1 Full of Empty Schmaltz!!!: I hated this movie! I went to see it expecting it to be a nice story. So, a horse gets kidnapped and gets back home-BIG WHOOP! It wouldn't happen. The plot was bland and too politically correct for my taste. Horses aren't that smart, either. They wouldn't know that railroads would be built in their territory. And what is Spirit? A super horse? Horses are strong, but they're not James Bond. Besides, these horses had eyebrows and they whinnied too much. The "wild and free" thing is sentimental and insipid junk! WORST MOVIE EVER!!
__label__1 Failed After 1 Month: This item failed after one month of use.There seem to be two breakers in this item:The first one is tied to the "reset" button. This circuit is closest to the shared socket side.The second one is tied to the "on/off switch". This circuit is closest to the wall side.The on/off switch is still lit up.However, none of the devices are getting power. The Reset button is useless and does not work.This item will be returned.
__label__2 KILLER BAND.....BUY THIS!!!: I bought this cd because Tombstone Radio is out of print(at least a new copy anyway)and I'm familiar with most of the songs on this disc anyway,so this was a no-brainer in getting it..Let me tell you,this is one killer band!! Great songs...How come they're not opening up for Aerosmith or not at Ozzfest??? These guys need a bigger audience.....songs on the radio and so on...More exposure!!...GET THIS IF YOU LIKE HIGH ENERGY ROCK AND ROLL.....IT SURE BEATS MOST OF THE BANDS ON MTV AND VH1 RIGHT NOW ANYWAY!!!.....
__label__1 100%Crap: This movie was horrible please don't buy this movie it is so retarted please don't waist your time watching this movie. I really wish I could give this 0 stars.
__label__1 Lots half the water when it tipped over for a couple of minutes.: the bottle easily tips over and the water leaks every wear. Only good for the cup holder in my car.
__label__2 Awesome Product: Like all Doug & Melissa toys, this is another high quality item. Well built, sturdy construction and very easy to assemble. Unlike some plastic models, this one is really stable and difficult to tip over. Love the three adjustable height options. Low enough for my 2 year old granddaughter to use now, and it will be years before she outgrows it. We did not experience any problems with the chalk showing up on the chalkboard like a few users did, but we used crayola sidewalk chalk. The trays are nice and deep to hold lots of chalk and crayons, but don't stick out so far as to interfere with the child using the board. Also love that all of the screw ends are covered with plastic covers to prevent injuries.
__label__1 Recieved this item damaged...: It's hard for me to decide how to rate this product. Since I have had this flavor before, I know that they are tasty and my 10 yr old loves them. However, the chocolate bars were discolored as though they had melted at some point in a warehouse or while being delivered. I had open several of the bars and all were damaged. Thankfully Amazon.com has made it easy to refund my money, and I am a happy camper. I had ordered a box of the Cookies & Cream and they were not damaged. Just thought I would give others the heads up...
__label__2 The Best in Classical Education: The BEST home schooling book I have read so far. I want to share it with everyone I know. You won't be sorry you spent the money.
__label__2 Great bed time story: Love to read this one to my 15 month old daughter before bed. She loves the kisses part. She has me reread that part so she gets extra kisses. Very cute story.
__label__2 "Life's Aquarium" is fantastic!!: I am a long-time fan of Mint Condition, and have all of their CD's, but "Life's Aquarium" not only shows their immense musical talents, but also shows how they have matured as songwriters, producers and musicians. This CD is pure class!! The sexuality that is portrayed in the songs is not overdone and crass. It is enticing and tastefully done. The variety of music on any M.C. CD is sure to please, and this disc is no different. These guys are new-jack R&B at its best, and sets a high standard for other bands to aspire to. This CD would be a solid purchase for M.C. fans or fans of great, quality music. BUY IT! (P.S.: Check the end of the CD for the hidden track!!)
__label__2 Zombies and character development what's not to love!!!!!: Anyone who loves a good apocalyptic story, they're gonna love this show. The zombies are simply the cause, what makes it great is how the characters are written, and performances from the actors. It leaves you wondering, would I have reacted any better? Would I have made a different choice?
__label__2 Great film music.: Victor Young was one of a handful of top composers of film scores during Hollywood's Golden Age. His scores were all very melodious and quite apt for the films with which they were associated. Extended excerpts of two of his best scores -- Shane and Sampson and Delilah -- are presented on this disc. Also presented is his Academy Award winning theme for Around the World in 80 Days plus Stella by Starlight from The Uninvited and My Foolish Heart from the film of the same name. I suspect that oustanding film music such as is presented on this disc will still be around when much allegedly more serious music from the 20th century is forgotten. I highly recommend this CD.
__label__1 Smithsonian Earth soft bound book: Although this is a fantastic book, after about a month of normal use, the pages are coming out of the binding!
__label__1 When Will You Learn?: Paramount is doing the same thing with the Star Trek movies on BD, hoping you'll buy the theatrical release, then buy it again when the director's cut is out. Well, not this time. Once burned shame on you, twice burned shame on me. Just wait for the version you want.
__label__1 Snore: The Postman was way too long, boring, and the plot was quite, well, pathetic. Sorry, this movie sinks as low as a movie can sink. I admire Kevin Costner's performances, but even he couldn't save this snoozer. The Postman is a movie not worth making in the first place. I left the movie theater halfway through the movie and got my money back, and waited for HBO to air it to see the end. I shouldn't have watched the end, you can tell what it is at the halfway mark in the movie. The plot is so incredibly thin that it makes the plot of Bloodsucking Freaks look ingenious, and that's not saying much. If you can't stand boring, plotless movies (who can...) don't see this (this means EVERYONE! DON'T SEE IT!)
__label__1 did not work at all: 3 cats, hours, days, weeks , months wasted and all my kittens hate it!!I tried everything possible and it did not work! It taught my cats to drink water from the toilet bowl, now I have to be sure that all toilet bowls in the house are closed otherwise the cats want to drink from them.
__label__1 Not her best work, and not for children.: Robin McKinley is my favorite author, and I was very disappointed in this book. I bought it not only for myself, but for my kids, and let them read it first. Neither said much about it, and I was surprised until I read it myself. The story is disturbing and of sufficiently adult content that I would not categorize this as a children's book. It is also not as well-written as her other books. There were even some sentences that I had to read a few times just to get the correct meaning. I loved the illustrations, but didn't like the story. Not too many nine to twelve-year-olds will get the point of this story -- I'm not so sure I did myself.
__label__2 Great for Beginners: This book is great for beginners or someone looking for new stitches. The patterns aren't of high interest to me but the stitches will help me design my own stuff. Well organized and easy to find what I'm looking for.
__label__1 no distance focus: The paperwork included in this package shows a center distance focus.It says to focus left eye, then right eye and then use center knob to focus for distance.There Is not center knob to focus.
__label__1 Do not read this book.: This is the only book I've read about poker that I haven't liked. The whole book just tells over and over again how good Antonio is at poker.
__label__1 A pretty bumpy ride: After enjoying its loose sequelHi, Mom!, I decided to give this one a try. This is basically just a scattershot series of sketches centering around its three main characters, and only a handful of them really stick. As one might guess, De Niro's scenes are definitely the most memorable, particularly a funny scene involving his attempt at an erotic photo shoot with a girl. The rest of the scenes just meander without producing very many laughs. Plus, the subject matter and style feel very dated, and not in a good way. Also, the amateurish quality makes it pretty clear that De Palma hadn't quite found his feet by this point yet. The follow-upHi, Mom!is absolutely worth checking out though.
__label__1 EXODUS DOES NOT WORK. LEADERS ADMIT IT!: Michael Busse (co-founder of Exodus), Darlene Bogle (a former Exodus ministries leader), and Jeremy Marks (former Exodus International and head of Courage UK) issue a public and formal apology for their work as ex-gay leaders and the harm they caused to those they tried to help.They joined Beyond Ex-Gay and Soulforce at an Ex-Gay Survivors Conference at UC-Irvine later that week[....][...]
__label__1 not her best: I am a huge Bertrice Small fan and own every single one of her books but this is easily my LEAST favorite and the only one I have only read once. It was flat and boring compared to her other work with little of the exquisite detail that I have come to appreciate. If you are just starting to read Ms. Small's work please start with something else, like the wonderful Kadin or any of the early Skye O'Malley series!
__label__2 Java's best friend: Exellent quality. Does the job of keeping hot coffee hot throughout the day. On off switch is a plus also.
__label__2 Daughters of the Moon Tarot: I have used this deck for over 12 years now (I actually have a pen and ink deck--not colored), and although it DEFINITELY takes some time to get to "know" and work with the energies and symobology, it is well worth it. My experiences working with this deck- for myself and others--have been unerringly accurate, and I truly appreciate the subtlties that the round deck presents in interpretation. I have found it difficult, if not simply impractical, to try and read men with the deck--its just not meant for them and that's fine with me!! I certainly can, but generally do not like to do this. The imagery is global and inclusive, and the symbology is strikingly accurate at the deeper levels. This is my primary deck for workings and readings, and highly recommended for any open to the radical feminism and sheer power of it!! Definitely get the "Wild Witches..." book to go with it.
__label__1 please,already,just make a super mario sunshine 2: i saw this on a demo.it looked great,so i bought it.I liked.8 worlds,8 episodes(except corona mountain).you get to deal with big guy(eg:mecha bowser,gooper blooper).you get bunch of jumps like triple jumps,spin jumps,don't waste your money.(as always like other 5 star reviews,buy this game with the bundle pak).you won't be mad.i've gave it two stars because.they write"too bad",and his voice when he jumps(ya,ma).
__label__1 What a load of bunk!: There's an unbelievable amount of distortion of medical facts in this book. There is also some good advice. Yes insulin is an important physiological factor in gaining weight and high glycemic-sugary-foods trigger this hormone,but the overal gestalt of this book is pretty much mass media nonsense. High carbohydrate diets ,when composed correctly, are incontestably the most healthful of all diets. We have about four fifths of the human race to verify that. The bottom line is:IF YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT,EAT LESS. There's no magic about it. The lazy crowd will forever be in search of tne magic,effortless formula. Hence, the popularity of this book.
__label__2 cogg: it took forever to recieve the movie. i guess it was out of stock, but it would have been nice to have had some communication with the seller. i frinally wrote the seller only to find out it was coming in that day and would be shipped.
__label__2 Really Good Read if you are into Alcatraz: Really enjoyed the book. A lot of liberties were taken in this book regarding facts of the story but she did a pretty good job in my opinion from the evidence that is there. I still think West chickened out and wasn't left behind as he states it. All those characters are sure pieces of work. I eat this Alcatraz stuff up and read as much as I can. I'm still trying to find good internet pictures of the old Alcatraz (with all buildings still on the Parade Grounds and the Warden's House still intact) but they are very difficult to find. When searching, all you see are pictures of how it looks now. There has got to be some good high quality pictures of the old Alcatraz somewhere.
__label__1 Very small....: This is like the size of a 4x6 card. Really, it is that small. So if you want a pocket sized notebook, fine. Otherwise, do not buy it.
__label__2 We are enjoying this!: I read the bad reviews and it took me a while to decide to get this or not. I almost didn't! I'm so glad I finally bought this as we are really enjoying watching this.Ok, it's not as good as the movie and it's a little stiff in some places and the acting is a bit over the top in some parts and the stories are not perfect, but it IS funny! We love watching the familiar characters and it's been fun passing some time both laughing and grimacing at them.
__label__1 In amazon.co.uk u can get this for LESS THAN $20.00: Don't be a fool. buy this set for less than $20 from amazon.co.uk in which u can also find the complete season 6 for just 16 uk pounds.Why dynasty dvd's are delayed in north america is beyond my imagination.
__label__1 You WILL regret buying this!!: I know that if you are a die hard fan of Tool then you may find yourself very tempted to buy this. DO NOT!! All the reviews are true. This video should be made manditory viewing for film school students on how NOT to produce a biography!! ... Words can not express how disappointing this biography is.
__label__2 One of the best cartoons ever: when i was gowing up this was one of my all time favorate cartoon. For me it was just full of fun. You dont find cartoons like Inspector Gadget. I am so glad it is now on DVD.
__label__1 too "modern" ideas were inserted in Betsy: It will appeal to young female teens but the historical setting and female perspective will alienate many teens, especially reluctant readers. Also I several issues with the story itself: first it was slow reading until the middle, second even though it is historical fiction I felt that too many "modern" ideas were inserted in Betsy and several of the other characters, some of those issues would not have been dealt with in that matter, especially the frankness of sex and premarital sex, at that, lastly the lack of historical accuracy when dealing with actual events and people always poses an issue with me. I feel that there should be some responsibility and accountability for truth even in fiction; particularly when Betsy attempts to help "Boney" escape even at the cost of another's life, the author even admits that there is no evidence for this.
__label__2 Very humorous book, perfect for child's first chapter book: A girl comes home from school with a few things that happened to her that day (none of them good) and the mother chuckles, and goes to tell her daughter what a day SHE has had. You will be chuckling more and more as the day goes on and she describes all the silly things (all very realistic) that happened to her. A real cute story that is also good for a beginning chapter book reader. It's small, interesting, and is enjoyable for children and adults both.
__label__2 it is a great book: I bought this book for my daughter.She reads out loud and I was listening all the time .I loved the book right away.I started to read the book in bed before I go to sleep.My friends think that I am being silly,but I do not care.I love the book and the fact that you find yourself in the pages,both as parent and as a kid back then.A great book for kids and adults too.Thank you JUDY BLUME.
__label__1 Not very comfortable: I like the fact that the headset eliminates wind noise, but it's not very comfortable to wear. It's either too loose and feels like it's going to fall off or it's too tight and hurts your ear.
__label__2 Punchin' Shrek @ Figure: While not educational exactly, this toy makes up for it by being cute and fun!
__label__1 Want to be depressed? Read this book!: This book would only be 1 star if it weren't so well written. Other than that, it's incredibly depressing. Why can't Wang Lung be a happy farmer? Just when things start to go right in his life, something comes along and destroys it. Read it if you must, but if you have a choice, read About A Boy insted.
__label__1 Not what you would think.: I bought this Pyrex Prepware Measuring Cup thinking that it would be a great way to measure ingredients and pour them into a mixing bowl or to warm up hot water and pour it in a coffee cup filled with hot chocolate. This measuring cup doesn't pour well at all. If you are needing something to warm and pour avoid this and keep your counter tops dry. This is also true of the bigger Pyrex Prepware Measuring Cups as well.
__label__1 Terrible Book: I am a firm Christian, mostly conservative in my beliefs. I am also a good reader. As I skimmed through this book, I was shocked at the number of mistakes the author had made. He was clearly a poor researcher. I have never watched or played Pokemon, so I don't know how many mistakes he made in that part of the book; however, as I read the Harry Potter section, I simply could not believe that this man was making so many claims about the series, using so many big words and sounding so official, when he couldn't even get the author's name right!!! He wrote that "J.K. Rawlings" was the author of a series about people called "Death Enters", and that a "Dark Mask" appeared in the sky. I don't know about you, but I can't take seriously a source that cannot even accurately name the things he calls evil.
__label__2 Cell phone..: I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems. Tracfone has a 'refer a friend' program that will give each of 100 free minutes. All you have to do is send me an email asking for a referral. My email is debsclay@gmail.comthank you.
__label__2 Yet another beautiful collection by Martin Böttcher: Just like "Die Halbstarken/Endstation Liebe" compilation, this CD is put together in a manner that is very difficult to match. The songs are more or less available on other compilation (sometimes the newer compilations offer newer arrangements, not necessarily the originals), but what makes this CD unique is an outstanding packaging with a 100+ pages booklet that includes details from the movie opus Martin Böttcher scored. This music is different because it was written for film, yet the unique musical craftsmanship and superb arrangement by Mr. Böttcher cannot escape your attention. For $11 plus S&H; and little extra wait, this was a steal.In the past, there was a shortage of his music, especially in North America, but now all important titles are available through Amazon.I recommend this CD for every true lover of film music.
__label__2 way way better than nothing: This headphone very much improves my reception outdoors. Without it,the slightest movement of my xm could cause reception to be lost. Now i can move around freely with only rare signal drops. It was somewhat uncomfortable because of how far the earpiece went into the ear. However i now use a piece of 1/4 inch thick foam rubber,cut in a circle with a hole in the middle(looks like a washer). I fit one of these over each earpiece. Works great. Belkin could inexpensivly include somthing like this with the headset. Does Belkin give prizes for ideas like this? Anyway, until the improved model comes out i would recomend this one.
__label__2 Pimpin' By DJ Laz: Yes DJ Laz new cd Pimpin is off the hook and the best song on here is track #6 which is not able to be heard. Trust me if you buy this cd you won't have any doubt in buying it. Tracks 1- 6 is the ones you can ride out to. So go and get this cd and see how Maimi's flavor is.
__label__2 Good, but noisy: I got this because I needed a printer in my dorm room and didn't want to have to keep buying replacement cartridges for an inkjet printer. For its price, this works really well. It is fast and I haven't had any problems with it yet. My only complaint would be that it's kind of noisy.
__label__2 Great book: I had a course in computer programming in C++, but it was pretty hard to understand all the stuff from what the professor said so I purchased this book, and it really helped me a lot in passing the course. It's very well written and it's really a great book and a great start for a beginner in C++.
__label__2 Beware the Wookalar: For anyone else who saw this movie as a youngster and never forgot the pig-snouted wookalar, I recommend this picture without reservation. A movie like they no longer make 'em.
__label__2 A great book on the Mighty Fitz: I ordered this book with the last of a a gift card, and needed something cheap enough that I could buy it and pay for shipping for less than 9 bucks....I am glad I did.I have been interested in shipping and shipwrecks for a while now, and have always been interested in the mystery of the Fitz. I have read a few books about it, but they were written a long time ago. This one was written in 2004 or so, and is a little more modern.Obviously, since no one survived on the ship, there is no way to portray the actual events of the ships sinking. The author does a great job of describing the night and the storm through the memories of the captain and crew of the Arthur Anderson, the ship following and guiding the Fitz.Also, a portion of the end of the book details the investigation of the sinking and the lawsuits and finger-pointing that took place in the years following.A great book for anyone interested in Great Lakes shipping. Very emotional.
__label__2 Pleasantly Surprised: I have never played a game like this before so I'm not sure how it would rate compared to other such games, hence the 4 stars. However, I've really enjoyed playing it and would buy more in this series.
__label__2 Another fun Jenny Cain mystery!: I'm in the process of reading through the entire Jenny Cain series, trying to stick to the order in which Nancy Pickard wrote them. Generous Death was, as the others have been, a quick and very fun read! It's so easy to get caught up in the storyline and develop a true fondness for the characters. I thought I had this one figured out, but was pleased to be surprised in the end!
__label__2 Being the best possible agent for your own idea: The Perfect Pitch: How To Sell Yourself And Your Movie Idea To Hollywood by Ken Rotcop (written with the assistance of James K.

__label__2 Great alternative to expensive lenses: Got this for my SOny HDR CX130, it screwed on right outta the box, and the image quality looks great in HD. The circle is not as wide as the screen when zoomed all the way back (get what you pay for) but you can just zoom in a little bit and get just the blackness in the corners, or zoom a little more and have no blackness at all. There are many better fisheye lenses in the world, but not for $30.
__label__2 14kt Gold Link Bracelet with Agate Cameo Charm: This bracelet looks very beautiful. I really like it. I am a senior, but I bought it for a 15 the birthday present and I think it was a perfect gift.
__label__2 the best marketing book I've read.: If sales people do not believe they are better than an 800 number then they should read this book. Gaining permission from the customer is always the key, and that philosophy is only strengthened in reading this book. The book emphasizes relationships, and leveraging the relationships. The more permission you get the more dollars the client is worth to ones business. I would recommend that all sales people read this book.
__label__2 Great Book!: This book is about a 12 year old girl named Orphelia Bruce. She wants to be a star,but her mother won't let her perform anywhere except for in church.Orphelia's idol is coming to town to do a talent show named Madame Meritta.Orphelia can't perform because she had gotten into trouble earlier that day.So, Orphelia does what she has to do.That includes stowing away in in Madame's storage wagon.Pretty smart,huh? Anyway....oh, yes.She(Orphelia)gets to tag along with the show and even perform.She also unravles a secret to her family's past.LUCKY!!!!!!!
__label__1 Bill Murray Lite: This is a series of sketch comedy. Some work, some don't, but none of them are laugh out loud funny. I bought this for the Bill Murray piece. Unfortunately, I've seen better (and worse) pieces by him on Saturday Night Live. I should have bought that. The Woody Allen take off is okay. To be fair, I made the purchase fully expecting tripe. I was just hoping for a better Bill Murray character. I would have rated it one star, but there is just enough going for it, to keep me from throwing it out after I watched once. This is one you'll have to buy, if you want to see it, because I highly doubt that it's on any rental or library shelves.
__label__1 Buyer Beware!!!!: If you are looking at the CD with the purple/magenta cover w a small photo of the band in the middle, you should quickly realize it's not the REAL deal...the samples on this page are NOT the original 2-CD compilation released in 2005 on EMI Gold...The REAL "The Very Best Of Hermans Hermits" has a vintage photo of the band holding up the back of chair w their names on them.
__label__2 Good price, nice product.: I bought this griddle for pancakes and it works great. Good, even temperature on entire cooking surface. Non stick surface makes for a fast and easy clean up.
__label__2 Shakira es mi cantante favorita: I speak English and I have 5 years of Spanish. I love her music and ever since my friend Tuti told me to buy her cd, I have been hooked. Ciega, Sordomuda is an awesome song. "No Creo" is one of my favorite songs, she can really sing and write. When I looked at the writers of the songs on my Ricky Martin cd, I was laughing because all he is, is an icon. He can sing and dance, Shakira actually has talent.
__label__2 A neccessity for Stratagy RPG players: This is Chapter 6 in the ogre battle series. The game has a well thought out story line that takes you through Magnus Gallant's adventures. The thing is that you are Magnus Gallant and in the game you have many choices to make that deside you ending in small different ways. Also during the game you can get many special characters that will join you if you are good or evil depending on who they are. Also the choices you make effect which characters join you and which don't.I liked this game because it uses a good battle system and has a great story line in fact of the best if seen on a Nintendo 64 game. The game takes quite a while to beat but when you reach the end it is defenatly worth it. Also since thier are 3 different endings you just have to play it again and again to get the other endings.
__label__1 Disappointed, Still have BPA: The shipping box was damaged, 6 of the 12 cans were dented and most diappointing is I received old cans that still have the BPA lining. I read other reviews before ordering and see that other people have received the BPA free cans. I guess my distribution center still has the old stock so be careful!
__label__1 Jury is in; my wife hated it: This was to be one of a few Valentines presents. It's truly a tight choker and I doubt my wife will like it. It also has a smudge on the front observable surface that may come off with a cleaner. I'll wait and see if she likes it. I'll amend this if it works out. It's certainly easy to put on, but it seems too wide and not "long" enough to fit well around high neck sweater. The product description didn't say how long it is, and "choker" more adequately describes this than "necklace" as it is advertised. Roughly measuring it, it is about 15-16" with a 2" gap at the top.UPDATE: returned it b/c it was such an awkward fit and b/c she didn't like it enough to put up with something that fits poorly on her....and she has a thin neck.
__label__2 socialism and spiritualism: strange bedfellows?: At the present day, spiritualists probably feel that they have little in common with socialists and radicals. But Barrow shows that in the early 19th century, there were connections, namely, the conviction that the ordinary man or woman could trust his own common sense, not only in politics, but also in spiritual matters. He did not need to accept the guidance of priests or academic philosophers. Barrow shows, with many revealing quotation from early nineteenth century periodicals, that the rather genteel spiritualism of the 20th century also had other roots. His book is an eye-opener.
__label__2 Great Product for the $: I was not certain this would be the right monopod for my D300 and I was skeptical but I have nothing but a positive review.
__label__2 The book is useful for you.: This book will be useful for you.How?Well,it will teach you basic[see the word]way to play openings.It will teach you how to make plans.You will play base on the pawn structures.There are some errors[notes and positions] in the book but that don't hurt you.I am looking forward if anyone have make a web-page to correct these errors.You could have the book together with 'The art of middle game'.After reading the book,try to learn specific openings.I gave 4 stars because there are some parts of the book that out-dated.And not all the openings are viewed .Buy the book.
__label__2 Funny: This books answers some very funny but important life questions. Answers are great and include a little humor to make the book interesting. Great "emergency" book for bathroom or car.
__label__2 Got us through...: I ordered this product at the recommendation of another nursing mom. At about 8months my milk supply slowed down. I felt sad but was ok with the thought of supplementing with formula. Baby would have NOTHING to do with this idea! I tried nettles tea and fenugreek supplements with little improvement. The more milk plus significantly improved my production and after 48 hours I was able to cut back the dose. Baby THANKS YOU!!
__label__1 Not a success: This movie was crudely done, with only bits and pieces of humor. This was too long, with crude humor and unnessary profanity. If only they cut that unnessary love scene out and made Smith and Kline less competitive and Salma Hayek less of a wimp, this would have been a lot better. Rated PG-13 for profanity, sexuality, and action-related violence.
__label__1 weak: I really don't like watching populist garbage for the sake of one joke an episode (on average), especially when it's done in such an obtusely arrogant way.I highly recommend you do not buy this collection, and I highly recommend you do not ever watch the Simpsons, because it is awful.
__label__1 ozzy speak of the devil dvd poor quality: i have had many bootlegs of this over the past 25 or more years and most of them are better quality than this, i dont know if this is official or not but its not worth your money, i gave it 2 stars for the audio alone video is crap!
__label__2 blessed: it just gets better ever time do you know if there will be a 4th one, i loved the action but come on does it have to be a super model evertime that is the girl?
__label__2 HTC 2000 mobile base: I recently purchased two HTC 2000 mobile bases. One for an older Sears 10 inch Craftsman contractor saw, belt driven. The other base was purchased so I could move a small coal burning stove, around as needed for maintaince etc. The stove is about 350 lbs. Once you put one base together the rest are much simpler. Like anything else once you have done it is a no brainer. Instructions were very good and these units work as advertised. Both the saw and the stove "FLOAT" across the concrete floor! I got them on sale for $49.99 each. I have a welder and have manufactured some of my own mobile bases, but these work much, much easier. When you price out the angle iron and wheels etc. there is not much of a savings anyway. I will be buying more of these when needed.
__label__2 Better appreciated if you have seen the movie: I suspect that people that don't care for this particular album have never seen The Yellow Submarine movie. It isn't one of the best Beatles albums, but it is worth owning, especially if you have seen the movie. If you haven't seen the movie, you should, and you can watch it on Youtube.
__label__1 Disappointed: Bought this product to watch DVD's on my old TV. After following the instructions, the DVD would not play on the TV, and I tried all different combinations for the wires, and it still did not work. My DVD player is brand new, and works fine on my newer TV, so that is not the problem. Would not recommend this product.
__label__2 Cuban fever!: I have just recieved the "Putumayo Presents: Cuba" CD today and have been listening to it at my office constantly. It makes me feel as if I am there in Cuba! The songs and artists each have kept me moving with each different beat and rythym. Inspired by all the music my cuban husband plays, I had to get more music that gives us the feeling of home. I am happy that I have bought this CD! If you love a catchy beat that keeps the latino in you moving, this CD is for you.¡Muchas Gracias!
__label__1 Don't buy this (unless you LOVE condensed matter physics): Ok, ok, my title seems a little aggressive, but trust me, if you are looking for a *computational physics* (C.P.) book, this is not a good choice. I have been lecturing an introductory computational physics course for two years, and, by far, the most adequate books I found (and use) were Giordano & Nakanishi and Landau & Páez ones. Dr. Thijssen's book is highly concentrated on condensed matter physics, and it has *too few* graphics, figures, or illustrations. In my sincere opinion, is by far the worst book on C.P. I have bought, and I do not recommend it, at least for those who want to learn C.P. "from scratch". Ok, ok, it can be considered a "high level" book (maybe adequate for graduate courses), but I think that it lacks the main points on "pure" C.P. The reason for the two stars is because I am a condensed matter physicist, and therefore the book will at least serve as an additional reference on this subject.
__label__2 Very Good!!!: Este CD é muito bom, e , satisfez totalmente o que eu esperava dele! Vale a pena comprar!So many beatiful songs!A great CD!
__label__1 Minutes You Will Never Get Back: This trilogy appears to have been almost randomly created from the Subspecies Bloodstone movies. It makes no sense unless one has seen prior films.Kudos to the editor for the more than a minute long scene in the bedroom with the microphone hanging between the two actors. Even Ed Wood would have caught that one.
__label__1 Good sound... bad stack: I wanted a docking system with speakers that I could take to work. I felt like the cords were all over the place. One to go to each speaker and one for the plug. No battery option either. When stacked the unit was pretty unstable. It fell over and apart (and my ipod feel off the dock) when I barely touched it. Though the sound quality was pretty good it lacks an AM/FM tuner which come on most other dock/speaker combos for around this price. Traded mine in for a more stable and solid system with AM/FM tuner for a few more dollars.
__label__2 great cologne at a great bargain!: one of the best colognes! I recommend it! definitely will draw the ladies attention! and be smelling good all day n night!!
__label__2 Love It!!: This is my first MP3 player~ I am so impressed!Can't beat the price~ 66 bucks and free shipping! The hardestpart was waiting for it to arrive!I read all the reviews here on Amazon and they reallyhelped me out!I intend to use this when I'm working out or mowing the lawn~I really am impressed with this little toy!The only thing I really didn't like was the fact that you have to get the directions for it using the little disk they include with it~ BUT I just printed off the pages I thought I'd need to read and reread and REread (rememember ~ FIRST timer here!) LOLSo far I'm not disapointed with this purchase!My 10 year old daughter is already telling me how cool it is and how much she wants one!
__label__1 Battery failed prematurely: 4 months; less than 10 recharge cycles: Battery failed prematurely.This battery looks very much like the original that came with the camera. However, it had shorter battery life and weighs slightly less than the original.The battery failed to work in the camera after 4 months from date of purchase. It was used very lightly and recharged fewer than 10 times.The camera does not recognize the battery even though the charger indicates full charge. This behavior was reproduced with another camera to confirm the battery failure.
__label__2 Vietnam - the final chapter: I didn't much care about Kerry's War record until I read this book.Every claim Kerry has made since filing for his first "purple owie " to his acceptance at the DNC is scrutinized. Kerry's service related claims are counterclaimed by the authors with Swift boat veterans eye witness accounts ,many foot notes and actual military code citations.Kerry's sworn testimony before the Fullbright Committee as the spokes person for Vietnam Vets Against the War is the most damning evidence against electing this man as president. Kerry asked" How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake". O'Niell and Corsi ask," Who was the last American to die languishing in a North Vietnam prison,forced to listen to the recorded voice of John Kerry disgracing his service by dishonest testimony before the Senate?"The final chapter of the Vietnam War is about to be written.
__label__1 Deceptive and Dumb!: Dre and Ed Lover are all the cover, but they are only in the film for a little bit. The two main characters are not even on the front cover. The scary-looking guy on the cover is a loan shark. That's pretty scary, but it's his cousin who is borrowing funds. Why the family disloyalty here? The film only moves to the Bahamas halfway into things. I really think many of the Island characters are Americans faking West Indian accents. The main characters are a rap duo who say they don't want to be exploited by record execs and then they very willingly get exploited. I love seeing actors of color get opportunities to enhance their resumes, but I have to stop giving PC points there. This is a substandard, dumb, uninteresting, poor-quality flick. It has very few redeeming features. Surely, even the most reclusive, misanthropic film viewer can find something better than this out there. And I was a regular watcher of "Yo! MTV Raps" back in the day, but muh boyz don't save this stinker.
__label__1 Completely Over Rated!: This lady is simply a self absorbed & ungrateful person.Also, this book is not practical at all- for most people can't afford to go to a spiritual journey as hers or spend months on their bathroom floor-things are very different when you have to get up and going in the morning- and an average person who spends a couple of months crying on their bathroom floor till the wee hours will have a lot more to be depressed about then their initial problems- for other things around them will fall apart. I guess this is a good book if you can afford to sc--w everything and disapear. But if you can't afford this- I don't think, as I already mentioned, that ur journey (being the authors journey) is a "practical" one to the point where her journey can help many others. But then again I am just speaking from my perspective as a young, single woman.As for the writing- its beautiful but the message gets lost amongst the authors self centered perspective.
__label__1 Electronics: Topics are not well-put in this textbook. It is not really helpful. There are much better electronics books out there.
__label__2 wow: heres the story, i bought this for my cousin, and he opened it up and we listened to it, we played the prank phone calls in his car, and man, he was driving and almost ran off the road from laughing so hard. its the funniest thing i've ever heard in my life. the songs on disc one are great, all of them. great riffs by deron miller, and co. the x-mas songs are just FUBAR!!! trip through hell...i dont understand them, maybe the guys were drugs...oh well...enjoy, its great.
__label__1 not what was described: I'm really disappointed when the perfume came in. When i smelled it, i was expecting to smell something with mangos in it. Boy was the description wrong, to me the perfume smells like gardenias, which is going to make me sneeze during the allergy season. And what's even more disappointing is the fact that I can't return it. Yeppy, I'm stuck with this damn thing, woopy-do.
__label__2 Everyone should read this awesome book: Atlas Shrugged has been an all time favorite for me and my husband. Still applies to todays world economy. Fantastic.
__label__1 Plus Size Casual Pant: I did not like the pants, they were not at all like I expected, and I would not recommend them to my friends. I wanted a nice pair to wear when I go out, and all I can do is wear them for work.
__label__1 A How To book needs photos!: I was very disappointed in this book. For $16.95, I thought it would be a great resource on making toys for my cockatiel and lovebirds. However, there are no photographs of what the toys and play areas are supposed to look like when you are done. So if the directions aren't totally clear (which I found they are not), you can't even try to figure it out since there is no reference. I'll be selling my copy as this book is useless to me.
__label__1 shut the heck up!!!!!!!!: you bratz fans act like these dolls are the only dolls to buy this is the uglyiest doll on earth!!!!!! why is there a war between dolls you never gave the myscene dolls a chance just because of the way they look!!!!!!!!! i like them both and you should to,well at least you better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 Pretty fun: My one year old loves the phone. It plays music and it has wheels. How perfect! The feature I love most is that the phone actually toggles back and forth when it's pulled/rolled around. Now that's adorable!
__label__1 stuck with it: I received this as a Christmas gift and couldn't take it back. It is the worst. I have to babysit toast to keep it from burning and it takes forever. Both my son and I have been burned trying to get waffles off the back portion of the rack when the wire rack suddenly tilted forward and into our bare wrists. I tried to give it to my daughter for her college apartment but she wouldn't take it (that should tell you something right there!). I miss my old 4 slice toaster and can't wait for this thing to break so I can get something else. This just goes to show that spending more for something doesn't necessarily mean you are getting a better product. Also, looks can be deceiving as it looks very nice sitting on the counter but it isn't worth the space it takes up. Please don't waste you money on this item as you will regret it.
__label__2 Techniques and life teachings of wilderness survival: Great book for children and adults that Love theirkids enough, to give them simple learning skills that could come in handy, when we least expect it.I know of kid's that have already truly been saved by the lessons taught in such a way that, children remember them forever. Everyone should have a copy of this fine work in their home, because we all like the outdoors, but we never know when we might need the guiding know-how in this handbook. As willy says, "make it back safe."
__label__1 poor quality: I bought two and both have come apart. Its a light so it doesn't get rough use. I would not buy again.
__label__1 Bicycle Solitaire: This is nowhere close to the program I had on my old computor. The graphs are bad. It has seperate divisions, in each there are more then one game, but it is the same game over and over just diffent titles
__label__1 Pure Propaganda from a Sad Human: Michael Savage is what is wrong with right wing radio today, he is and "entertainer" not a "news and information source". He claims that liberals hate the church, Isreales, freedom etc... And yet he shuts down and hangs up on anyone that disagrees with his hateful views. He is trying to present himself as the American ideal...where is the democracy in trying to shun other views. He is a psycho.... If you listen to him as a source of reason you are what's wrong with America today. Be objective don't let the right wing dirtbags change your views...they are persuasive "entertainers". I respect all views, but these are coming from an evil troll that crawls out of bed angry because momy didn't love him. His radio show is funny though...if you want to hear a psycho rave from the safety of your radio check it out.
__label__2 A very important Christmas lesson: This story was recommended by Thomas S. Monson, current president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as being a Christmas tradition for him. Its lesson is timeless and valuable.
__label__2 "Old Hollywood" alive and well in the 1980s: The late great William Overgard wrote and drew this strip for two years concurrently with his work on the "Steve Roper & Mike Nomad" strip. There was a bit more whimsy and charm to his work here, in contrast to the urban, street-smart atmosphere in "Roper & Nomad." There is a noticable simplicity to the ink work on "Rudy" compared to "Roper", which works just fine. Overgard shows off his virtuosity at drawing sexy women and classic autos, as well as the streets of LA. As a lifelong fan of the vastly underrated Bill Overgard, I can't convey how much I adore this book. My only regret is that there was never a second volume reprinting the final year of the strip.
__label__1 Awful: I quit reading this book halfway through. Having said that, I'll offer the following observations. First, the research is incredible- he made good use of primary source material, and cited it very thoroughly. That's why I gave him two stars. However, he is terribly tedious, unfocused, and slants leftward at a ninety-degree angle. I would only use this book if I had something that slanted rightward to the same degree to balance it. He is certainly not as objective as a historian should be.
__label__2 Enjoyable and mind-expanding: Enjoyable ride through time from modern ages to the far far future of the universe. The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies.
__label__1 Not a useful guide for a Vegas traveler...: I travel frequently to Las Vegas and was given this book as a gift. Had I perused it in a bookstore, I never would have purchased it for myself. Simply put, the book does not have complete information. The best example is the buffet listing, what one would imagine is a necessity for any Vegas newbie, which omits a number of well-known establishments (like the Aladdin!). When you fly into McCarran or arrive at a casino, pick up any of the free, wekkly published booklets instead of this 'guide', they're far superior!
__label__1 HOW SAD!!: What a total piece of crap. Bought this item for my seven year old and was so disappointed on Christmas morning. I tried the stencils and couldn't even make a decent picture. I even tried replacing the batteries thinking that may be the problem. I can't believe Irwin Associates has the nerve the try and sell this item. What a perfect example of false advertising. For shame Irwin!!!
__label__2 Millionaire Electronic Table Top Game: Lots of fun by yourself or up to 6 people. Good sound and light effects, although these sometimes get annoying and time consuming. Educational for kids of any age, recommended for 8yrs and older. My kids were playing with their cousins' game and asked for one of their own for Christmas.
__label__2 Great: This book has a lot of ideas for lesson planning in the art room. It is divided into sections so that lessons are easy to find and also offers many great children's books to base lessons off of. GREAT!
__label__2 about time gundam on blu-ray 1080p: great. It starts slow but this I think is to introduce the characters and set up the story line. Finally, a gundam story on blu-ray 1080p with 5.1 sound. The dvd is pricey even for a gundam fan.
__label__1 Boring: I had read a good review of this book in the newspaper, and, since I was going to spend a week in Ramona, California, thought I should read it.It is the most boring, dry book I think I ever read. About half the book is references to the writing. I finally gave up on it, and threw it in the trash.
__label__2 Cheers George: As mentioned, this is the second book in a (currently) three book series. Sadly, there won't be a fourth, as George Alec Effinger died last year. It looks like we'll get a taste of it, with "Budayeen Nights" being due in September 2003. From what I've read, this is a collection of short stories and is not the 4th novel we've been waiting for.In this book, Marid works as a policeman in the Budayeen (a walled portion in an anonymous Islamic city, where pretty much anything goes) and making sure that his patron's interests within the police are taken care of. At it's heart, like the first book, it's a mystery...but one with a colorful (to say the least) cast of characters. There is a focus on cybernetics, landing the book squarely in the cyberpunk sci-fi genre, but the electronic gizmos are not the focus of the story. The levels of sex and drug use, and to a slightly lesser extent the violence, in these books is astounding but I don't feel it took anything away from the story.
__label__2 Good but sad.: Sirius was one of my favourite characters. He was funny and really good! Why did he have to die! To make the story more interesting? Although I do like how harry gets the house eve though I hate that house.I love the Magic of Harry Potter. This Book was my favourite though. Anyway I'v always like Magic mixed with adventure. But only if this was real.This book is perfect for people who love to read! I reccomened it to everyone!!!
__label__2 the big band sound: this record exemplifies the best big band music, it is a blend of Stan Kenton and Benny Goodman,GREAT TROMBONE SOUNDheartily recommended
__label__1 Complete shame..: After waiting so long for the next installment it is sad that this is the best we get. I am so disappointed. I kept reading the book waiting for something, anything, to happen. The story never got off the ground, the charactors were flat and at no time inspired my imagination as the previous books had done.
__label__1 Really Hope the Movie is Better: This book was a HARD read. I had to force myself to finish it. I did not find Julie's character to be very interesting and she had few redeeming qualities. She was flat out mean to her brother and to her husband. She was totally self centered, with "The Project" being the center of her world for an entire year, and thinking that she should be treated as the center of the world by everyone in her life.I certainly hope the movie is more entertaining and the characters more engaging.
__label__1 Grills and plates don't last: Have to replace these almost every year. Got to be a better way. They just rust out once the heat gets to it. Wish they make these better.
__label__1 This product is FAKE!: I havent even tried it and I already know its fake since the original is suppose to be white not pink. Very very disapointed
__label__1 Warning: This is the single worst keyboard and mouse I have ever seen. It is literally worthless. The cursor hangs up more often than not and the keystrokes are late in appearing. This despite the fact that the components are within 30 inches of the USB transceiver. I had read several negative reviews but went with MS because I had always had good luck with them. My fault. But, I'm sending it back for a refund which I will use for a Logitech.
__label__2 make sure you have the right battery for your stylus: My husband ordered this battery because it stated it was compatable with the olympus stylus cameras. However, it is not compatable with the new Olympus Stylus 1030SW. For the new 1030SW, you need to buy the LI-50B. Now I'm paying to return the item and get the correct battery for my camera.
__label__1 dont waste your time: i picked this album up the week it was released in 2003 when i was in london and the first two listens are reasonably enjoyable, but the album doesnt age well, the songs arent terribly well written, and it gets grating after a while.do yourself a favor and check out Alice Russell, Nicole Willis and the Soul Investigators, or Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings instead.
__label__1 DON'T: This unit works great for a while then malfunctions or stops working all together. I bought one, and when it leaked into and damaged my cabinet below the sink, I figured I got a bad one and replaced it with a new one. The new one lasted one month longer than the warranty....when the thermostat malfunctioned--the water didn't stop heating at 190 degrees--it boiled inside the unit, its tank ruptured under the sink, and sprayed hot water into the cabinet completely destroying the cabinet this time requiring a major restoration. I, like another reviewer, was told by Insinkerator's own helpline person that this was a "bottom of the line' appliance and not to buy it!Good advice.[My first one cost me $99. The second $116. Now, the price in only three years is up to around $140.]
__label__2 Fits pretty well and well made: I had previously bought a Size 1 in another brand. It was too small. #3 was too big.When I decided on getting the #1 Quick Fit Dog Muzzle, it was because I thought it may fit.It fits pretty well. I had to put it on the tightest setting, but then it works.It took my dog about 10 minutes to stop trying to take it off. Then he was finally good with it on.This is a well-made muzzle and I would recommend it. But know your dog's size so you won't end up with 3 muzzles.
__label__1 Software: I purchased a GPS V with the hopes of being able to use my laptop to route my planned summer trips. To my great disappointment the software does not allow you to display a turn by turn result on the PC. It only displays a bearing and a line of site mileage. This is worthless. You can't see before you load it into the GPSv how it is routing the trip. Shortest, fastest, no U-turns etc. Nor the over all mileage or places to stop for gas or a hotel. This is not what I want and I will go look for another unit or buy a routing software. The unit might be OK but the software is terrible.
__label__1 Worse Than I Remembered - Which Is Not Much: I grew up when the 'Dukes were around. I always loved 'Journey' but I never bought any of the Duke album - yes they were actually albums in those days. Now I know why. Ouch! Ted could smoke on the guitar but the group as a whole pretty much comprehensively [stunk]. Compares to Hendrix? Hey give me some of that stuff. Anyway this CD is an interesting historical document in that it shows that my musical tastes were not as warped as the rest of my mind back in those days. Now that I've ripped 'Journey' who wants a great deal on a very slightly used CD?Now how many of you - please raise your hands - really believe that Ted did not know that 'Journey' was a drug song? Sure Ted - here really is an Easter bunny, at least if you haven't blown off its head yet.
__label__2 Definitely worth purchasing: Very well put together instructional DVD. Good chapter set-up. We can't all remember everything our in-person kite boarding instructors yell to us over the wind while running our equipment upwind over wet sand. This an awesome DVD that you can leisurely watch for specific areas/techniques (chapters) to find out or reinforce what your instructor actual said. Next time out, you're sure to show progress. Background music a little grating after awhile. Please don't use this DVD as a substitute for professional kiteboarding instruction, yes ,its expensive but cheaper than ER visits and broken equipment!
__label__2 Lighthearted Entertainment: This film for me has always been a guaranteed laugh. The southern accents and snooty New York attitude superbly played are hilarious! Bette Midler and Lilly Tomlin now how can you come up with a better duo other than double it.
__label__1 My First "McCartney" Disappointment. . .: Like the gal wrote in an earlier review. . ."I'm surprised at all the good reviews!".Like most all of Paul's CD's. . .I've either preordered, or purchased without any sampling. When this came in the mail, both my wife and I were severely disappointed. Paul's voice was sounding whiney and strained. . .and. . . with exception of a couple of tunes, the writing wasn't all that good. We feel that Paul's talent has finally succumbed to his ego. His work smacks of a man who feels that everything he does is genius. If all this wasn't bad enough. . .I find that the two entire CD's can be loaded on one standard CD-R. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Paul believes that his fans want to hear 20 minutes while he dribbles on about how he came to write the songs. . .Great marketing ploy here. . .little else. Sorry Paul.
__label__1 Not very impressed: I saw no results or changes from using this product, it doesn't work as advertised. My dog didn't mind it too much although he didn't seem to love it either.
__label__1 I want the name of his agent!: This was the first book I've read by David Friedman and I'm sorry to say it will also be the last. He created a wonderful world full of promise and what appeared to be interesting characters, but it fell far short of its initial promise. Other reviewers have commented on the faults in this book (choppy writing, no depth to characters, difficult to follow dialog, etc) and I agree with those comments. I can only imagine that he must be a wonderful success in the other areas he writes about so that his publisher agreed to produce this less than stellar work of fiction. If not, I'd really like the name of his agent because I have this idea for a story...
__label__1 Just awful!: The author depicts the beautiful Rainbow Fish as constantly and impolitely snubbing the other fish until they no longer want to play with him. Thus, he shares his scales with all the other fish so that he's no longer special and they all look alike. What?! This is not good.The message should have been that however you look, you should be humble and kind to others, not that you should rid yourself of (or share) all that makes you special and unique. Rainbow Fish should have kept his gorgeous scales and learned some manners. This is a bizarre and disturbing book whose popularity baffles me.
__label__1 Oh my goodness----just... No: I personally hated this book. I found it thouroughly boring it's tone was intolerqbly bleak and epressing--and poor Boxer! This book was such a bummer. I highly suggest AGAINST reading this book. I'm sure some people enjoyed, but most of my English class and I disliked it. I'm sure the author was a wonderful person, but this was just not a good book. Read something happier like, oh I don't know, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It's amd excellent read, and with the Holidays coming up, everyone wants to feel happy.
__label__1 So she wants to be President. ??: I haven't read the book. I'm pretty confident that it's dedicated mostly to making a mountain out of several alleged mole-hills. So I'm a communist monster, dupe, etc. Read this anyway. You'll find it amusing.I'm just writing to mention to all you zealots out there that wanting to be President is a legitimate, common tendency among government officials of every stripe.I dare say your diety Mr. Bush at one point wanted to become president. His will-to-power however is the most common of human traits. This isn't one of his flaws. Don't pretend it's one for Hillary.Her largest flaw is that she disagrees with you. It makes your skin crawl. Even if she's misguided and wrong, is this so evil?I have to ask - is she really important enough to obsess over after three years out-of-office?Perhaps you should find some other, new people to focus your carefully cultivated loathing and anger upon - and maybe get real lives?
__label__1 Bird-X worthless: Wasted good money on this device. Woodpeckers drilling holes 5 feet fromit as it blasts away. Bothers nothing except my neighbors.
__label__1 Load SUX big time!!!!: Well, what can i say. I only gave Load one star, because i was unable to give it 0. And 0 it deserves. After the great thrash music they wrote in the 80's they write this great steaming turd. I was bitterly dissappointed with this album. Even though black was softer than justice and puppets, it still had some great riffs. Load has none. Songs like mama said and hero of the day are just not what metallica are good at. Absolute no song on here is good. They are so bad they cant even be put into the pathetic category. Stay away from this unless you are a die hard metallica and simply have to have just for the sake of having it. Dont buy it for the music!!! And to all those who think Load is good, I say: You arent a real Metallica fan, if u were u would say Load sux and listen to puppets instead.
__label__2 Great purchase, price, printer!: This printer was not only a great price, but it does a fantastic printing job. Very easy to set up and prints photos with ease and excellent quality. Don't miss your chance to pick this up at the very reasonable price.
__label__1 Unique, but bad style: I could not get into this book because of the very unique style. This book is not written in a typical biography style. You'd rather like this book because of the writing syle, or you'd hate it. I am the latter. Very disappointed.
__label__2 200+ Pages of Personal Mentoring: This is a must read. I have read five other books on VO and this one is my favorite. It is highly readable with real insight into the biz and hardcore guidance. If you haven't read Harlan's book, I have an edge on you.
__label__1 Wrong AGAIN!: This review is for the quality control alone. The actual part is just fine.For the 2nd time in a row, I ordered 6 Ten Packs and received 6 individual caps instead of the 60 that I requested. I figured the first time was a fluke, but twice in a row? And on top of the wrong items being sent, the receipt in the box was for a "Hamusuta the Happy Hamster In Ball" (no kidding). Sounds fun, but it won't fill my need for vacuum port caps.
__label__1 Definitely NOT that great!: This book professes to cover everything, and thatis hardly the case. If you want a book that truly covers everything, try Web Publishing UnleashedProfessional Reference. I love THAT book. This book, however, just didn't cut it. How can you cover a topic in a few paragraphs or a few pages and claim comprehensive coverage?
__label__2 krs is it!: as one of the innovators of real hip-hop KRS has never let up on his lyrics, style or performance, he's at 100% all the time, on this album he's at 110%! his firt solo effort away from BDP is incredible. don't try to compare this album with the efforts that followed, as good as they are, this his best so effort to date
__label__2 NCIS first season: What can I say, it is fantastic to go over the beginning of the series. The disc quality is great, the disc extras are not much, but who really needs much with this series? Some of the episodes are rarely shown on TV in rerun, I don't know why, but they are some of the better epis.
__label__1 Bad Plastic: Cards arrived and 3 out of 54 arrived with a piece of the corner missing. This means that I cannot use these for poker as I intended. The plastic used in these is cheap and most likely acquiring a complete undamaged set is hard. Have used them sparingly due to the the fact that it is almost like playing with marked cards and no other cards have yet been broken or gotten damaged apart from the 3 that came chipped.

__label__2 A Journey Worth Taking: I really enjoyed this book. It uses poetry to express the emotional ride that we all take as we travel through our lives. The poetry definitely touches on feelings and times that everyone goes through. There's something in here for everyone. I highly recommend it!
__label__1 Ummmm, no.: What the hell was going on when you people did this!?!?! The only bit of help I got was in those few sections, where it's not exactly clear where you need to go next (i.e. City of the Ancients, Disc 2), and to help beginers with materia junctioning. And I am missing 2 and only 2 of the Enemy Skills, no thanks to the guide, which only gives you about 10. If you want secrets, hop online kiddiesm cuz this was just no good at all. I'm not even sure if it listed anything about thar damned, locked treasure in the man house in Kalm. Also, no 1/35 soldiers...I have 3! Where are the others? Save your money for something good.
__label__2 A good parody of a survival book. It feels real.: This book is really good. It almost makes you want to drop whatever you're doing and beging preparing yourself for when the zombies come.But it also feels so serious. In some parts it gets kind of boring. Not enough for me to drop it, but still. It takes itself seriously enough to give detailed information about nearly anything related on zombie anatomy an behavior. Also every option you may have to survive a zombie outbreak is also thoroughly explained, with many possible outcomes.The description of recorded zombie outbreaks through history is very, very cool.But from a literary point of view, this is a really outstanding book. It doesn't matter how big of a parody this is, it never drops the straight face. It will always tell you the zombies are coming and what your best chances of surviving are. It will never crack a joke nor break the fourth wall. Not even in the acknowledgements.For Mr. Brooks, as this books is concerned, the zombies ARE COMING.
__label__2 another succesful amazon order: another succesful amazon book order for me...seems to be the sure way to go when looking for hard to find books at great prices
__label__2 I relly enjoyed it.: This anime was worth the money. It is a nice anime to watch if you like the pervert humor side of things. the quality is very good nicely colored and the audio is great too , it sorta has its points where it's not as up beat like the First season but this second season makes up for it in depth of some characters which i loved the fact it recaps in to the romance area. It reminds me of Heavens Lost Property in some parts but like i said the pervert humor side of things makes it a blast. Very glad I got it and can not wait for the next one.
__label__1 Waste of Money: Used to think highly of HP as a company; this Laserjet has changed my previously high regard. Doesn't work on office network; had to pay extra money to IT to make the printer work on the network. Waste of money; machine constantly is "initializing...", interrupting available print time, which takes too long once it starts. Color cartridges are outrageously expensive. Wish I'd sent this thing back the first day. Will buy Brother next time.HP Color LaserJet 2840 All-in-One Printer/Copier/Scanner/Fax (Q3950A#ABA)
__label__1 KIndle Book Cover: There are better options than this book cover. If you do not "hook" the Kindle into the cover its going to slip out. When you do get it "hooked" in, trying to reach the on/off switch will unhook it. When you do want to take it out when its "hooked" in the back cover comes off also. Its better than nothing, but if your buying it, go for the more expensive types with the 4 corner tabs to hold the Kindle in place.
__label__2 This film is great!: This film is excellent! I've seen it several times now and it just keeps getting better! Even if you're not a fan of the Real World, you will love this film! It's smart and super funny! Heather B does rock!:)
__label__1 best of sucks: What ever happened to releasing full seasons on dvd. you release season one and thats it ? Until you start releasins full seasons I wont be buying this mish mash.
__label__1 Poor Quality, High Price: Actually miserable quality. These U.S. made side-cutter pliers take two hands to open and the cutting edges do not mate. I wrote a courteous letter to Channelock and received no reply. That being the case, I would stay away from the brand completely, as there is no customer support.
__label__2 My Number One of 2004: From the rollicking opener, "Laura," to the coming-out-to-mom-at-a-gay-bar anthem "Take Your Mama Out," to the cover of Pink Floyd's "Comfortably Numb," the album kicks off with three solid radio singles and never lets go. There was no timelier song in the year of Janet than "T*ts on the Radio," no funnier song than "Music is the Victim," no more danceable ode to a tryst mate who will never be anything more than "Better Luck," no more glam-tastic paean to casualties of too many crystal hits at gay clubs than "Return to Oz." I could go on rattling off superlatives about this album, but take my word: this is the wildest ride of the year.
__label__2 A Trip Through Dickens in a beautiful way..: I researched the websites to order this flick again, because our old copy fizzled out. Its an incredible story and scary at the same time in its own way. Finney is remarkable, and Guinness as well. The old Victorian settings breathe a kind of life in to the film well worth remembering. Tiny Tim is heartwrenching and the sadness along with joy is one worth rewatching each Christmas. I give Finney a true five star rating performance for his authentic performance as Scrooge. If you dont own this, get it...Merry Christmas 2002!!
__label__2 Caveat Emptor: Buyer Beware. If you have the right system and connection, this game rocks.DO NOT buy this game unless you have at least a GeForce 3 64mb graphics card and 768 mb RAM. If you don't know for sure that your system meets those specs, then it probably doesn't.Also: this game is a multiplayer internet action game. DO NOT play it without DSL or a Cable Modem. You will not enjoy it.There are some other technical problems but they are not major.
__label__1 Unremittingly boring: This award-winning "novel" by William Gaddis is unremittingly boring and I recommend it only to your worst enemies. The writing is so bad that I could not understand what was going on. And, after a couple of pages, I didn't care. This so-called "novel" is nearly all dialogue which is not necessarily a criticism, but the characters in JR are so pretentious and boring that having to put up with their blather is like being trapped at the bottom of the ocean in that jumbo jet from AIRPORT '77 with a cabin full of literary critics. If you absolutely must torture yourself with a chatty novel full of bad dialogue, I recommend Thomas Pynchon's MASON & DIXON. At least that bloated masterpiece features talking clocks and giant vegetables
__label__1 It was Alright...: I first tried the silver crackle polish and fell in love with it, so I had to try the white! I chose a hot pink color for the base and waited for it to dry completely, I then applied the white crackle and waited for it to dry. It completely picked up on the pink and turned itself into a light pink color of its own. My finger nails looked like Valentine's Day colors! Needless to say, it wasn't what I was expecting. I will keep trying it to see if I can find a good color combo, but so far, nothing looks that great with it.
__label__2 Sony earbuds: Great product, bought them for use while overseas, good sound/noise cancellation, great for loud airplane rides, getting sleep in crowded or noisy environments. Decent sound, good bass, well worth it.
__label__2 This is the "holy grail" of all puzzle games!: This is truly an awesome game. I love how the pictures, music and storyline all blend together while at the same time you are cultured and gain a sense of accomplishment. The best games are those where you learn without realizing it. Bravo, Alexey Pajitnov! (If there was any concern, this game is compatible with Windows XP)
__label__2 Great way to review dish color: I bought this dish to see what the set pattern and color would look like. I ended up loving it and purchased two sets of dishes (8 settings in all).
__label__1 Me and My Brother: These guys are a dirty south crunk trio and this is there third album some of the stuff I heard was wack and some was good.I have heard about 5 songs off this album but there probally the Top 5 Songs well any way here it goes.Lyrics 4/10 Production 3/10 X Factor 7/10 Classic 3/10 Me 6/10Overall-23/50 wich is good for 2 Mics try again please
__label__1 This golf game never scores a hole in one.: I wasted my money when I bought this game, from the reviews I had seen, I thought that this was a game that you built and played your own golf course. You never play the course and the graphics are terrible. Simgolf is far better than this one (and I have that too). I would not recommend purchasing this game.
__label__1 the first but not the last time I got "Lynched": saw this dog in Harvard Square, at which time Dave was being lauded as a new cinematic genius too deep for ordinary fools to appreciate (classical Harvard dogma). The "Disaster That Was Dune" sums him up well enough; it was visually sharp, but utterly dead on the screen, as he seems to have an extremely tenuous grasp of what a human personality is. Having been thus mugged twice, I gave his television series a pass, which apparently was a surreal (what else?) soap opera that Was embraced by the aforementioned fools. Oh, yes, He did manage to sustain contact with earth long enough to direct Blue Velvet, which Was well done.
__label__2 WONDERFUL!: EXTREME ART! ANDY GARCIA RENDERS AN EPOCH IN CUBAN HISTORY WITH CONSUMMATE ARTISTRY AND GREAT TASTE.
__label__2 Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values: I ordered this for my husband and it was just what he wanted. Could have used a more up-to-date printbut don't think it's available yet.Thanks.
__label__2 Cliplight success story: Used this product on a 1957 Continental Mark II with factory air conditioning. The air conditioner had a moderate leak that would leak the freon down to significant bubbles in a week. I installed the Cliplight leak sealer according to instructions. The system leaked initially so that some slight bubbles were visible in the sight glass but after driving the car with the air on for a reasonable period of time the leaking either stopped or was significantly slowed, it has been five weeks since the product was installed and the air conditioner is still making cold air and the visible bubbles have not noticeably increased. I was skeptical but the product seems to actually work at least considering the costs of professional air conditioner repair it's worth a try.
__label__1 INTERMITTENT CONNECTIVITY: This may be a great card, but I have had to reinstall the drivers twice because it would not connect to the web via the Netgear Router.Now I am receiving a message that this is not a digitally registered copy of the drivers, whatever that means.We have two other cards on older Macs from the old "Airport" system which are trouble-free compared to this card.Maybe its my computer, but this has not been a favorable experience for me!
__label__1 Give it a BIG MISS!: I was EXTREMELY dissapointed when this book arrived in the mail. my first impression?? what a waste!. Im a gehry fan through n' through dont get me wrong, i rate gehry in the top 5 architects of all time. however it would be wiser to spend your money on "The complete works: Frank O.Gehry" (now thats a fab book!!) or "Gehry talks" etc, etc. This book is TINY, a little bigger than your hand. it does have o.k pictures but its certainly not worth the US$15 i paid for it......what did i do with it? lets just say it was great for compost!.
__label__1 Offensive customer service!: Great product, but Cook's has major customer service issues. Was decieved, lied to, and treated very poorly by their staff after ordering a book for the holiday's (it arrived a week late!) I'd avoid any company that treats itsPAYING customers this poorly.
__label__1 This book stank.: This book succeeded in being weird while at the same time remaining completely pointless throughout. To make matters worse, it had pretensions of contributing to the serious and well established genre of the ghost story. Of course, how good could any novel be in which the main character is a part time Hollywood producer part-time adventurer named "Richard Storm"? Or sentences such as: "He clasped Sophia against him, felt the warmth of her body there, drank the warmth of her body in with his." This book has "pulp" written all over it. None of this would be so bad if this book were more fun and not so gross and violent.
__label__2 A worthy addition to my bookcase.: To be honest, I only picked this book up because I like having lots of computer books in my bookcase, and I like having as many references on hand as possible. I really didn't expect anyone to know more on the subject than I did.While I was mostly right, the book did manage to discuss the topic with surprising lucidity without losing a bit of detail. Not a small feat considering the subject matter. It also manages to be very lean, not wasting any time on theory or conceited tangents that just tend to waste the readers valuable time.The only problem I had with the book is the cover. While programming books are not known for their stylish leather binding or gilded pages, I'd prefer to have a book that didn't look so much like "chicken soup for the GUI" on my shelf.I recommend the book for anyone interested in working with SWT/JFace.
__label__1 It's wasn't as bad as people say!: Paris Hilton IS NOT on my current summer Hot List, but it's not like she totally sucks!Sure, her voice is a little...Fran Drescher on acid, but it's not totally unbearable. I think some of the people that are reviewing this aren't really sugar-pop kinda people, either.Paris Hilton, yes, is a megarich, megasnobby, conniving little fashionista, but you guys are making it sound like she's Jeffrey Dahmer or Willian Hung! Paris' voice does NOT suck, and she did NOT eat people, so cut the heiress a little slack and listen to the lyrics, and not her provacative outfits.Plus, we can't exactly bag on her-she can go a million dollar shopping spree and not be broke.Her voice is okay, but I suggest just burning a couple of her songs onto a CD, and not spending 17.95.
__label__1 No Johnny and Roy: Johnny and Roy do not appear in this DVD much. Big disappointment. But the rest of the DVD's are great.
__label__1 Didn't Work: I gave this product 2 stars because, according to other reviews, it works for most people. But mine was missing the necessary switch and extra bulb (not that it was needed without the switch). Luckily I bought it from Amazon so the return process was simple. Also, I read the directions and apparently the light will only work to its full potential for 1 hour, after that the lighting power will diminish and those batteries are not cheap. I was not able to witness this first hand but it's right there in writing from Streamlight.
__label__1 Despite all the right ingredients...tastes terrible!: Quite simply one of the least funny comedies I have seen. The cast alone should ensure that it at least raises a giggle if not a belly laugh, however it just isn't there.The only movie I have ever turned off three quarters of the way through. I think that pretty much sums it up.
__label__2 Slingbox Pro Works as Advertised: Excellent out of box experience. Follow the connection guide and load the software and it works. I have the entire spectrum of connections, PC, MAC, Wireless Notebook and Handheld. All work great. If you have an HD signal you will need to purchase their connection cable and if you have a hand held you also have to buy their software - only criticism. It is just cool to play HD wide screen on a hand held! If you are on the fence, jump over, this is a great product.
__label__1 Great concept, but waste of money: When I purchased this item I thought, "what a brilliant idea!". But while it's great to have a water bottle and bowl all in one, this thing is cheaply made and a waste of money. The bowl attachment broke off on the first use. And you really won't want to pour your dog's slobbery, dirty water back into the canteen for a 2nd use. I'm still using this, as it's convenient, but wouldn't recommend to others.
__label__2 Great Overview on the History of Oil: This is an excellent book for anyone wanting to learn about the history of the oil industry and its effect on World history. Not only is it informative, but it is also well written and interesting to read.Although it is almost 1000 pages long, it kept my interest throughout. Much of the book is focused on the impact oil, or lack of it, has had on governments and wars. Although the book discusses many major oil field discoveries with some detail. I would have preferred the author to go into more detail with regard to the discovery of Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea. Nonetheless, this is a book that I would strongly recommend to any history fan or anyone interested in oil.
__label__2 MUST Read: This book is a must read for any dog lover. The stories are heartfelt and tug at the emotions. This is a well written book, with short stories that are easy to read and enjoy.
__label__2 Pretty Nice just one downside: this is a very nice ring, after i misplaced my other purity ring iam currently using this one. the only downside is it only comes with 4 prongs not 6 like viewed in the picture
__label__2 Excellent Quality: This poster is very, very beautiful, and the printing is excellent quality; very glad I purchased it.Dan is a great artist!
__label__1 Not green, not good: This decaf really disappointed me, esp. given the other glowing reviews. It does not appear green, nor does it taste "green" (ie: doesn't have that fresh "grassy" flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea). Actually, this could be a good paring with seafood, because I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste. Yuk. Stash Decaf Green, the non-organic, non-premium tea, is actually a little better than this one. What people like is a matter of personal taste, but I won't ever buy this tea again.
__label__1 " Includes Everything You Need" - what a crock!!: It clearly says right on the box "Includes Everything You Need". That would indicate to me (and most people) that besides the cake and possibly icing - everything you need is included in the box. This is incorrect. You are expected to purchase dowels and do drilling! in order for this cake to stand up. Very disapppointing! Wilton should be ashamed of itself. Maybe this is good for a professional cake decorator who already has these types of materials and has possibly done something like this, but for the rest of us - not good. The only thing this box includes are a bunch of crappy plastic castle pieces and some TERRIBLE instructions. Save your money and sanity and shell out the money and buy one at the food store.
__label__2 This is a great book: A lot of instructors use this book for reference. It is one of the best books in this subject that I have seen. however the material isn't easy and for beginner students this book will be chalenging.
__label__1 Entity Relationship Modelling considered Harmful: Prospective buyers should be aware ERM is a mistake. It is a vastly oversimplification of actually modelling, being incapable of representing many fundamental features of any relational model and even being misleading.ER diagrams OTOH are nice for drafting and presentation purposes. Just don't confuse them with a real model.
__label__2 redefining what metal should sound like.: this will be short, i just bought this and Colony the same day, i heard how colony and clayman are regarded as in flames pinnacle, not to speak down about colony it's good in it's own right but clayman was on a completly nother level of melody, musicianship, lyrics, i've owned whoracle forever and love everytrack on that i put colonly up there with whoracle for the longest time whorcacle was my favorite in flames cd but that might be changing here not sure yet have to listen to them some more. if u listen to in flames new or old listener, u owe it to yourself to pick up any 3 that i just mentioned. enjoy.
__label__1 Total junk: Unlike other unsatisfied owners, the battery in my unit lasted quite a while per use. However, the entire unit completely died after about 12 uses. It's completely charged (light on the charger is green), but it won't turn on. There's sort of a warranty on the unit. The local Toro dealer said they might be able to do something for me, but the wait for a replacement is three weeks. Why would I bother waiting three weeks for another piece of junk?Getting something else...and NOT a Toro.
__label__2 Bronson's best: Although one would have to have totally invulnerable knuckles and hand bones to do these fights in real life (as a doorman in the 70s I broke them three times hitting skullbone), this is Bronsons best, lean dialogue, "just the money".
__label__2 Great game: I dont know what all you people are talking about as to why this game is hard to install. I had no probs installing it. And i dont have a Great comptuer, but i had no probs with it. It took me like 5 min to install and 1 more min to start playing. But I can say that The game and the multiplayer part are great.
__label__2 Found the bad reviews to be wrong: I am currently pregnant with our 2 child. I have less then a month to go until my due date and I found this to be easy to put together by myself with only a toddler to help me. I can not comment on how the baby sleeps in it yet but I found it to be built more stable then some reviews made it seem. So far I'm happy with the product. I don't think we will be able to use it long but we only want it until the baby is on a schedule. Shipping was very fast.
__label__1 arrived with whistling cap broken!: Very poor quality. Brand new out of the box, the handle is loose on the end that joins by the spout. When I push the red button down, the whistling cap jiggles and may or may not actually open. If it opens, it does not close again properly.
__label__1 Read all the info: I didn't realize that I was purchasing a miniature book. Good content, but not really what I was expecting. I have enjoyed other books by this author.
__label__1 Why EA? Do you really think you can take advantage of me?: This is pathetic. I am not going to spend $50 on any game that limits MY usage of it. I wont even buy the game if it was selling for 10 dollars on discount. Why? Because you SUCK Electronic Arts.You know what? Even IF you fix the problem, I am still never going to buy ANY of your games again, including those for the ps3, 360, and Wii.
__label__2 Homeopathy made easy: This book is well-written, easy to read, and contains a lot of valuable information for the person who would like to use homeopathic medicines at home. This is definitely one of the books that I would keep for future reference.
__label__2 Just What it Promises: Design IDEAS: No, it's not a woodworking book with instructions for how to build the pieces pictured. It's a book of executed ideas that one may use for your own designs. I have the soft cover, which is better than the hardcover, if judged by the reviews. I love the history of built-ins and the great pictures. The text is wrapped around the pictures and great pleasure reading. He does show some things, such as: how to create a pattern to ensure the piece fits, how to scribe a foundation so the piece rests levelly on an imperfect floor, how to use trim to hide gaps of varying width, or make a strong joint. This book will help you come up with your own pieces or adapt the designs in the book to your space but you will need another book, or a woodworker, to build them.
__label__2 Gotta love Calphalon: I love Calphalon but can rarely afford it, so when I see it on sale, I buy it. This pot is wide enough to hold several full ears of corn but not so tall that you waste lots of water cooking it. It will be perfect for soups and chili, and for cooking for a group.
__label__2 More bang for the buck: While you can get a slight improvement by buying a ti 4600, This has a much greater price to effectivity ratio. This product is perfect for 3d gaming. I can play any of the latest games on the highest settings, and the 64Mb's RAM is actually faster than the 128Mb version because the RAM is a faster kind.
__label__1 A stretch. . . (pardon the pun): I've enjoyed all of Gail Sher's books on writing for their clarity and truth, but her lastest is just a bit too much. It almost seems as though she has said all that she can possibly say about the way to approach writing so now she writes a book about Yoga and writing. Ugh. Just seems so gimmicky, not real, a bit "out there" for the sake of sounding like a wise guru and possibly just an excuse to write another book. There are so many other books an aspiring writer can read in order to enlighten themselves on how to make words "come alive." This , definitely isn't one of them.
__label__1 Wait for the paperback: or better yet, get it from the library, so you don't spend money on it. I had to force myself to finish it. I like his other books, but this one let me down.
__label__1 I hated the author's sense of humor: I was really looking forward to reading this book. However, the author's attempts at making witty jokes throughout the novel really grow old. There's a couple on every page, and they're not good. Even the stories he had to write weren't exactly gripping.I much prefer the dated "Ken Uston on Blackjack" if you want to read about high-stakes, professional Blackjack play.
__label__1 Dead at 7 Weeks: Do I like the product? Yes...if it would work. After seven weeks, the entire thing came to a grinding halt...poof! This would be only somewhat more amusing if the last Ipaq I owned, a 3630, had not had the screen go out when it was less than a month old. Compaq was nice enough not only to charge me $125.00 to repair it, but to erase the memory(not sure what that had to do with repairing the screen) and take nearly a month to return it to me. It took almost twenty phone calls and letter to the CEO of Compaq to get it returned. One other note. It does not come with a protective case which you MUST have. Add $25.00-$40.00 to the cost for this. It also does not come with a cradle. Add more for that. As a would-be purchaser, I would be leery of cheap manufacturing and terrible customer service.
__label__1 Just like Mini Robosapien.: It walks. No, it does the moon walk. And its spins. And spins. And spins.
__label__1 Don't waste your time: This headset is VERY Cheaply made and will not stay in your ears. If you move AT ALL they will fall out. I had to buy another set so I chose the Nokia headset. They work very well.
__label__1 I don't think anybody needs this book: hockeydb.com is a much better source for hockey stats info and that is free yes the stats are good and it is nice to have them on hand without a computure but really why would you need them if your at a game you'd have to search through the book to get what you want
__label__2 Dumbful but Playful Comedy.: A group of Amateur Heavy Metal Band named The Long Rangers (Brendan Fraser, Steve Buscemi, Adam Sandler), they try to give thier music cassette to a Radio Host (Joe Mantegna). But everything falls apart, when the Amateur Band take over The Radio Station and Taken people Hostage from inside the Radio Station.This film has some moment of laugh out situation comedy here. Fraser, Buscemi and Sandler are fun in this film. Great Rock & Roll music, Directed by Micheal Lehmann (Hudson Hawk, The Truth about Cats & Dogs, My Giant), Dumb fun. Grade:B+.
__label__2 AWESOME! A MUST for ANY music collection!: If you have an ear at all for a great pianist, you'll love this album! If you like New Age, you'll love this!One of the best and most innovative artist to come along in a VERY long time!Rated one of the top 100 new age albums of all time!Incredible - a MUST HAVE!
__label__2 A seminal reference for architects, designers, builders and home remodelers: Saburo Yamagata (1911-1986) was a graduate of Kobe University, Japan, and a practicing architect. He drew from more than 1,800 designed from traditional Japanese homes to create The Japanese Home Style Book, a seminal reference for architects, designers, builders and home remodelers. Covering every element of traditional Japanese architectural design, the entries are systematically arranged for quick reference and easy of use. Included are paper-and-wood shoji screens; fusma sliding panels; door and window designs; tatami mat arrangements; decorated ceilings; latticed and carved transoms; tokonoma scroll alcoves; "staggered shelf" layouts; outdoor verandas and railings; garden fences and screens; as well as stepping-stone paths; decorative patterns and motifs for every purpose. The Japanese Home Style Book is a seminal contribution to professional and academic Architectural Studies and reference resource collections.
__label__2 Wow!: What a difference this made to our lives! My wife picked it up, and didn't tell me. A couple of weeks (and some great sex later) I started asking what was going on. She then told me that she had read this book, I must say that having been on the receiving end it is HIGHLY recommended! Wish I could give it more stars!
__label__2 Excellent, versatile mounting device for your Garmin: It is great to be able to move your Garmin from one car to another quickly or move it from the dash to the floor of the car when parked to keep it out of plain view..
__label__1 Got the tape instead??????????: They sent me the tape instead - very poor service and i am really mad that they had the nerve to charge me anyway...what do i do????
__label__1 Technical Support Stinks!: I just bought this product. I could NOT get it to install on my computer...I finally broke down and called customer support. Ugh.I had a very hard time understanding the person on the other end of the phone. The accent is very thick. It was a test of my patience! The call took longer than it should have because of me constantly having to ask, "pardon me? Excuse me? Could you repeat that?"The product itself? Not sure yet. I finally (!!) got it installed.
__label__1 Deserves 0 Stars!: This program is useless! Don't waste your hard-earned money on this junk. The interface is horrible, the overall design absolutely makes no sense, and the so-called components won't work.Bottom line is... unless you want to flush your money down the tubes, don't bother buying this.Instead, may I suggest Dreamweaver, or NetObjects Fusion; two very high quality programs.
__label__2 One of the best Movies i've seen in my life.: Simply Amazing movie! this is one of my top 20 films of all time and it remaines in my mind forever. it's about a Man who gets his memory erased and goes to Mars to get it back, before he is dead. Unforgetabble, outstanding, entertaining, never-dull, Gore-infested, action packed thrill ride that will take you on a memoriable journey to the edge. i will never forget the first day i saw this movie in 1990 at the theater when i was 8, i seemed too young to see it but i loved it and i will love it forever. Truely a must see or must own!Recommendations: Robocop, Commando, Starship Troopers, The Fifth Element, Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, Heavy Metal, Scanners, Independence Day, Blade Runner, Spaceballs, The Dark Crystal, Star Wars with Episode I, The Matrix, and Con Air.
__label__2 Kindle 6": I wasn't sure I would be able to adjust to an e book as I am a library goer. I love the feel of a book. I carry one with me all the time. But, except for initially having a little bit of trouble shutting it down, I've adjusted very quickly. I LOVE my Kindle. It slips easily in my purse. No more losing my place or toting a heavy book. I LOVE my Kindle.
__label__2 How to be Worthy of One's Suffering: Frankl, who survived the concentration camps, writes that suffering is inevitable and that avoiding suffering is futile. Rather, one should be worthy of one's suffering and make meaning of it instead of surrendering to nihilism, bitterness and despair. He uses poetic, moving anecdotes from the concentration camps to illustrate those souls who find a deeper humanity from their suffering or who become animals relegated to nothing more than teeth-clenched self-preservation. Though not specifically religious, this masterpiece has a religious purpose--to help us find meaning. This book succeeds immeasurably.
__label__2 Still the greatest: Brian does it again. He is such a versatile artist. I just love him. After seeing him perform live you just fall in love with him or somebody. His music just brings all the emotion out of you. It's like he knows exactly how you feel and he writes a song about it. He is just the most awesome songwriter/singer there is. I love Brian McKnight. If you like him and have been following his career in song, then you will love Win! He is still the best and I love him!
__label__2 Just what I was looking for: ... Despite the fact that the description says various artists, the songs are all sung by an unnamed female vocalist and never seems to grow tiring. Plenty of variety in songs and if you close your eyes and try just a bit you can imagine yourself strolling the Rues of the west bank. ... I believe the album was produced in Canada so I would not be surprised if the language is "Canadianized French" but believe me, I wouldn't know! Magnifique!
__label__1 This Gate is One Expensive Chew Toy: Well, seeing that I needed an extra wide gate, I had few choices, and this was the only one that would fit--the only reason I bought this gate. Bought last Dec (2006), the gate lasted all of 5 months. My little dog has chewed through the filmsy wooden slats and escaped. I would have fared better using boxes of rocks placed side by side to keep the pooch in the pen. Total waste of money!!
__label__1 Worst Movie Ever Can't Act: Talk about bad acting. Katie Homes should stick to Dawson's Creek like series and character. Since her movie career wasn't doing so well, she suddenly jumps up because Tom delusionally crazed scientology Cruise asks her hand in marriage. Give me a break. This is where hollywood really goes wrong. They both need psychiatric help!
__label__2 book worth buying: I highly recommend this book. I am an architecture student, and I have found this book to be interesting, useful, and full of great projects. The book does a nice job of talking about the history, uses, strengths, and weaknesses of building materials. The book is organized by material with building projects that utilize those particular materials in an innovating and interesting way. The photos are great and the detail drawings are very nice to see as well.
__label__1 yuck: By looking at the nutrition label, I figured this was one of the best affordable multi-vitamins around. When it arrived though, my thoughts changed. The pills smell awful, and by awful I mean absolutely disgusting! They are speckled with various brown and red coloring, and taste even worst then they smell. I was convinced they sent me a bottle that expired 10 years ago. I plan on finishing the bottle, but I usually cut them in half (because when tested with vinegar, they did not dissolve). I have never hated taking my vitamins this much!
__label__2 Great game, recommended for any RTS fans: I'm a big RTS fan and I have to say this game is a masterpiece. I liked the fact that each of the seven races has own unique ability. The game is pretty fast-paced, forcing the player to incessantly produce squad/units and upgrade them. The multiplayer is awesome, I had fun playing with my friends.
__label__2 kensington digital FM Radio & Transmitter: Product works very well. The key to clear reception is to find a channel with clear static. I have tried on all of my cars and my house radios with very good results.
__label__1 Great movie the first time...the unrated one's garbage: I loved this movie. That said, the unrated cut is completely thrown together, with several funny scenes from the original completely left out in favor of longer takes of other scenes. All the extras, however, are predictably hilarious. I'm selling this and rebuying the rated version.
__label__2 One of the great tragic novels: Mauriac, who won the 1952 Nobel Prize for literature, later said of Therese that what she needed was a priest-confessor who truly represented Christ. Since he (at the time of writing the novel) knew of no such person, he could only write of a woman who's passion cried out in futility for fulfillment. The novel takes place in three (maybe four?) vignettes, with Therese first being accused of poisoning her husband, then moving to Paris and becoming a lover of many men, and finally her one truest act of love toward a young man who is drawn to both her and to God. The novel may offend Christians (since there's no cute or easy ending), offend protestants (since Mauriac sees Christanity and Catholicism as synonyms), and offend non-believers (Mauriac, for all his literary brilliance, is a Jesus freak at heart). I recommend Therese (and Mauriac's other works, incl. the non-listed on Amazon "River of Fire,") most highly.
__label__1 Ugh..: A company of space pirates accidentally pick up a kid while on a raid. The kid fix their engine while they are attacked, and the pirates promise to send the kid home as thanks.The entire movie smells like a bad Star Wars rip-off, with a nearly non-existing budget for props or special effects. The acting is also sub-par.If you are looking for a good sci-fi movie, go somewhere else.If you happen to like bad sci-fi's, invite some friends and prepare yourselves for an MST3K experience.
__label__1 Movie's Most Popular Song Deleted: I first saw Westward Ho! The Wagons in a theatre when it first came out. In it was a song called Wringle Wrangle, sung by Fess Parker. I bought the video mainly so I could hear this song. Guess what? The song was not there! For some reason it has been deleted from the video. The video must have been made from a television print which was edited to fit the time slot of the Disneyland TV show. It even has fadeouts that seem to have been put there so commercials could be inserted. I was very disappointed. I always thought Disney videos were complete. The theatrical print was in CinemaScope. I hope they will release a DVD in widescreen format (2.35:1) that is complete.
__label__2 one of the best books: i have read all of the daughter of the moon books several timesthey are all totaly awesome.serena is getting possessed she is not acting like her self.you will not regret readingthese books i've allready gotten friends to read the books and one of my teachers wanted to read it!!!!!!!!!!
__label__2 Great little book: I bought this book more for the price than anything else, but was very pleasantly surprised with the content. It covers everything I needed. Now that our practice is becoming more 'online' as the pundits say, all of our MDs are requried to have an understanding of the internet. This little book allowed all of us to get online, understand what we were doing and get the information that our patient's have access to! Thanks!
__label__2 Quit Your Day Job: More Stars Please!! This is a 10 star book! Extremely educational and inspiring! It's a must read for anyone dreaming of a writer's career. If you want a precise and direct map from idea to publication -- this is it!
__label__1 Love the music, but not the way it was recorded.: I have always been a fan of Nelly Furtado's music and have enjoyed her previous albums. I really like "say it right" when I first heard it sometime ago, but thought that the radio station had a problem because the song was badly distorted on the bass and was clipping. But then I started hearing the same distortion on other copies and have found out that was the way it was "intentionally" recorded. Sorry, but to me that just ruined the song and left me wanting to hear the song the way it was really being performed in the studio before they botched it up in the mixing console. I am glad I found out this information before I bought the CD (which I almost did, but would have taken it back). It is sad to me that this is considered a good thing to do to this song and others. I guess this will be the only CD of her's that I will not be purchasing.
__label__2 Bad Instructions, easy setup, lots o' power!: Well, I received mine yesterday and hooked it up after work. As everyone says, the instructions are terrible, but they give you a general idea of what is going on. I used these sites to help with installation.[...][...]Also, if you have the valves open on the intake and output tubes, the canister will prime itself. I just hooked it up, the canister and tubes filled and I plugged it in. There wasn't even any air left in the canister. Very pleased so far!!
__label__1 Too Small: Sony DSC-F717 does NOT fit. Cannot comment on the other aspects of this item as it is going back to Amazon ASAP.
__label__2 The master: If I had a time machine, one of the first things I'd go see would be John Hammond's 1938 "Spirituals to Swing" concert. I would have given anything to be able to see Sonny Terry alone on the Carnegie Hall stage with just his harp.This album is about as close as we'll get to that wonderful image. With minimal guitar accompaniment, Sonny showed here why'd I'd rather listen to people like him than any other harmonica player you could name. Sonny Terry may not have had the musical dexterity of some later(OK, white)harp players. He may not have played the harp like Charlie Parker played the sax. But his music had something in back of it that was far more important. Real life.
__label__1 Seems to work OK but three big negatives: Arrived completely dead, messed around, finally figured out how to open and change batteries, then worked. I.e., the installed batteries were completely dead. Also the printing for the range switch is very dark green on black, just cannot be read without a flashlight and young eyes (which mine are not). The AC current range maxes at 0.2 amps, so not useful for measuring measuring the draw of common stuff such as small devices and/or their chargers. I would send it back if it were not so cheap to begin with.
__label__1 Live It Up: Being a CSN fan from the beginning this album is certainly not their best work, but it is still worthy of inclusion in any CSN collection. David Crosby's "Arrows" is the highlight of this album for me. "Arrows is truly an underrated song!
__label__1 Worked great, until it didn't...: I purchased one of these about a week before Hurricane Gustav came through Baton Rouge, not even thinking about ever using it to clear off down trees. I thought it would be better to get an electric model and not have to fool with gas and oil. That was a mistake. After the rain stopped, I ended up carting a generator around in a wheelbarrow to use the chainsaw.When it had power, the chainsaw worked great. I could cut through just about anything a gas model would cut. The only problem with the generator was that the saw would trip the overload protection when cutting though large branches (over 10 or so inches).After about 3 or 4 hours of use, the unit just stopped working. I cleaned out the bar, thinking something had jammed it, but no. It was dead. It was a huge bummer to have it die while I was cleaning out the yard. I have returned it and purchased a gas model. If you live in storm prone areas, stay away from electric!!!
__label__1 a joke: anything on master ps label is a disgrace to hip-hop. Master P is the worst rhymer and delivers his raps in a truly unattractive drawl. Never innovative or creative, master p releases another joke for an album. If you want some true southern rap, get outkast or goodie mob.don't get me wrong, I didnot buy this album, but i've heard it.

__label__1 No quality, buy something else: Needs a better pysical description, only about 12" tall and only the red lights work, definately not good quality and too much of a pain to ship back for the price. I recommend you buy something else.
__label__2 Heftier than it Appears: Judging from the other reviews, some people use this drop cloth material to make curtains. Perhaps an artist would disagree, but it looks good for use as a canvas for painting. At any rate it definitely works to cover floors and furniture for painting the house.A strong double hem surrounds the perimeter of this material and I tied loops with string at each corner, to have tie down capability. I use this drop cloth outside to cover freshly epoxied surfaces for protection from UV sunlight.The cloth could make table cloths, too.
__label__1 What the heck?: I remember watching this when it first came out, I was maybe 6 or 7 at the time. Because of my obsession to the award winning video game, I rented the movie. I brought it home and I watched, I thought it was the BEST movie in the world. A few days ago, I remembered back to this movie, and I remembered how much I had loved it as a kid, so I went and bought it. Unfortunaltly when I watched it, my reaction was VERY different from the one I had six years ago. I probably enjoyed the movie so much at the time because I was young and I didn't know how to critique movies. Well, now, six years later, this is my opinion, if you want a true blue authentic Street Fighter movie, go rent, or even buy, Street Fighter 2: The Animated Movie. Or even better, buy the unedited Japanese version with English subtitle. I don't even think this "live-action" version of the movie deserved a 1 star rating, maybe a .05.
__label__1 worked ok at first... now unusable: This product worked fine when I first bought it. Batteries charged in 1 hour, very convenient.HOWEVER, after a few months I started having problems. I would charge the batteries for 1 hour, until the indicator lights indicated that they were fully charged. But when I tried to use the batteries in my camera, they depleted after only a few minutes of use. The batteries also depleted quite rapidly when not in use, they were dead after about one day unused.I do not know whether the problem is with the batteries or with the charger, but this product is now unusable.
__label__2 God Street Wine - Good to the last Drop: Now no longer together, this is the best GSW Album. This album was recorded from the last show ever in New York City. The 2 Disc collection contains old, new and cover tunes that are done in classic God Street Wine Style. If you follow Phish, Grateful Dead, or the likes you will definately want to buy this CD!
__label__1 Not worth A million dollars!!!: I tried this, and after paying $1,000,000 for it, I have to say it's not worth it! There are so many cheaper ones out there. I was hoping for 24K gold dust or something. Boy was I duped!!
__label__1 TOO HOT!!!!!: Had the water problem as stated by other consumers. Waterpuddle in front of slow cooker and on the floor. Slip and falldanger. Not a small puddle at all.ALSO MAJOR temp problem. On LOW, my meat cooked in about half the time. 6 hours (3.5 lb. pot roast) recipe was for 10-12 hours. The warm feature was set by the manufacturer,still continued to cook my meal. Dangerous situation to say the least.The Hot temp on low and the water spewing everywhere happened with 2 different Rival pots. returned both.,
__label__2 I like this . . . . .: "Who Made Who"? No not the ACDC album, but Who Made Who, the band, from . . . . . . Scandinavia? Well anyways, this album is solid throughout, it was well produced and it sounds like the group actually play instruments to compliment their electronic edge. But if you're looking for something loud and easy to 'wig' out to, I would not get this. But if you are looking for something easy, funky, well crafted, and overall really fun . . . . . please, please check this out!
__label__2 Possibly his best to date: We went to great lengths to find a rental, as they were all but sold out a week before Christmas.
__label__2 more life than original supplied battery: My dell supplied battery died every year...stress. When I bought this battery I was amazed how long it lasted. Much longer than the original battery. Has the battery meter like the original so you can easily check the amount of charge is in the battery without turning it on. nice
__label__1 Alpha Video DVD picture quality is terrible: You can always count on Alpha Video to be totally inconsistent when it comes to the quality of their DVDs; some are beautiful and crystal clear... others are terrible. Romance on the Range is definitely terrible video quality. The picture is so bad it looks like it was mastered from a second generation VHS tape. I can't believe Alpha would put out such an inferior product. Don't waste your money!
__label__2 great cd: i love this cd. great rock for christian music. the tunes get stuck in your head and you have to keep listening to it!
__label__1 the most unlikable heroine i've ever read: loved _The Last Viking_ and thought i'd try another of hers. i only made it 100pages in and couldn't take the petty self serving crass cheating loudmouth anymore. Ms. Hill- strong women don't have to be such jerks!
__label__1 Is this the best author for the job?: After going through parts of The Urantia Book and finding kernels of truth, and an underlying consistency in the overall message, I found Martin Gardner's book a bit disturbing. It seemed as if his mind was made up well before his investigation into this text. An authors bias can run through his/hers work in a negative way. I do not know Mr. Gardner, but it seemed there was a surprising amount of anger and negativity involved here. Most pages had numerous negative references in an attacking manner. In the end it was too emotional and not professional enough to rely on.
__label__1 Transformer?: Unplayable - appeared to be blank. Did not play on any DVD player. It was sealed as described but I won't order from this vendor again.
__label__1 Great earbuds while it lasted - wires that is...: Well I bought these 71's because of the sound quality I read about during the opinions. I planned to use these for my MTB rides and around town. Well when I got them they worked like a champ - at least for the first few months...then I noticed something happening to the wire's jacket near the buds - they were turning dirty and softer than the surrounding jacket further down the wire.A few weeks later the jacket was stretching and looks now like it wants to peel off the inner wire!That is the bad side of the earbuds from SONY.THe only good thing I can report is that the sound is the best for the price and they fit my small ear canal. I have bought others and they do not fit as well than SONYs...but with this very major issue with the wiring jacket peeling away from the wiring, I am staying away from SONY.Going to try out the V-moda Bass Freq. The cost is similar to the SONYs, I just hope that the wiring jacket last longer than Sony's.
__label__1 DOGGGG: THIS BREAD MAKER IS THE WORST AND ONLY ONE I HAVE OWNED THAT WILL NOT MIX BREAD EVENLY.THE DOUBLE PADDLES PUT DISAPPORTIONED AMOUNTS OF FLOOR AND YEAST INTO BOTHSIDES OF THE PAND RESULTING IN A TORPEADO SHAPED LOAF OF BREAD. HIGH SIDE TO LOW SIDE, NOT EVEN ON TOPDONT BUY
__label__1 Typical Zane (the writer) knock off...: When I thurst to read novels of fresh writers, I expect a bang of excitement and little nuances of reknown writers. Excited yes, original no. If I could, I'd say this writer loathes those little stories of love in Essence magazines, jumps for joy when E. Lynn Harris releases a new book, first one in line at a Zane book signing and quite obviously dissects the pages of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels. OK attempt though no dice. The book starts out in one century, ends in another with no segway or a rather confusing connection aside from love, to eachother. The first few chapters could have been done away with. I believe in imagery, though a fictional presence for the imagination would have helped in summing up an attempt of showing people falling in love in one decade or the other. Needless to say, I've seen and read this story before.
__label__1 Wish I'd Waited for the Paperback!: In her most recent Amelia Peabody books, including this one, the author has used an annoying literary device of breaking the momentum of the narrative to insert "Manuscript" and diary segments from other characters. Why she doesn't just spin the next generation of characters into another series, instead of diluting the otherwise still-alluring plot and setting, is a mystery. I bought this book, as all the others, in hardback. The next book will either be borrowed from a library or purchased at a paperback exchange, and my money will go for another more deserving new mystery writer.
__label__2 Better than Rage Against the Machine!: "Laced" by Reveille sounds only somewhat like Rage Against the Machine. They are angrier and rock harder. This band from Massachusetts would fit nicely in a CD collection featuring Rage Against the Machine, Korn, (hed) pe, or anything else that rocks. All of their songs are powerful and rich in quality. The song "Splitt (Comin' Out Swingin')" even features B Real of Cypress Hill while other excellent songs include "Rise and Blind," "Dark Horizons," "The Phoenix," and "Permanent (Take a Look Around)." This CD is a must buy!
__label__1 wasn't right: The book inside the bag was correct.The parts inside the bag did not match the book.The book drawings would have worked.So I bought one off of Ebay and it was correct.
__label__2 I need to buy this album again: I purchased this CD a long time ago when it came out. I love it. Jennifer has such an amazing voice! great backing musicians, Basically Trey's band minus Trey) fantastic CD highly recommended. If you find mine.....please send it home!
__label__2 Great watch. Band adjustments tricky: I suggest going to the internet to get the best explanation of adjusting the tricky, but cool mesh watch band...
__label__2 Great book: This book combines different theories and compares them with one another. If one would like to understand the differences between traditional psychoanalysis, attachment, and self-psychology, this book is a must.
__label__1 Awful: "The best western since Tombstone" huh? Not bloody likely. Shadowheart follows a revenge-driven man (Justin Ament) seeking vengeance upon the amoral Will (Angus MacFadyen) for the death of his father (William Sadler) years before. He returns to the town he grew up in and re-acquaints himself with a lost love (Marnie Alton). What really hurts Shadowheart more than anything is the ultra-cliche nature of it all. Everything featured in this film has been seen in plenty of westerns before it, and done much, much better as a result. The film is so predictable from beginning to end, and it way too long in running time to boot. Seriously, it doesn't take too long until it feels like torture getting through this film. The horrible acting and sloppy direction don't help matters here either. All in all, Shadowheart is by and far something worth avoiding. No matter how much you may love the western genre, do yourself a favor and avoid this film.
__label__1 HTR22-2U is too noisy for Home Theatre use.: If you are looking for a UPS/Power Conditioner for Home Theatre use, Do Not buy the HTR22-2U, unless you can place it in a totally soundproof room! I purchased it because its technical specs seemed outstanding. However, once I received it, placed it into my Home Theatre rack, and turned it on, I couldn't believe the noise levels put out by the cooling fan. I turned my TV volume up to 80 (out of 100) and could still hear the HTR22 over the TV. It was louder than the TV in the adjacent room, as well. And, the fan runs all the time.I checked with Tripp Lite and they confirmed that this unit is noisy. So unless you have a sonically isolated room for your equipment, the HTR22 is not suitable.
__label__1 audiobook review: Packer writes this book not as a treatise on G-d, but his own admission, even though its length greatly suggests such. Packer considers this to be a series of small studies concerning G-d, as separate messages, but provided a whole in this audio book edition, narrated by Simon Vance.Vance provides a husky voice, presented in a discussion format. Vance does an excellent job at proper intonation, inflection, and authentic reading. Small groups will identify will with the narration, but find struggle keeping up with the material. In truth, this book, in itself, is evidence that audio books will never replace traditional format books (to be read, that is, not necessarily printed). Greatly complex, this book is not suited well for audio, despite the narrator's best attempts.Read the score, disclosures, and more at scriptedgenius (dot) com.
__label__1 POOPY: This item sucked. Opened it and it worked for ONE day. I tried using it again and it wouldn't work.It's in tact, it just doesn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS! I mean it was cheap. Just crappy.Sorry bro.
__label__1 Predictable and boring: If you can make it past the first few chapters to meet all the characters, then you don't need to finish the book because you can predict the rest. I think Ms. Steel needs to spend more time coming up with a new idea and less time trying to crank out a book every 6 months.
__label__2 Can a book with an orgy be that bad?: I have just finished reading Caryl Churchill's infamous play "Cloud Nine". I found the book to be an amazing tool to present to the reader those social issues which we have so desperately tried to sweep under the bed. The book is actually a play through which her use of a Brechtian style of theater keeps the reader in a sort of shocked confusion and not very comfortable. At first glance you might say it is vulgar and rude, yet a deeper evaluation proves that this play is an effective tool to dredge up what society has sunk to the bottom of the river.
__label__1 Why are they going off?: Can't believe they've left so many interesting plots from previous seasons of MAD MEN undeveloped. How did Duck Philips lose out after SC was acquired by the Brits? How did the "Quitting Tobacco" letter written by Draper help or not help the Agency? Old man Cooper packed up and left after the "Letter" fiasco and just returned without any explanation of how? They had this interesting way of going back in time to explain stuff. Why have they stopped doing that? Is that the end of Dr Miller? Is that the end of Carla who seemed to know so much about the Draper household? How about Peggy's struggles with her faith? Pete's feelings for her and the child together. The list goes on. They need to concentrate more on the emotional relationships between all these characters and Don's mesmerizing talent as an Ad Man to keep viewers' interest. The first three episodes of season 5 have been way below par. The show is loosing it's appeal.
__label__2 Not perfect but:: If you are going to collect 3rd Reich militaria this book is a must. The biggest drawback is the lack of short glossary explaining some of the terms and how to determine certain kinds of metal. For example: if an item is made out of "tombak" how do I differentiate that from zinc or aluminium. All photos in B&W, color would have been nice. All this aside this book seems to be the best book on the market on the subject.
__label__2 Great Historical Fiction!: When my mother first asked me to read SKP's The Sunne In Splendour a year ago, I was none too thrilled to be putting upon myself the task of reading a 1,000 page book. But since then, I'm determined to read everything this wonderful author has written! When Christ And His Saints Slept transforms the reader back in time to 12th Century England. The three main characters that SKP focuses on are Maude (Henry I's daughter), Ranulf (a fictional but well-thought out character), and the future Henry II. We also meet a young Eleanor of Aquitane, who really makes a grand entrance into the story towards the end. My only criticism is that sometimes the Welsh names and places are hard to read and remember. The medieval language coupled with a modern sense of humor makes this novel an exciting read. It's hard to put it down once you get into it!
__label__1 No Singing: I love Chris Rice but was severly disappointed with this purchase. It has no singing at all. That's right. None! And the worst part? No where on the CD jacket do you find any hint that its all piano. Very deceptive.
__label__1 I have to agree with previous posts concerning CDset: Well I have also had to read the listening,speaking and writing parts of the book in the end in answers.and it's not the same as to listen to it as I'll have to do on my TOEFL test:(The CD accompanieing the book was very good but only after I staretd to do some listening parts I noticed on the back of the book that there should be 8 more CD disks.And as I opened the CD already.I mean I torn the envelope with CD I coudln't even return the book.The book itself seems to be a very good one.But without 8 more CDset it's not such a good preparational material for listening, writing and speaking sections.And I need to train mainly in speaking, writing and listening.
__label__2 Entertaining for young readers (and their parents!): My wife and I secured "Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" at a book fair at school. Our two boys loved listening to it. We read it often enough that we only had to pause for a moment to have the boys (in unison) insert the title phrase. We then obtained the other two titles contained in this book. We read them so much, we wore out the paperback bindings, so I bought the hard cover collection. The narratives, written in first persion tense, would also make excellent speaking parts for those school talent shows. The stories are simple, yet entertaining. Having two boys, I see a little of Alexander in each of them.
__label__1 la Crosse warranty service is fake.: I sent my BC-90009 for warranty repair.I've been told that unit is backorder and I'll get replacement after 6(six!) months or they can send me MUCH CHEAPER BC700.With no other option I agreed to get BC700.
__label__1 Drain cleaning tool: I was surprised to see how long this item was, plus it was a one-time only use item. This was not indicated anywhere in the descriptions of the object before I decided to buy. I did use it, and, either the drain wasn't clogged enough, or the tool missed the clog.
__label__1 Sub-par attempt at Wizard of Oz: I previewed this movie for my 5 year old after all the great reviews I saw on Amazon... This movie has poor production. The shifting from black and white to color was not explained but just happens.Then it is down right scary!Walking across the grave yard at midnight comes out ok but I'm curious Why can't light go with them? No real reason is given.the script is poor and pathetic. The lines these children were made to say makes me shutter...Someone raved about the grandma scene.. It teaches your child to think Grandma is only "alive" when you think about her. Yuck! Why lay that burden on a childs' shoulders.Oh and BTW all babies are pretty and caucasion before being born.The big fire scene is really frighting.Not to mention the script writer must have hated cats!This is not a movie for Cat lovers.I can understand why I had never heard of this movie.The production writing and acting leave a whole bunch to be desired.
__label__2 It really is comforting: I have come back to this book time and time again during my pregnancy. It really enjoy that it offers a sense of humor and is light-hearted while it also is honest about challenges. It suggests writing assignments and self-nurturing home projects that I never was interested in doing BUT just reading about the common experiences of women was really helpful. Reading this, I never felt alone in what I was feeling.
__label__2 Great textbook: This is a high-quality textbook for undergraduate and graduate students in public health and health sciences fields. It should be one of the main references for any health researcher or practitioner as well.
__label__2 Pop-Tarts, Chocolate Vanilla Creme: I would like for them to bring back this pop tart (Pop-Tarts, Chocolate Vanilla Creme) Why do companies always mess with something good? There are to many people searching for this flavor. Bring it BACK!!!! PLEASE
__label__2 One of the best Soundtracks: I dare anyone not to tap there foot while listening to this CD. The only track to moderatley lose it's luster in the transistion is "They Both Reached for the Gun" and that's due to the show stopper of a number in the film. The CD does what it's supposed to: captures the feel of the movie and makes you want to see it again. The last two "Bonus" track are good, but they make a hard turn in a different genre so be prepared. That aside, definitely worth buying.
__label__2 Beach Music and More: This CD is a must have for summer! It includes beach favorites, and fun tracks such as "Jump Jive N Then You Wail" and "Margaritaville". This is a wonderful CD to add to your collection!!
__label__2 Harry Potter Fan: Because I have followed Harry Potter from the beginning to the end and I hope there will be one about their kids.
__label__2 Pretty Decent: I used to be obbsessed with BIzkit, but now its Good charlotte(big change). This cd is good, but what really makes it are Almost Over, Build A Bridge, Underneath the Gun,and Down another Day. I am not that in to the metal side of them anymore. If you like metal you will like most of this album. If you like softer nicer songs you will like 25% of this album. My friends want me to sell this cd to them and i say no. even though i am not into limp bizkit that much, this is a very good album.
__label__1 Smells like burning plastic: The fan fills my home with a very strong odor of burning plastic each time I turn it on. I do like the design and strength of the unit but the odor of burnt plastic is headache-inducing and annoying.
__label__2 A nice product!: Works very well! Removes all caked-on film from glasses. Pricey but it works.NOTE: no instructions on the bottle. Not sure if it is intended to be used full strength or diluted.
__label__2 Bob Sargent Shines: I just met Bob at the Audobon Hummingbird Festival near Memphis. He bands over 800 birds a year, and is such a giving caring man. Proceeds from this book help the Hummingbird cause. Fabulous pictures and full of information.
__label__1 Ick: I bought this when my son was older (like one year old), none of the information was relevant because we were past all the stages covered in the book. I also thought the writing was pretty blah. This book went to Goodwill right away. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!: are you people retarded? why do you listen to this crap? it's just fabricated 80's music. utter crap.ugh...ugh...ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 pretty bad: Rented this movie because am a Kevin Smith fan and the reviews souned great. This movie is more like a high school film production and therefore probably only can be enjoyed by those involved in the making of it. If you are a 15 year old boy who just discovered Catcher in the rye you might really enjoy it.I was bored,it wasn't funny,best to describe is stupid.
__label__1 SO-SO CD By JOE the Artists: I Think Joe could have done a better job as far as the song are concern on the CD AIN't Nothin' LIKE ME because From the last CD to this one I think it took about a year to record this one.What I,m trying to say is I,m a fan of Joe,s an I,m from his home town Columbus,GA I expected something with a lot more energy,drive,carizma.Maybe two or three song that would make ya get up on the dance floor and do the don thing know what I mean!But this CD don,t got it.(Sorry Joe)Maybe next time
__label__1 Mark Atkins needs to be brought up on charges!: Not even a B movie. Copied parts from Independence Day, E.T., even some of the music from The Terminator, to name a few. And seriously, a woman with a sword, seriously. Mark Atkins' name needs to be remembered, so you won't be ripped off again.
__label__1 Very difficult book to understand and made me dislike Calculus.: The primary problem with this book is it does not explain the concept using more then a cryptic 1/2 page of text. It then proceeds to bombard you with examples that make virtually no sense because you will most likely not fully understand the concept. This method is repeated over and over again.I also had the impression that the example problems were overly complex and instead of demonstrating the concept being taught, they added unnecessary complexity for complexity sake.I am a fan of the building block method of learning where you keep a subject simple until it is mastered and then you build upon it. This book does not follow that process.Lastly, if you are purchasing this book I would recommend you try to find other sources from your local library to reinforce your learning.
__label__2 Great book: This is a must read for anyone anxious to know the historical Jesus. The author's insights are priceless and the research seems to be very thorough.
__label__1 THIS BOOK IS LAME: this book is all pictures and very little substance - who put this thing together? very slight and amaturish. this guy is lame.
__label__1 Everything for the Church Soloist: 100+ pages were missing from this music book. You have already approved my return of this product and this is the second time I have filled out this questionnaire. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
__label__2 Long time favorite: My husband has loved this movie for a long time. After we watched it,I could see why. The writing and acting are excellent. A really fun movie!
__label__1 OK: I have been studying the energy depletion for some time and didn't feel that this book added anything to what I have already read. I also thought that it was not as comprensive and complete as other books.
__label__2 Perfect: I use this mouse with both my laptop and my desktop and it I have to say it works great with both. No software and no tricky installation make it very easy to use. Just plug it in and go.
__label__1 Not intersting for my dog and smells strong: I bought this toy for my dog a few months ago and she does not care for it and it smells really strong like rubber. I tried to put treats in it and peanut butter and a mix of both. My dog still didn't care for it. Washing it doesn't help either.
__label__2 Pacific Fun Tube: My grandchildren love this tunnel and played with it all evening when we exchanged gifts. It appears to be durable. It's easy to store since it folds flat.
__label__1 Not Impressed: This is the first book by Zane that I have read and I must say that she is not as imaginative as I expected. After reading the first story "First Night", I almost put the book down because I was neither impressed with the writing style nor the sex descriptions. They were both so ordinary! I hoped it would get better as I continued reading, but after the fourth story, the sex descriptions became overly repetitious and the supporting imagery did not help much. I must say that my imaginations are a lot more fun & creative. I was not impressed with the book at all and I have returned it.
__label__1 Not at all what I expected.: While at the beginning I enjoyed what seemed to be a very different, manic, poetic take on Tokyo, I soon found myself skimming entire paragraphs and pages of non-sequitur. The author's descriptions are inaccurate at times and ludicrous at others. How exactly could FujiTV be "under" you as you travel the Rainbow Bridge? Hikarigaoka, desolate?And how is it that more half the description of Shibuya could be only about the pervasiveness of English in Tokyo? Avant-garde, yes, and I was thrilled to see someone invest such rich description in a book about the city I so love, but Mr. Barber's Tokyo is clearly very different from mine. Perhaps a more jaded expat than I would find it good reading rather than slowly infuriating, but hard to say.If you are looking for a travel book (as this seems to be erroneously labeled, both on its cover and in the section of the library where I happened across it), look elsewhere.
__label__2 Great stuff: I love this popcorn. It does pop smaller but it's really tasty and barely any kernels to get stuck in your gums lol.
__label__2 Impressive Debut: Despite an utter lack of support from the genre press and even his own publishers, Bentley Little has quietly blossomed into one of horror's best and most consistent writers. This is a re-release of his first book, and while it's obviously a first novel and is not as good as his recent work, Little's trademark mix of horror, social consciousness and black humor is still much in evidence. So is his ability to create strong characters. All in all, an impressive debut.
__label__2 Dark Shadows DVD: Unexpectedly funny. Not quite like the original TV series. Johnny Depp portraied the vampire hexed by a witch and returned from the grave after a few hundred years to get even and find a new family and a new love. Just the right amount of humor.
__label__1 Just broke on the first use: Got the toy out and washed it being very careful to not get anything wet that did not need to get wet. Added the batteries. Started to use it and it broke after five minutes. I have changed the batteries and looked for any signs of defectiveness. It is perfect but the motor simply stopped.
__label__2 Great Product: This is a very well made four loaf pan, but beware of sharp edges. I purchased this for my daughter so that she could make breads for a church bake sale. It worked out great especially since it cuts the baking time down considerably.
__label__2 The gift that keeps on giving: I have used this knife as a gift on many occasions. It is a true must for any serious cook or chef. The best knife I have ever used, and I use it all the time for everything.
__label__1 Looks great and great quality but terribly uncomfortable: I purchased in 2009 for my first child. He wouldn't sleep on it ever. I thought it was just him being difficult. Now for my second child who slept through the night in a pack n play from day 1: when we put him in the crib he fusses and is up every half hour. He slept through the night perfectly when visiting my parents on their sealy crib mattress so we bought a cheap new mattress and he's sleeping perfectly. The starlight supreme is simply as hard as a rock.
__label__2 Grandson's must have: Ordered for my Grandson's who has a wide collection of the Munster's series which I purchased for them in the past; this was part of their Christmas package.
__label__1 Eat Pray Love: I was very disappointed in the book especially after seeing the author on The Oprah Show. Most of the audience along with Oprah "gushed" over the book and I felt I just had to read it and give it to my daughter. I forced myself to read and finish it and wondered the whole time---what is the point???Too much hipe!!!! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
__label__1 FIRST 80 MINUTES OF 2 HOURS ARE GOOD: The fights and chases, and Barbara Bach, and Hammer's Caroline Munro, are nice---it's the climax that stinks!The explosions and shoot-outs on board a super tanker are as boring as the climatic oil rig nonsense of DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (another Bond movie where the lead-up is a lot better than the climax).Ken Adams' super tanker set is a throw back to the 1960s, and not in a nice way; it looks like a reject from a '60 spy movie. The red uniforms for the villain's crew are also a leftover from '60s tackiness.The first 80 minutes of this movie are worth watching a number of times. The last 40 minutes can be skipped, thanks to modern science.UNDER SEIGE, a Steven Segal movie, is a better directed, and more exciting thriller set on board a ship.
__label__1 Really a waste of money.: Beware of authors who cannot spell "degradation" and beware of programmers who cannot write 6 lines of code that return what they say it will. There must be something better out there.
__label__1 don't waste your money: this card requires the use of a memory manger program that must be loaded before any games can be played. and even after following the instructions perfectly, i still couldn't get it to work. guessing the card was defective...but regardless, i returned it and paid the extra money for the sony card.
__label__1 A good idea that's gone haywire: No one can blame an enthusiastic stockbroker for trying to devise a program to help rehabilitate drunkards. OK, so the drunks are sober, that's great, but what can be done to help them find real mental and emotional health? In effect, the Big Book and the religion which sprang from it recreates the Christian model (though somewhat camouflaged and customized for alcoholics). Sin, confession, prayer, redemption... in many ways, the Big Book leads alcoholics back to church, but through the "back door", and with "blind folds" on. The stories of personal recovery are great, albeit dated, but the steps and the religosity have started quite a bit of controversy. (e.g. why is the DISEASE of alcoholism the only known disease with a religious solution?) Before committing one's life to the practices outlined in this book, it might be wise to acquaint oneself with both the pro and the con sides of the "religious solution for alcoholics" argument.
__label__2 "The whole album is kind of mad...": "...and it's surreal". If you call yourself a prog fan, you have to listen to this inspired musical journey. Words cannot do justice to this. Buy it now proggers to experience the wonder of Bungle.
__label__1 well...: Well seeing as I do like Destiny's child (Original first).. But this dvd/video was a waste of time and energy. Not to mention money. Everything that you see on it DVD/VHS.. if things you can record off the TV your darn self. lol. But if you like to see video from beginning to end maybe you'll like this... Oh yeah.. Ever notice that the "platinums" on the wall, on the video/dvd are all with the original members....I thought it was just me.
__label__2 What an imagination!: Clever, well written . Keeps your attention because you need to know what on earth could happen next! Wonderful dialog.......and Richard Parker....what a tiger!?!
__label__2 Fine as a reference: Arden's edition of Shakespeare's works is an essential item in everyone's shelter. It's a great buy (for a carefully sought edition), but it lacks the critical discussion of the single-play edition.
__label__1 Deceptive Picture - Advertising I Believe: Picture on the web site as viewed when ordering showed OEM box for ink cartridges. What arrived WAS NOT OEM packaged ink cartridges - but generic cartridges. Have not installed yet as present cartridge is not empty or not in need of change-out.Concerned these generic cartridges will present issues when used, such as clogging of print heads, etc. Disappointed but not willing to spend my money to ship back.
__label__1 too small: was way smaller than what it claimed. my daughter is a size 5t or small and this was extremely short on her! the headband barely fit around her doll! I returned it~
__label__2 A great cookbook to own: I first came across this cookbook when I was browsing for a low-fat cookbook. The title seemed so uninspiring to me - low fat, low cholesterol - how boring was this food going to be? I can't believe that I almost didn't buy it because I was too quick to judge it by its cover. These recipes are really delicious. And interspersed throughout the book are great tips on how to cut the fat out of your cooking (such as rinsing cooked ground beef ). The book is in a nice spiral hardbound and includes the nutritional information for each recipe. I've already recommended it to quite a few people.
__label__1 Bad Book: I did not enjoy this book. I thought it was boring and not well writen at some points. The part of this book that I liked was the end because Winnie died and I didn't like her.
__label__1 Seems like a budget title to me.: This dvd looks like one of those versions you would find in a .99 cent store. If you are a Fraidy cat fan and want an official and nice picture/sound version the only one I seen is on the Frightfully Funny Collection Volume 2. Just do an Amazon dvd search and it'll come up. It's still for sale but could go out of print at any time. You also get 2 more discs, one of Groovie Goolies and Ghostbusters, two other filmation shows.
__label__2 Stories that adults and children can enjoy together!: These stories are all top notch. My favorite "Vengeance and Wrath" is haunting and original. A children's book, that is fascinating for both adults and children. GREAT!
__label__2 Cool strap, just one flaw: This is a decent strap, goes well with the Gretsch guitar. Thick leather that seems very durable. The stamps add a nice western vibe, and the buckle adjust is fine so far (had about 1 month). Within a couple weeks one of the faux jewels fell off. I super'd it back on, so no big deal. I don't expect those to last long. So long as the metal parts don't bend or snap, and the leather doesn't tear, I'm satisfied.
__label__2 Very handy: I'm a Line mechanic and I use thus everyday at work and home. A great Tool for everything. Only drawl back is the cutter is not the greatest for stripping wire. I would buy this again if I lost it.
__label__2 First CD I bought: A few good songs on here. The most popular was "She's So Huge" however I enjoyed Holiday Man the most for it's more up sound. Not sure why I originally bought it but I think it was for the cool album cover.
__label__1 Is this the state of modern horror writing? Uh-oh.: I picked up The Darker Side with the hope of exploring new, young authors in the horror genre. Unfortunately, if these writers are representative of current horror trends, then the whole genre is on the verge of collapse. The anthology's first story was the best, and there were occasional authors who showed a flash of talent, but overall, the stories alternated between boring and horrible. There was nothing remotely frightening or disturbing in any story in the book. Instead, many of the authors seemed to devote their energy to creating "adult" (i.e. poorly written sexual) material or over-the-top and substandard descriptions of murder instead of creating a decent story. At times, I wondered how these stories could be a credit to an author's reputation. If you want chilling and effectively written horror, there's always Poe and Lovecraft. Unfortunately, no author in this compilation comes close to their abilities.
__label__1 A Farce: Coppola gets back to his B-movie, soft-porn roots. This movie is absurd in every respect. Nevermind that it's a bastardazation of Bram Stoker's work; the real problems of this film are in the execution. The horrible acting, the campy sets, the Rocky Horror/ MTV costumes, the forced dialoge, the disjointed scenes, the random meaningless occurances... the whole thing comes across as parody! Throw in a few one-liners and this could be passed off as a Mel Brooks movie. Ugh!
__label__1 Worst battery I have ever seen: Battery discharges only in 30 minutes of talking. I personally never recommend this item. Answering machine is good but battery is worst.
__label__1 Junk: I have to admit, I read all of the negative reviews and purchased it anyway.This toy is a piece of junk. Aside from agreeing with the other reviewers who say it falls apart and is basically useless as a "garage", our particular toy came out of the box already broken. It doesn't make any sound. Unfortunately the receipt is long gone and I cannot return it to the store. Such a disappointment for my boys, too, because they were so excited by the picture on the box. But I absolutely refuse to spend money on a replacement.If you're like me and feel the urge to buy this toy despite the bad reviews, do your homework and find the lowest possible price first. I would say that spending more than [...] on this is a total waste of your hard earned dollars.My boys still play with the little cars, and my two year old gets a kick out of lifting the elevator, but I regret sinking money into something I was warned about.
__label__2 Great for what it is.: Speakers are weak, but for desk or office use, it's perfect. Great value at current price.
__label__1 Frustrating: In fact, for those of us who learned to type by touch using our right hand for the "6" key, this is VERY frustrating. Microsoft has ignored this complaint from users for a long time.
__label__2 Good Starter: This book is a good starter for understanding how to numerically solve (Partial Differential Equations)PDE's. The chapters are arranged in an orderly manner and hints are provided then and there so that you wont need to switch back and forth between them. I myself a researcher in the field of Finite Element Analysis, which extensively involves PDE's for implementing the Finite element model. A thorough knowlegde of PDE's and the nature of their solutions is very important for such fields. This book is definitely the one which describes the nature of PDE's solutions and their interpretation, boundedness and applicability.
__label__1 Nice swivel screen: That's the good part. You can rotate it in any direction, which means you can view it in a variety of situations. Let's see - oh yeah, the sound on the player is nice.Now the bad part? The LCD screen died after 1 year, and they wanted as much to fix it as the cost of a new player.Not worth buying for 1 year of ownership - and I really took care of it.
__label__2 My Idol: Clay Aiken's Bridge Over Trouble Water/This is the Night is the most anticipated CD in years and it doesn't disappoint. Bridge is powerful and This is the Night is melodious and Clay's voice is magnificent.Have to stop writing - must go listen!
__label__2 Pretty good, overall: Having to set up a total of four of these controllers, it was a little fun getting the right pad sync'd with the right receiver, but once that was done they worked just fine. As usual, the Logitech stuff is pretty good, and if I need more I'll be happy to use this product again!
__label__1 Good sound, bad quality: Compared to the stock earphones they are great. The bass is much more noticeable, and the same mp3 will come out richer and more enjoyable to hear. However, these broke down on me in a week. And I just used it like any regular person would.
__label__1 not the "real" timbuk 3: so how does this guy manage to get on amazon as "timbuk 3" when he's totally unrelated to the original pat & barbara k macdonald version of timbuk 3? if this sort of name-filching behavior is permitted, i expect his next album to be as "led zeppelin". seriously dude, we all know it's a clever name but please find your own.
__label__2 SOG Specialty Knives & Tools F01T Tactical Tomahawk: Well made, light, and I fully expect it to perform as advertised in it's utility role. I wish it came with a holder that allowed quicker access but I'll make do.
__label__1 Books are great, but O.O: Seriously, at the very least Anne of Green Gables should be part of every middle school reading list, but is the 18-21 blonde on the cover supposed to be Anne Shirley? Last time I checked, and correct me if I'm wrong because it's been a while since I've read the books, isn't she supposed to be an 11 or 12 year old Redhead with freckles? Seriously publishers! A bad cover like this is going to get walloped on because: 1) Fans already have all the books 2) Those who've heard of the books and would be getting them for the first time are going to be turned off by the cover and 3) People judging the book by the cover will be disappointed about not hearing about the blonde they have on the cover. Really, Buy the books, JUST NOT THIS EDITION!!!
__label__1 Oops-Did I Spend Money On This?: Even Britney's weak Baby One More Time CD sounds better than Brittney's sopomore album. I was very, very disappointed with this CD. The songs were weak and lacking in everythimg-vocals, lyrics, rythem...most of them aren't the slightest bit catchy! I bought the CD for the famed "Oops I Did It Again", and am now heartily sorry I wasted my money. . .
__label__1 Save your money: The first chapter of this book "Stupid Chivalry" must be read by every man. It is a great eye opener, which explains how stupid we can be when we try to fix broken women or when we try to care for them. Damsels in distress, according to the author, are "evil witches" who are "the architects of their own misery."The rest of the book I found insulting. I felt irritated when I was reading on almost every page "you guys... you guys", and the word "stupid" as a title for every chapter.How was she hoping to influence someone while insulting him is beyond me. Most other self-growth books respect their readers; this book does not. The author of this book is, virtually, bullying her readers.
__label__1 a review: I was very disappointed on hearing just one cut from this album. It seems Matheney hasn't evolved any since "Off Ramp" or "Secret Storie". While the songs are well-mixed and balanced, there is no new stuff that is unique or soul-searching. It seems Matheny is just repeating the same riffs off the older albums in a hybrid form. Too many notes, but too little soul or fascinating lyricism like the album "Missouri skies."
__label__2 Matchbox Cement Mixer: I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas who loves all things construction. If you pull the exhaust pipe back it makes your typical construction sounds and has a cement plastic ball that shoots out when the exhaust pipe is pulled down. This item arrived on time with no problems. I would consider this a medium sized play vehicle, larger than matchbox cars but half the size of the bigger standard durable "outside" vehicles my son plays with during the summer.
__label__1 Kind of disappointed....: I have Jeff's previous DVD's - Arguing with Myself and Spark of Insanity - and really like them. Sent them to my parents last year for Christmas, too. This year, I was excited about getting them an actual Christmas special of Jeff D. for the Christmas season. Visited over Thanksgiving and popped it in that evening. Was sad that the content was so often sexual/racy. He's such a funny and talented guy - I don't think he has to go down that road. Maybe it was the venue he was hosting that prompted the material. Who knows, but to do it over - I wouldn't purchase this DVD.
__label__2 Fairly easy and works with one minor problem: Minor problem:Thought the batteries were dead as it wasn't working. Inspecting the battery holder again noticed the two metal tabs on either side could be push in. After pushing them in just a little put the batteries back in and the timer worked. Must not have been making contact until then.Review:First you set the time. Three buttons for that. The forward and back are used to change it.Then you select program 1, 2, 1&2, or off and then edit the on and off times for whichever one you want.Make sure the display shows the program you want to have working and that's pretty much it.If you press on the front cover you can quickly turn what's plugged into the timer outlet on and off at will.Well worth it.Update (7/11/2011) -> It still works and has been working every night since 2007.
__label__1 Disappointing: I think the magazine title is mileading. There's not much science in this magazine. I got two issues so far and there isn't a single article that I found worth reading. The culture is quite evident in the advertisments that are featured which if I my add are quite age inappropriate. They feature advertisments for male organ enlargements, stimulants, aphrodisiacs and include lots of testimonials. I am very uncomfortable letting this sit around as I have an 8 year old. I have to throw this mag away the same day I get it. Stay away if you are really interested in science.
__label__1 Not a good book for one with manic-depression like myself...: A friend told me I just had to read this book... all I have to say is that true friends don't let friends read Wally Lamb. I think the main problem with this book is that you have to hate the main character. Everytime anything really bad happens to Dolores (the MC) she just does something completely evil as a reaction to make you despise her. Liiike... she decides to have a gay encounter with some woman (I believe her name was Dottie). And throughout the book all Dottie talks about is how much she looooves her little fish. Anyhow, after Dolores has her *encounter* she gets up and poisons all of Dottie's fish because she's 'depressed'. Yeah, bite me, you're depressed... so go and kill some defenseless animals. Really, don't read this book if you fight depression yourself and don't read it if you actually expect some good material.
__label__2 Worth a try: I am normally very faithful about using Pampers Swaddlers because they are so absorbent but Swaddlers aren't bigger than size 3 so I thought I would give these a try for when we outgrow the Swaddlers. The Baby Dry was cheaper per diaper than Swaddlers and Cruisers. I am very pleased with the diapers, however, my son does leak through overnight. I don't know if the diaper is totally to blame because he does sleep on his stomach some of the time and he is a super soaker at night! I have been using these diapers for 4 weeks and I have enough diapers left to last another 2-3 weeks! I think I will try Cruisers next to have something else to compare to. We definitely prefer the Pampers brand!!
__label__1 Stereotypical Mexican: I'm not a Spanish expert, but i understood almost all of the words in the movie. When I first saw the movie, I was bored first, then I thought about how they portray the average Mexican. Almost every person in the little community, which I doubt even exists, is an illegal immagrant. One of the main characters even has a mullet. I gave a quick, little chuckle at that notion. Note, putting a LA Dodger hat on a Mexican, DOES NOT MAKE HIM AMERICAN. I would think that if a young aged person would walk out of that movie feeling that every Mexican that lives in the south west, is an illegal immagrant. They also get the immprssion that they reeked of foul odor.
__label__2 DVD is excellent: I always loved this movie but vhs didnt do it justice. This dvd is killer apart from a few artifacts. Sound is great- colours very vivid. Buy it!
__label__1 Airless electric paint spray gun: Awful......save your money....couldn't keep it unclogged long enough to use it. Ended up rolling and brushing our area.
__label__1 Trash: This show is just several hours of trash the set was given to me i told my friend do not waist you money on this trash becouse it belongs in the trash bin.Basketball Wives: Season 3 (3 Disc)
__label__1 Not Reliable: This is a fairly powerful underwater light. It looked really nice in my small water garden. Unfortunately, it lasted only a few weeks. Apparently, it's not made for underwater use. I bought another brand and that one is working out well.
__label__1 Disapointed: Purchase the CD thinking it was a concert in Jamaica. The content is mostly talking and then they have the taping of the talking. Very little music.....
__label__1 Jean Francois Millet- no visuals...What gives? Kindle version: The Kindle version of Jean Francois Millet had no visuals to go along with said described written accounts of each painting within the life of Millet. Sad- but then perhaps it was too much to ask at the time when this was all developed and made into a Kindle product. I did find much history dedicated to some of his famous paintings...and did look at his paintings via the internet while reading information held in this book. I can only see 1 star here- great few lines of history for each painting or visual- but its hard to keep my concentration with this book with no visuals....What gives?
__label__2 Extraordinary album; a must-have: I started my RT collection a few years back like the above reviewer (with a few extra bucks in my pocket, I bought "Rumor and Sigh"). After the first listen, he had me hooked. After that, I picked up you? me? us?, and followed up with "Small Town Romance," which is easily one of the most incredible albums I've ever heard, folk singer or otherwise. I was fortunate enough to see RT recently in concert, and realized how funny the man is--there are a few spots on this album where he cracks the audience up, but it doesn't reflect just how witty he is. If you're a folk fan of any degree, BUY THIS ALBUM. You can't go wrong.
__label__2 Great Product, with a flaw or two: 2013 UPDATE: This product has been discontinued.This product is decent. It provides a nice amount of crunch-dried (a tad different than freeze-dried) fruit with a great taste. While there are mostly apples, the other fruits are represented well enough.The only problem is the fruit dust. Because of the shape of the package, the only way to get fruit out is to tip the pack. Unfortunately, fruit dust always resides at the bottom and easily creates a mess if one is not careful.All in all, I recommend this product and hope that the organic version of this will be chosen over the non-organic. With apples being number two on the foods most contaminated with pesticides, organic is the only option.
__label__1 Trash: I had mine for 2 weeks then the charger quit. They sent me a new charger andthat lasted a few weeks then it quit. Gave up and just threw the thing out.Richard
__label__2 full of interesting snippets that add to your holiday: Excellent book that doesn't only cover the practical stuff but includes fascinating extras: the horrific story of British envoys Connelly and Stoddart in Bukhara; astronomer king Ulug Beg; poetry by Alisher Navoi; a biography of Tamerlane. Also has lots of evocative photos. Found it really useful during my holiday in Uzbekistan (a lovely unspoilt and exotic country- can't recommend it highly enough)
__label__2 Great Value with Amazon's Superb Service: My wife and I have used heating pads for over 40 years and the Conaire is the finest product we have used. It resides on my bed for treating my arthritic back and is large enough to provide warmth for the whole back which is especially useful in the winter.
__label__2 IPOD Classic: THis is my rd IPOD and the best out of all. I first purchased the Ipod mini, big mistake! It did not hold all my songs and had to upgrade to a 20GB. The 20GB stopped functioning after 3 years of continuous use. SO iwas force to buy another and I have to say the Classic has features that my previous did not and I do no how i functioned without it. I download podcasts and TV shows and the clarity is exceptional! High quality! The addition of the coverflow is high tech and a nice added extra of 3 games, which i play constantly while on the subway while simultaneously listening to my music.
__label__1 Too small: This is the largest size but it is still to small. It is suppose to fit my 2012 Camry. It is too wide side to side but too short top to bottom. My visors are barely able to hold the shade from falling from the windshield. I don't know why manufacturers can't seem to make these fit new cars.
__label__1 Overall good but limited: We have this printer and have been impressed overall. One thing to note however--HP has purposively not allowed the user to set printer settings to greyscale in order to try to get you to use the [more expensive] color ink. So if you want to print in black and white, each time you print you have to open up the printer setup and change it to "print in greyscale". What a pain in the neck, I don't think inconveniencing the user should be part of a business model but this appears to be the case with hp...would welcome any advice from anybody who has been able to get around this limitation, hp technical support was unable to help. other than that the printer is pretty good, doesn't jam often.
__label__1 Cheap and Not effective: These leaked all over my table. Did not soak up the glass sweat and cracked from water log. They also stick to your glasses so when you pick them up they fall down on the table with a loud crash.
__label__2 great old songs: i purchest this cd for the songs friday and hoochie mama and the low price thank you.and because i like to have it in my collection and not on a download file.
__label__2 AWESOME: I have actually killed a couple of cd's from this show. Just never grows old.When I'm down I just put this album on!
__label__1 Not good enough: This may work in low drawing things but was not able to keep up with a portable scanner. I had to purchase some that were 2700mAh. They worked well.
__label__2 A little bulkier than the older models it replaces...: A little bulkier than the older models it replaces, but suction is fine, battery life good. Extra step to clear out hepa filter is no big deal.
__label__1 Poorly designed: I just tried this stoller in the store and I have to say I was very disappointed. The concept is great, but they still have some work to do. The seat in back for the older child slides back and forth. Also, there really isnt much room to sit comfortably. My3 year old daughter, who is little and only weighs 26 lbs, didn't have much room. She had to lean forward when she was sitting. I asked her if she liked it and she said no, she wanted out. Also, who wants to sit facing backwards. All she has to look at is me!It really wasn't much better in the standing position either. Even though I know she really might not want to use it that often I would rather pay the same money and get the Graco double stoller. At least then when she wants to sit she can do so comfortably. When I put her in the Graco double stoller, she did not want to get out. She asked me to please take her for a ride around the store.
__label__2 Just great story-line and production: This is perhaps one of my favorite Asian exports. The second session has such strong episodes, outlining things to come and bringing depth to some of the side characters. I think that the best part of a story is giving you things to relate to and these storys are full of that.With plot twists, foreshadowing, and a new character, you can't go wrong. Pick up the fist session and continue with this one. You won't be sorry you did.
__label__1 Terrible reception: I had high hopes for this unit based on the reviews, especially for a trip to Europe and the Pacific I planned.The unit never got a signal in Germany for 3 days. When i arrived in Hawaii, it took forever to acquire a signal, then lost it at underpasses. In Miami and Tampa it took forever to get a signal leaving the airport.The call to take exits comes way too close to the turn. And the display doesn't offer enough detailed info (arrival time, total distance, etc.)Go with Tom Tom
__label__2 Dorthy and Alice: Imagine "The Wizard of Oz" filmed on the settings for "Alice in Wonderland". That should give you a pretty good feel for this story. The original Dorothy makes a short cameo appearance towards the end of this movie. All the other characters you expect are there, but almost unrecognizable. Some of the dialogue is a bit stilted and some improbable-for-no-reason events occur, But the story line is fresh and alive. This movie is well worth its cost and can provide hours of entertainment for the whole family.
__label__2 Get Your 15 Minutes: Andy Warhol is reputed to have said that, "in the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes." If you want to get your 15 minutes of fame--and more--you need to know how to get publicity. Although I've successfully generated publicity in local and national media, I found several great tips in this book that I will use to make my future publicity campaigns even more successful.Beginners especially will find the many sample media releases and other PR documents very useful. Learning how to write press releases and other publicity materials is easier when you have good examples to follow, and 'Guerrilla Publicity' has lots of them. The book is well-organized and easy to read and put to use.Publicity is the best low-cost way to market your business and build your professional reputation. Of course, if you decide you don't want publicity, that's OK--I'll take your 15 minutes!
__label__2 Amazing Set: I purchased this cookware set at a gift, along with a set of Farberware cooking utinciles. I own a similar set of the same brand and have been very pleased with it. So far the recipiant has LOVED them and uses them frequently.
__label__1 Ophiel would not be happy: Opheil's mission was to bring the practice of the occult to the common man. While he was alive his books sold for very little. He would send personal advice to you for a dollar and a stamp. This is a slap in the face to this great man. To sell one of his books, the books are great, if you can get the book for a fair prices do so, for this kind of money is a sin. I hope all the good forces ophiel dealt with punish you the way you should be punished. This man imparted his knowledge at a price that allowed him to live a decent life but allowed everyone to be able to afford his books. I got his books in the 80's for about 10 dollars and they had color drawings in them. I wanted to get some of the ones I missed and then I saw this rip off of a great man's good works.
__label__2 Their Best: Some people may tell you that "White Trash" may be NoFX's best record, but I must disagree. This 1997 release is far superior to the elder, however, "White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean" is still great. This CD is amazing. It's perfect for skating, displaying more ska than NoFX ever have before. It is fast paced, with cool lyrics, thunderous drums, and Fat Mike's classic bass and vocals. I love the hard edged guitars as well. My favorite songs on here are "Monosyllabic Girl", "Kids of the K-Hole", and "It's My Job To Keep Punk Rock Elite". Also check out Anti Flag, Millencolin, and Ten Foot Pole.
__label__1 Not my cup of tea: I couldn't finish this film, found it so boring it got to my nerves. It's about a drug dealer in New York trying to come to terms with his jail sentence. Lots of guilt, sorry, melancholy - very little entertainment. I must admit I find nothing interesting in a New York drug dealer as a movie subject - in fact I find nothing interesting in big city life or drug dealers, respectively. So the drama goes out the window with that. And there's nothing left really to keep you entertained.I don't wanna bag the people who like this film, each to their own. Just wanted to express my own disappointment. It may even have been good, cos I stopped watching before halfway, there was nothing in it for me.
__label__2 TI-Nspire CAS Graphing Calculator (Purchased on March 14, 2012): Thanks for arrived on timethe calculator was awesome which was brand new and saved me a fair bit of money
__label__1 Save your money: This book is not well organized. Save your money and the information is not up-to-dated.
__label__2 Cute and quite: I bought this (pink pig) three years ago and never used it much. The first time I used it it leaks but not now. I guess I wasn't using it correctly back then. It is pretty quite, with a little bit water dripping noise (quite/natural enough to be ignored). For your information, I in general cannot tolerate much of the noise while sleeping. I can hear notebook HD noise, static noise from speakers if not powered off ect. But this one doesn't annoy me at all.Overall, I like it. Plan to buy another one.
__label__1 Major league disappointment: My eight year old daughter and I approached this book with such eagerness, as we both love baseball and magic. On page 115 we made the mutual decision to give up. Michael Chabon is a talented writer for adults but he has no clue how to structure a story for young minds. Characters are fuzzy, the plot is hard to follow, and there's a lot of overwriting. (We kept saying, "Who is he again? Who are the bad guys again? What do they want?" and paging back to find out. By page 115 we still weren't clear, and ceased to care.) The more I read other writers of fiction for young people, the more I appreciate J.K Rowling.
__label__2 Good movie!: Explosive! Action packed, Nicolas Cage is one of those actors that makes you cry for a bad movie and the comes back with a great one. This was neither of them, but still good.
__label__2 Amazing First hand account: This book was an amazing look into the actual real life experience of being a Tank Platoon leader in WWII and really puts your mind right into the events unfolding. The Author has great knowledge and understanding of the roll and duty of a soldier. A must for any WWII reader.
__label__1 wishing we had bought something else: This tricycle was a lot of fun during the phase where we pushed my daughter around on it, but now that she is trying to pedal herself.....she tips over ALL the time. If she just leans over to look at something...it tips. Or if she turns the steering...it tips. She is sooo frustrated that she can't ride it. I didn't realize just how bad this trike was, until she hopped right on my nephew's bike and took off like a pro...never tipping over! All this time , it has been her trike and not her lack of control. It appears to us that there is a poor center of gravity based on the design of the bike. We are currently shopping for something else.
__label__1 Obnoxious Cover: The cover of this book is very, very obnoxious to me. Maybe it is meant to be funny? But for me it's silly, petty, and a complete joke..Not to be taken seriously..Instead, for mental toughness, I went ahead and bought a couple of Self Discipline/Mental Toughness books from Ex-NAVY Seal members. At least I know they have had some tough experiences.This kindergarten school master image on the cover of this book, must change if I am to buy any Daniel Teitelbaum books.
__label__1 boring, boring, boring: i thought this book would tell an exciting story based on the classic fairytale "cinderella". it did tell a tale but it was soo very slow that i couldn't wait for it to end so i could read something else. maguire does develop the characters and story that precede the magnificent ball in the classic tale. what he fails to do is make you give a damn about any of the characters so the story makes little or no positive impression on you. i was bored from the get go and only finished it because it was a book club book. don't think i have the gumption to read "wicked" despite the positive reviews i've read on amazon.com.
__label__1 Waterproof? Nope: Well, after one day of getting water on my Garmin... it stopped working. Everything was sealed and locked up tight, but it got mosture inside the screen and stopped working >:[
__label__1 looks beautiful..........performance questionable: It is a beautiful unit...................looks good sitting on the table. Easy to set time of day and times you want a light or appliance to start and stop. Problem is that the batteries (takes 2 button size which were priced at $6.99 each at Batteries Plus) seem to run out withina year or so and the cost of a new unit vs. new batteries is pretty much the same!
__label__2 Ladies of Garage! Meet- Aleesha, Sabrina and Su-Elise.: This album shows typical English garage! Which is a mixture of dance and R'n'B! It is a brilliant "getting ready for a party" album! With guest apperances from Asher D and Harvey from The So Solid crew- Another Garage crew! It is soft garage with nice mc's from Aleesha.I'd recommend DEFINATELY!!I do like a lot of R'n'B and this slbum is garage coming into its R'n'B and hip-hop form.
__label__1 Absolute Trash: A complete waste of brain matter -- you are destroying all cells with this trash, poor plot, compounded by the worst acting ever put on the screen - embarrassing! Stay away -- as far as possible!
__label__2 Still the best stuff out there: This is a go-to for me. Every time I tried using something else my skin would react in a way that I didn't want it to, but this stuff always works for me. Just a good product to keep your skin balanced, it's also good for traveling because you can use it in place of soap or shaving cream. I never use soaps on my face anymore, in fact I just stick to Cetaphil during the day, a day moisturizer, and Ponds Cold cream at night. My skin has improved dramaticallyThe only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of the price, though most stores carry a generic version. Either way it's still the best.
__label__1 No secret here: A friend recommended this book, said it got her through a rough time in her life. I got the book, it was pathetic. Basically, the book says (and repeats ad nauseum) that if you want something, no matter what it is, wish really hard and believe it will come to you, and it will. It doesn't get more childish and ridiculous than this. "The Secret" was the secret to wealth for its author; otherwise, it's a waste of trees and whatever else went into the production of it.
__label__2 Great Set: Definitely a good purchase. I bought this set about 4 months ago and they have been perfect! They still look brand new. Yes they are heavy, but that's a plus, they are thick and distribute heat very well.Eggs cook well on the non-stick.The strainer is awesome to steam artichokes in the large pot.The saucer is perfect for even cooking veggies you would cook in a wok.This is a very versatile set.
__label__1 BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: From all the reviews I have read concerning this release it does'nt even deserve 1 star. I'm not talking about the cartoons , the cartoons themselves are all classic,I'm talking about the HORRIBLE transfers and the fact that they DID NOT include the opening and closing themes. I would buy this but the price would have to come down a lot because this is not a quality effort put into the release of this product. If there is not a re-release then I guess I will be stuck with this unacceptable version of this release , but first the price must come down.
__label__1 Broiler doesn't work: However, I paid only $19.95 for it and only use for toasting french bread. Other than that, it's not worth more than what I paid.
__label__1 Don't Buy Netgear WNR854T: My Netgear WNR854T worked extremely well for 10 months and then just died all of sudden. If I had read all those reviews, I would not have bought this router in the first place. Hope this review helps you make the right decision!!
__label__1 Useless: You are better off buying your kid a pair of scissors. This toy requires the user to move the cutter VERY, VERY slowly to get it to cut through the paper or foam. It's not very accurate, doesn't do a great job cutting, and requires D batteries. Waste of money.
__label__2 Awesome bass, will get anyones attention: Any intersection that I play this album Everybody notice's the beat rather than shrug it off as noise pollution. The womenz all like the crazy mixin and rollin waves of bass off the subs. It's like a pulse that just sucks the oxygen out of your lungs. Buy this album for the warp bros cause those are the good songs. Bass in this album is better than any rap album. If you've got a couple of 10"s or 12"s, some good component speakers, you'll witness what truly is PHAT BASS
__label__2 The best of the best: My favorite album ever. The only album I know of that I wouldn't change a single thing. Perfect in every way.
__label__2 Love John Williams? You'll like this...: This is an excellent CD. Even though not composed by Williams, it has the same sort of feel as the score for Jurassic Park. I found this CD to be superior to the Lost World movie soundtrack in every way. Don't take my advice though, just listen to the clips listed above and see for yourself :)
__label__2 The ultra- orthodox view of the modern state of Israel: I read this work in the original in Hebrew. I was impressed by the depth of Ravitzky's knowledge of the ultra- orthodox world, and learned much about Haredi resistance to Zionism , a subject that had always perplexted me. And this because I praying daily the verse 'And return our eyes to Zion with mercy' always assumed that somehow to be religious meant to support a modern Jewish state in the land of Israel.As I know Ravitzky's political position and bias ( He is a left- of center religious Zionist, ) I have a certain reserve about his writing about Habad , who are in the other camp completely.But this is certainly a work worth reading, and even studying if one wishes to understand the variety of religious positions on the redemptive character and nature of the modern state of Israel.
__label__2 fantastic: The Tudor DVDs fromShowtime are beautiful to watch. Most of rhe history is correct. Henry VIII is portrayed so well as being rather nice when young and then getting really mean and cruel. Always interesting to watch.
__label__1 Horrendous: I've used hundreds of software programs over the years, and this application ranks among the three worst (I'd venture to say it is the worst). I have attempted to use this produce for approximately 2 years now. Despite episodes of successful utilization, the program has consistently given me problems at pretty much every step, from downloading and installing the program to establishing contact with my phone and executing synchronization. Unfortunately, it is one of the few products that sychronizes cell phone calendars with Outlook's calendar. Nonetheless, I decided I was fed up with this product, and installed a different synchronization application, which has posed no problems thus far (though it does not synchronization my Outlook calendar with my phone's calendar). Considering I have a Pocket PC, this is a small price to pay for the reduced hassle.
__label__2 Cool! Easy Kaleidoscopes!: I have already had WAY too much fun with this book! I have had to order several more pieces of fabric (like I need more) because I am intrigued with the results I obtain using Bethany's techniques. I have found this book to be surprisingly easy to follow; the instructions are well thought out and very well illustrated. I also thought that the addition of instructions on how to organize a workshop using this technique were great! My only problem is that I can't seem to stop Stacking and Whacking!
__label__1 Style over substance: As a former fraternity member, this did nothing to capture the essence of fraternity life, or hazing for that matter. Also, the writer tried so hard to have a distinct writing style that it interfered with the storytelling.
__label__2 2 originals of Glenn Hughes is all original.....Rock n Roll...: Glenn Hughes vocalist/bassist for Deep Purple/Trapeze & many otherbands is also a solo artist that is pretty much ignored in the states.Thanks heavens for Japan & other countries who still know a brillianttalent & keeps Hughes making music. These 2 solo efforts are superiorthan what critics & radio [Springsteen & Joel] called great these days.The way it is/building the machine have rock, funk, slow, blues & evenmodern rock songs! Try songs like the curse, the way it is, too far gone,second son, Can't stop the flood, I will follow you & the haunting bigsky & you will hear the awesome singing, playing & writing of this rocklegend. If you heard of some of his material or just looking for somegreat classsic songwriting this is the man to deliver! The Voice of Rock!
__label__1 This is some lame ass SHI*T: i bought this cd hoping it would be something heavy. this is a gay band and they suck ass becauseall the musicians lack talent in so many areas. not to mention the vocalist, who by the way, is a woman. (if you want to call her that, i think she is as ugly as the music itself)Her voice lacks charisma and is horrid and opaque. she should burn in heck for being so ugly and for having that voice. O GOD IM GETTING SICK JUST THINKING ABOUT HER!!!! IM GONNA KILL MYSELF-BANG
__label__1 WAY TOO SMALL!: My child is in the 40th percentil for weight and height, but I still couldn't squeeze him into it. It was long enough but way too narrow. I'm not sure who designed this outfit, but it's a horrible fit. Don't waste your money. It looks cute but the hat is huge. My two year old put the hat on and it was still a little big for him. Save your money and buy something else. You'll be disappointed.
__label__1 2 or under: I bought this for my toddler. He was able to use it for less than 1 month. He grew out of it.The velcro strap on the bottom is much too short. It is also very hard to remove after the childis done swimming.I had to deflate the whole tube,to get him out,ending his day of swimming.It's a good idea, but is not for kids over 2.I think it could be made better.
__label__2 This is pretty good.: This was one of the first albums I have ever gotten from GBH. It did show me on how the band has somewhat evolved. I really liked Damn Good Time, Enzo, Tokyo after Dark. This was rarest of GBH's recordings (We bite records hasn't let this album live very long so I'm sure the original will become a collecter's item). Get this as one of your first CDs from them (if you get more than one) becauseit will show you that the band changed a little.
__label__1 Sorry to differ from the reader below.: This book is little or no use unless you have a very strong background infield theoretical methods. If you are a seasoned pro. you might find ituseful but if you want to teach yourself.... you will soon get frustrated.Still my hat's off to the authors who pioneered the area.Conclusion: if you are a PhD student, get Fetter & Walecka instead.
__label__2 Great: Perfect reboot and more true to the comics. Surprisingly funny, and lots of action. Liked it more than the original and was less theatrical.
__label__2 owned it for over 5 years: at first it did blow several times all covered except the last one under warranty. I noticed after so long the ground cable was corroded all the way through, I ran a separate ground wire to the battery, no problems after that. I have a Pyle 12 farad cap, and it pushing a 15" lanzar heritage 2400 watt. at a 1/4 level with bass boost on and the Sub Sonic Filter off, pounds damn hard, (in a 99 Pontiac grand Prix) the trunk spoiler threads are striped it shook it so hard. its in a custom box i built, ported, I'd say at least a 4.5 cu/ft. I shake windows in buildings, one hell of a back massage LOL. 1 thing people need to realize, match your amp with your sub! 3000 watt @ 1 ohm! so if ur pushing a 6 ohm sub, its 6x less power...is about as basic as it gets(not the exact math but close enough) and the MAJORITY is your speaker box, I solely believe in ported, except in pickup trucks, weak speakers go in bandpass!

__label__2 Love!: I love this heating pad. It's the first one I have ever purchased and I think that everyone should have one! Thanks!
__label__2 Great game. Great condition.: This game is a smart purchase, because it has a lot of multiplayer content and is as enjoyable playing it the third time as the first. The game was also in great condition with its original case and artwork. All in all a great deal.
__label__2 Great Book for Powerful Bible Studies: G. Steven Kinnard's book offers Christians insights into how to deepen your understanding and study of the Word of God. Kinnard offers practical application points as well as insights into the struture, themes, and outlines of the books of the Bible.For those who love the Bible and long to grow in your knowledge of Jesus and His Kingdom (2 Peter 3:18) then I would urge you to purchase this book and go deeper into the Bible than you have ever been before (John 17:17).
__label__2 great gift: I bought this for my girlfriend for a birthday present and what a hit. Everyone at the bash loved it. It is great to play w/ friends who know how to have a good time.
__label__2 Another Great One: I get a charge out of this album. After the departure of the great Sandy Denny, Fairport continued their concentration on British roots music. Even the original numbers here sound like traditional tunes. The band displays a somewhat more muscular approach; the instrumental rave-ups are particularly compelling. Although the band was left without a strong vocalist at this point, the harmonies are very well done, and Dave Swarbrick, handling most of the lead vocals, does a fine job.
__label__2 A clever spy thriller: Tom Cruise stars as Ethan Hunt, a member of an elite espionage team headed by Jim Phelps(Jon Voight). What was thought to be a routine survellance assignment goes all wrong and leaves Ethan framed for the death of his team. Desperate to uncover the truth and find the mole he goes on the run. But will Ethan want to believe the truth when he discovers it?This is a clever movie that has it all, plenty of suspence action and a great plot. This is by far superior to the sequel. The director Brian De Palma is a genious and shows it with breathtaking shot after shot. The supporting cast is perfect including Jean Reno and Ving Rhames. This is a movie I can watch over and over. I highly recommended. The film is presented in wide and full screen, DD 5.1 and has a theatrical trailer.
__label__2 best part of my home theater: I had a subwoofer from NHT in place in my home theater and was always disatisfied. I finally replaced it with this Polk W505 because I had liked an older model for a long time. After several months of use I still find myself saying wow. This unit has integrated/blended well with the rest of the surround system in my home theater.It's only shortcoming is that I need to manually shut it down every time I turn off the receiver.
__label__2 BEST MOVIE EVER: This is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. The acting is great!The best actor in this movie is the character Fizzy.
__label__1 READ THE REVIEWS CAREFULLY-A LOT OF VIOLENCE: Low quality, too violent, not worth the $10 - I would return it if I could. The idea is good: we should not ravage the environment, we should respect nature and each other. Unfortunately, the message is delivered through "an eye for an eye" method: the wronged native american severely and violently tortures the callous white american to demonstrate how nature is tortured. The net result: I could have skipped (and did, after the violence started) viewing the movie, and would have been better off.
__label__1 Discouraging sound quality mutes strong performances: With Domingo and Arroyo taking the leading roles, and Abbado conducting, you'd have every right to expect an engaging performance. But the sound quality is so low that the performers are difficult to enjoy. The vocalists sound as though they are singing through several layers of waxed paper, while the orchestra seems to be phoning it in over a cheap handset. Overall, the sound quality approximates that of an early transistor radio. What a shame, since, no doubt, the actual performances were quite wonderful.
__label__1 Disappointing: I love his books, they usually are very complex. This book was a short story with a very shallow plot. Did he have to get a book out for Christmas?
__label__2 loved it: fabulous it was the best present for my uncle for christmas because it was exactly what he wanted woo hoo
__label__1 snooze: Kreidler's Appearance And The Park album really had a great feeling with it's warm touch to the electronic soundcapes. but with this album, there seems to be more emphasis on a colder, more sterile atmosphere. these pieces seem rather detached and it doesn't work when they try to break out of that detachment and try their hand at acting quirky. it just sounds kinda embarrassing and frankly, boring. the inclusion of Momus on the second track is one of those main embarrasments. Leo Garcia's vocal contribution towards the end of the album work a little bit better, but the music sounds like warmed over leftovers. overall, this record just farts around and doesn't go anywhere. seek out Kreidler's first two records or their amazing Eve Future mini ep before attempting to digest this tepid excursion into tired and fruitless territory.
__label__2 janetb: I have not had much time to use my Suzanne Somers Toning System but just the short time I have used it, I can tell a difference in muscle tone. The system looks like it would not be very beneficial but it really works. My 11 year old daughter has also been using it and she said it's alot harder than it looks.
__label__2 Great for the price: Good quality replacement cap, its well built, have put around 1000 miles on the car since installing it. Plus it was cheaper buying it here then in my local car parts places.
__label__1 Ehhh: Very slow...it took forever to build the story but then I felt like it ended in the middle of the book...not the end. I felt very let down.
__label__2 Great Book!: Great book for people that need to write email. It would be nice to review the grammar rule's from time to time.
__label__2 Im a 12 year old kid and I know unix because of this book.: I think this book is right on the money. It is easy to use and friendly to the beginer like my self. It lays everything out very nicely. I recomed this book for all ages.
__label__2 Good Buy: I really only used the book one week before the test. Some of the concepts were hard to understand the way the book explained them, but it prepared me very well. Although I have not gotten my scores in yet, I think I did fairly well and I owe it to this book and my Chemistry teacher
__label__2 wonderful: So much of what he says really works. I have had to go back and re-read parts because it is something I have never heard before. I and 2 of my kids are wheat (gluten) sensitive. We eat a whole bunch of brown rice because of that. Well I eat real healthful and still am 50 pounds over weight and I have problems with allergies and sinus issues. I have started the diet and am losing weight and my sinuses and allergies are getting better. I would highly recommend this book.
__label__1 A tiny stone: I'm very dissapointed, photo is absolutely different of the product that I received or at least I was waiting for.Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Awesome: I love this book. Koodsma describes a brilliant, unique method and approach to teaching oneself the art and science of recognizing bird calls and songs while also delivering a very absorbing read. Koodsma is a gifted story teller. The book is built out from beautifully detailed field work diaries, rich with the emotion of discovery and an infectious appreciation for the unique character and "song" for each individual bird he's tracked and grown to know as if they were kin.
__label__1 This pad sucks: Alright, well I've been playing ddr for about 9 months now, I play on heavy and I used to have 2 of these mats, or something similar. These mats work good if you are a begginer and play on begginer or light. If you play on standard or heavy these mats suck. they slide everywhere and bunch up, and after a while the sensors get bad. I have mats with foam inside them, they work just as great and cost 30-40 bucks at toys r us, im tryin to get metal mats but they are really expensive.
__label__1 buyer beware: what they don't show or tell you is that while the outside of the door lock is a beautiful finish the inside is a large white colored plastic box! I do not want to look at a white plastic box on the inside of my beautiful (and quite expensive) front door.
__label__2 Read remind me of The Help: I really enjoyed this one. I couldnt put it down to find out how the summer ended. Sissy dont take no mess from NO ONE.... way to live your life by YOUR rules !!
__label__1 Was going to buy... not now: To be brief, I was looking forward to buying this game until I heard about the draconian (nay Dickensian) DRM and the technical problems associated with the game (some of which are probably a direct result of EA not being prepared to handle everybody trying to register their games at the same time). Better pissed off than pissed on, so I would say to EA: stop pissing on your customers.
__label__1 Nice eye candy, but movie itself is lacking.: This Blu-ray Disc has excellent picture and sound. However, I found the movie itself to be lacking. First of all, the content of this movie could have been narrated in 15 minutes; as a result, the movie seems to repeat the same concept over and over again therefore being very predictable in where it is going.Second of all, the movie was very obviously designed to be watched in 3-D. The effect is just not the same in 2-D as fish swim towards the screen in 2-D and objects awkwardly jut towards the camera. While I'm sure this movie was engaging in 3-D, watching at home in 2-D was actually rather boring and non-engaging.I've thoroughly enjoyed other National Geographic presentations on Blu-ray such as Relentless Enemies, however this one seems to be short on substance and designed for color 3-D delivery which is not really possible on Blu-ray yet. I'd avoid this despite its interesting sounding title.
__label__1 small book: This book was a disapointment. Very small with 36 pages of art work mostly from the turn of the century. Most of the mermaids were very anemic looking with overly sexual poses. Good quality paper in book, but pictures just too small. I bought this for inspiration for my art, it was not. I was looking for a book of gorgeous art work with mythical creatures from the sea.
__label__1 Have not been able to put it to work with Windows 7 32-bit: Hello,I bought two of these, one of them works fine under Windows XP (although the remote only allows to switch from full screen to windows screen and you can only change channels by using the numeric pad..you cannot move backward or forward..) I tried to put the other one to work with my laptop that was running Windows 7-64 bit Professional, but, although I contact the vendor's customer support by email, the options that they gave me didn't work.So, I decided to try with another laptop that I have with Windows 7-32 bit, but the device cannot work with the drivers provided..not even with the ones that can be downloaded from the vendor's site nor the ones that customer support sent me by e-mail.Unfortunately, I have not been able to enjoy this product under Windows 7 and I have the product stored on my closet meanwhile.Thanks,Allan.
__label__1 Typical "B" grade horror flick: I purchased this video just to see Colleen Camp and Sondra Locke before they got famous. The movie was a bit over the top and alot of unnecessary mayhem.
__label__1 If this is Heaven, I'm not going.: I thought I would read this before purchasing Mitch Albom's more recent Time Keeper just to have some exposure to the author's writing. In a way, I'm glad I did. I have not read a more depressing story since Old Yeller, and that was a substantial number of books ago. While I get the comparison's to It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol (and no, the book does not have anything to do with Christmas), this is a sad story about a sad man who lived a sad life. The fact that the people he meets in Heaven can help explain why, does not make it any less sad. I think I'll skip Time Keeper.
__label__1 The Ending SUCKED!!!: I was very hopeful, and even enjoying the interaction of the two main characters, but the ending was just out of the blue and very stupid. I won't spoil it, but the ending was stupid on the level of the the famous season of tv soap opera "Dallas" that was written off as a dream. From the murder on, it was all pointless, and had little to do with the beginning.
__label__2 Great fun, great workout: It took a while to learn the moves -- this is definitely the most choreographed exercise video I've done. After two or three shots at it, it started falling into place. The moves are funky and pretty demanding when they've built to a full routine, and Abdul is really professional and smooth in her delivery. Her dancers were also very good. They could even follow her directions, which were totally useless. She'd say we're doing a step left, step right and it would turn out to be a complex combination of steps, turns, dips, arm movements, you name it. But the workout is fun and before you know it you're doing the toning exercises and cooling down. It's one of my favorites now.
__label__1 Incredulous: Ken Timmerman wrote this book after reading Ms. Barbara Reynolds's book (search for "On March 12, 2002, Rob Redding interviewed Barbara Reynolds"), "Jesse Jackson: The Man, The Movement, and The Myth." So I'm very incredulous about this man's motivation and source material. Moreover, he has a degree in creative writing so I would not be surprised if his book is nothing but a creative derivation of Ms. Reynolds's book. Nevertheless, I refuse to buy it. However, I will read it if I'm able to obtain it for free (e.g. library).
__label__1 Ayn Rand - The Fountainhead: Great book - $21 is wrong... I purchased the kindle so I could get books around $9... I'll read the 'real' book instead of downloading this off Amazon...
__label__1 You might like the movie better: I enjoyed the movie when I was a child, all the colorful characters, however when I see it in print it looks pretty rediculous.
__label__2 not as good as zep but still awsome: This CD is very heavy on the drums but the vocals are lacking much, because he dosn't compare to Robert Plant. Guitarist isn't bad, niether is the bassist, but jason bonham is the best drummer alive! It is one of the better Led Zeppelin tributes that I have heard.
__label__2 Fantastic little gizmo!!: Truly one of those little things that work as advertised and work well! In the desert, we use "coolers" and this gizmo keeps the temperature perfectly comfortable in the back office. The one for cold weather works well in my brother's greenhouse and the hot one for turning on the ventilation fan.
__label__2 truth or fiction?: Regardless of the recent disclosure of part fictional text......Oprah was right that this is a page turner and a must read. It is about addiction .....who can't learn something more about that?
__label__1 Had two- both broke.: This printer is terrible! The first one I bought showed an error message that was not only incorrect (it said there was a missing ink cartridge when all were properly installed) but could not be cleared. Canon had me send it to them and in return they sent me a refurbished unit. The refurbished unit does not scan properly. The scanner gets "stuck" after about 2/3 of the page and the unit must be turned off and turned back on to resume printing. The result is a copy (or scan) that is muddled and blurry on one side.The really terrible thing about the "new" unit is the noise it makes when the cartridges return to the original position after printing. It sound like the buzzing of a child's wind-up toy, only 100 times louder, and lasts 15 seconds. I cannot make a phone call or carry on a conversation while printing for this reason.The only good point: it did print well for about a week before breaking!
__label__1 Had a lot of potential: I was really excited about this cd until I heard it. She sold me on it when she gave an interview on a local radio station. The snipets I heard were great. It wasn't until I bought it that the tone deaf folks singing made this a flop for me. Too bad because this is the first cd of hers I ever bought. The best song is "In Love at Christmas". that's the only one I can really get into. Perhaps it was the professional singers in the background-hmm. Sorry Kelly-maybe next year.
__label__1 i didn't really like: i didn't really like because it was to old for me so i gave it to some that wouldenjoy it more
__label__1 Um, okay....: I wanted to ask what this person is trying to pull. I received a copy of the original, not the actual. Sorry, guys, but if you are not going to send the real CD, why bother?
__label__2 Silverstein's creative style is funny and fun for kids: This book, written by Shel Silverstien, is a creative book of poetry and fun that will allow for children of all ages to let their imaginations run free. His great use of words are used in a fun way for laughter and entertainment. Silverstein shows off his wonderful talent in writing this excellent poetry/art book. Wonderfully funny illustrations included. I recommend it!
__label__1 Good stick, but parts wear out very quickly: Written as William's Son:Performance wise, this pogo stick works quite well, jumping to heights of about 3 - 4 feet. However, the pogo stick has some major problems:1. It makes much more noise than most people admit. It's loud.2.This is the major one. The thrusters on mine began to wear out in LESS THAN A MONTH. That's a month of 2 weeks frequent jumping and 2 weeks of unuse. THat's a problem. Another is the shock absorbers. They came out following the 2 weeks of unuse.The pogo stick worked well... until the parts started flying. Two point five stars.
__label__2 The Dive From Clausen's Pier: Look away for an instant and your life could change drastically. While going through the motions of life Carrie Bell has no idea what she wants or how to get what she wants. Twenty three and engaged to her high school sweetheart, never leaving her hometown and abandoned by her father.One day her life all changes when her fiance dives from the pier into the water becomes a quad.

When her best friend calls with a tradegy Carrie realizes she has to go back and make amends.This is a book of relationships that teaches you in an instant your life will change sometime for the better or worse. Look away for an instant and see what your life becomes.
__label__1 scam: this is a copy of the real book. don't buy it. no publishing info, no page numbers. find the real thing. really disappointing to receive.
__label__2 The best yet.: All of Ted Loder's books of prayers are almost breathtaking to read. The honesty, the clarity of thought,the freshness of language are the hallmarks of his writing. On this volume he goes over the top. The following example from a prayer entitled "Is This What It Means to Be Free?" will serve to intrigue: "Why is the marvel of a molecule of DNA its capacity to blunder into something new when we would have made it perfect, according to our Eden complex, except the molecules blundered their way into us first---or was that your "sort of" plan all the time, the blundering being a nudge toward an intentional choosing through the whole twisting way?"Imagine talking to God in such an honest and compelling way. Loder's God is one I want to know and share with others, for this God cares about EVERYTHING about us, receives our frustrations and meets us in the most extraordinary ways.A wonderful book. Thank you Rev. Loder...again!
__label__2 TOOT-TOOT: Put this horn on my 1983 Harley FLHTC (SHOVELHEAD).....Would normally fit directly in the horn cover FOR LATER BIKES...MAYBE 1985 ON?...BUT I have an older model, and one of those quirky years to boot,oil bath enclosed chain,rubber mounted/5 speed,weird exhaust...and it would not take the cover....Fortunately the simple black horn fit the mounting perfect and looks just fine just plain and black.After all............."CHROME DON'T GET YOU HOME!"Horn has the LOW tone like the original HD oem horn.I like it. Works great.Sounds cool,like a horn should....No BEEP-BEEP roadrunner sound here.
__label__2 I really enjoyed this album: I picked this album up a few weeks ago and I was pleasantly surprised that I like this album. It's converted me from a Deerhoof doubter to fan.This album isn't for everyone...but it's for me. Child-like, sweet and infectious. The album's worth a buy, if just for the extraordinarily cute, adorable song +81. Believe E.S.P. is another gem. Deerhoof's album is like recorded Dadaism (or an abstract experimental painting). Yeah, I said before when reviewing Apple O that they reminded me of Blonde Redhead. But now, in a good, fresh way).
__label__2 Good quick reference: A good quick reference book, but I will say that some words are not listed. It is focused for 2nd - 5th grade in my opinion. A handy addition for a home reference library!
__label__2 Dreamlife review: Dreamlife is the story of Kacie, her family and her uncle Evan, whose vendetta against "fixing" in boxing establishes the tension in the book. The tale opens with Kacie, a high-school aged woman, performing stunts for a movie production in Hollywood. Soon she's back home in San Antonio, Texas where her life spirals out-of-control as her uncle moves against figures involved in fixing fights in professional boxing.The plot moves at an even pace, spiced with the myriad of colorful details that the many-faceted author garners from his eclectic life. Different aspects of Dreamlife include martial arts, esoteric flower information, snowboarding/skiing and the enterprise of dealling in latin-american antiques, as well as boxing, movie stunt-performing, the literature of Joyce Carol Oates and the cuisine of Korea. Indeed, there is something for everyone.
__label__2 Couldn't get it anywhere else.: Love the song "Sometimes" after I saw it in the movie "Spiral" (pretty good movie too). I like this whole album it is pretty chill. I haven't gotten into Alex Lloyd's newer stuff but I love this album!
__label__1 sappy and not credible: I really hate stories that hook the part of me that cries over sentimental muck. Which is exactly what this novel did.There are little descriptive gems throughout Berg's writing (an extra star for that) but the characters in this story were mostly cliches--one-dimensional and an insult to intelligent readers.
__label__2 Can't beat Quicksilver when it comes to GREATS of the 60's: Saw these guys in Marin County CA many years ago. Found this INCREDIBLE collection at Armadillo Records in Davis and WOW. Best compilation of their music EVER. Hey, one of the best compilations of any music collection!!But Quicksilver was one of the GREAT bands of the 60's & 70's bar none! Combining Jazz, Blues, and just plain innovative music styles. A very unique band. The keyboards, drums [powerful rhythms] and Dino's voice, tell ya, the 60's live in these guys.Sad to say, the music of today just doesn't have it. No comparison. Guess I'll have to live in the past to appreciate GREAT music.Love these guys!!!
__label__1 Another hatchet job from the far right: Hillary Clinton is a smart woman and Noonan doesn't like her. So what? If Noonan is anything like the Ronald Reagan speeches, she's living in her righteous right WASPy wonderland. Good luck.
__label__1 does not recieve channels 2-13: a call to customer service was worthless, I was told that I wouldn't be able to get any channels, I told them that I'm getting over 50 UHF stations, but not one VHF. They called me a liar and insisted that there was nothing wrong with the box. It is junk and the company's customer service is horrible. I don't reccomend dealing with this manufacurer at all.
__label__2 WOW WOW WOW: Gordon Lightfoot is one of the worlds seven wonders. I love his music and to hear his early music and today's music just thrills me to death. He can set you crying, laughing, and smiling. He has a very pleasant voice to listen to and he himself is a very gracious man. Love all his music.
__label__1 Case didn't fit properly: The Canon semi-hard case is big around the lens area for my Canon EOS Digital Rebel XTi camera. I feel the case needs to fit better all around since it is made for Rebel XTi. I am disappointed.
__label__1 Do the job, but poor quality: The title pretty much sums it up. Nice and round, but so flimsy. The weight of the metal is like aluminum foil that has been triple folded. I'd prefer something with enough weight to cut through a raisin for example, when cutting cookies or biscuits.
__label__2 the gift that keeps on giving: this was a gift for my mother-in-law. she had used it all the time and loved it very much but gave it away so that her brother could enjoy cooking in his new home. she has missed her cook book for about 20 years, i got her a new one and a smile was instantly put on her face from ear to ear.betty is always a great cook and she makes you look like you are one too.
__label__1 Illustrated Stand Magazine Sherlock Holmes: The book I received was not the book I ordered.I ordered the book with the facsimile printing of the original Illustrated Strand Magazine articles complete with illustrations. The book I received did not have any illustrations.
__label__2 Most Haunting Visual: The graphic representation of Joan's consummation in the flames is astonishing, even by todays standards. I can't imagine how it got past the censors in 1928. A haunting visual that you'll never forget.
__label__2 "HYDGG" eximplifies what a true "Complete" album should be: What can I say about this album? It is probably the most beautifully composed album I have ever heard. 13 of the 14 tracks on this cd are just awesome songs. The only one I really don't like is Track 1, that french title song. But other than that, just a standout album from what I think is the most underrated band in the music business. Give this album a chance. The standout tracks are "At the Stars", "Allison Foley", "Live Again", "I like it Like That", and "under you". But like I said, 13 of the 14 tracks on this album are amazing. In my opinion this is the best of the 3 albums they have released. Hands down. Granted, Friction Baby had some really powerful songs, but this album cooks.
__label__1 Write errors: The first three did not finish writing on my external Plextor. I returned the remainder for credit
__label__1 Not worth the time: This book is not worth the time or expense. A top trauma surgeon suddenly discovers she can heal with her hands... She runs to hide her "secret". I am really tired of the "small, petite woman" and "tall, Goliath of a man" use also... So, this is the story of a supposedly intelligent woman who runs.... I feel bad even leaving a review because I couldn't finish the book but felt I needed to warn future shoppers.
__label__1 Boring: After the second day of playing this game, i never played it again. All you do is go around picking up people and dropping them off at places. Another thing about it is i Don't like typing in passwords, so that was a negitive.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: I loved watching this show on Animal Planet and figured she had to be legitimate since I like Animal Planet.I had a problem with two of my female dogs fighting. I mean these were terrible attacks that required stitches and vet care. I really didn't want to rehome one of my dogs and thought perhaps Sonya could help me. Well the first thing she said was that my dogs loved each other. What a joke. One was really trying to kill the other one.I paid $300 for something like 20 minutes, maybe 30, but I was totally ripped off.Animal Planet AND Sonya should be ashamed of themselves.
__label__2 Raw and Real: This is the second book I've read by Pastor Mark Driscoll. I listen to his podcasts as well.Though agreeing with him in all points might get me kicked out of my denomiation, I find that many things about what he says need to be said.I'm in a denominational church that looks to the past and seeks to engage the culture thru means of the social gospel. That's then. We live in the now.Pastor Mark talks about engaging the current culture, and his stories about how Mars Hill grew demonstrate what can happen when one gets serious about engaging the culture and contextualizing the gospel, and being unambigously clear about what is believed.I found it a such a humorous and raw read that perhaps i was waking the neighbors laughing so hard.
__label__1 A very disapointing book: The best part of the book is the last four pages that (hopefully) lead into the upcoming Star Wars movie. The interactions between Obi Wan, Anakin, and other Jedi are interesting, but they really don't add any new information. The book really lacks for a good strong plot, an unusual problem for Star Wars books. The book is incredibly predictable, and you know what is going to happen long before it happens.Personally I would recommend this book only to die hard Star Wars fans. If your looking for suspense and action try the New Jedi Order books.
__label__1 DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !: Someone stated in an earlier review that the Cymande 'Bra' version (mix) for the bathroom scene was is on a DJ mix CD called "Danny Krivit - Edits by Mr. K, The Original Rare Disco Mixes." DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID. THAT IS NOT THE CORRECT ONE. I will now go and see if the grand master flash version is correct.
__label__1 vapor fails!: I just bought Rush's Vapor Trails along with Deep Purple's latest, Rapture of the Deep and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience. What a surprise.My two favorite bands seem to be going in different directions and I`m not talking about musical directions. I can't believe how AWFUL Vapor Trails is, the sound quality is just plain bad, the arrangements feel forced and the songs simply aren't good, let alone memorable. The lyrics are good, but that doesn't matter when the rest of it just sits there. I'm struggling just getting through this thing.On the other hand, Rapture of the Deep is everything Vapor Trails isn't. Great performances, fantastic songs, great lyrics, good sound quality. Deep Purple sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the flow of the album is just outstanding.It's safe to say this is not Rush`s finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple`s.Vapor Trails = 1/2 starRapture of the Deep = 4 1/2 stars
__label__2 Good Songs but There are Better Ways to Hear APB: This is a solid collection of early Apop songs but why do this to yourself? Just buy '7' due to its start-to-finish excellence - this is a better intro to APB. Then get the more current 'Welcome to Earth' with at least 5 great songs. If you like those then you can venture deeper in the past and pick up 'Soli Deo Gloria'; you'll find that it is better as an album than this collection. Then go ahead and get the most current disc 'Harmonizer'.In short, good stuff but don't start here. Only for completists IMO (yes, I have it).
__label__1 Psuedo-Mysterious: Hmmm... not sure if I can find the words to describe this one. Trite? Pretenious? Boooooorrrrring? While Kate Fansler is both amatuer sleuth and professor of English, there is absolutely no reason for her to go around spouting off obscure Joycean witticisms to any and everybody (and I actually like Joyce)! For the non-English studies person some parts of the text will make absolutely no sense, and for the English studies person those parts will just seem senseless. I was literally more than 1/3 finished with the book before I realized that the crime had not yet take place because Cross had spent most of that time making sure that the reader was well aware of her knowledge on Joyce....
__label__1 Great concert - awful DVD: I bought this DVD to update a really bad bootleg DVD of the same show. I have dozens of Jeff Beck concert DVDs. This is an important documentary of a significant period (Jennifer Batten / Who Else Tour), obviously professionally filmed, but the DVD quality is AWFUL. A previous reviewer commented on the out-of-synch problems that don't get resolved until 21 minutes into the concert. In addition, my original bootleg has more complete intro into the first track, has no synch problems, does not have spelling mistakes in the menu, and probably cost less. The producers of this DVD should be banned from selling at Amazon unless they totally re-edit this product and send replacement DVDs to all who have purchased this DVD. My recommendation......wait for a better version to appear. You want this concert, but NOT this DVD.
__label__2 Not what you might expect...: This fast-paced adventure gives everyone a character to relate to. Not only is it a clever story with unique characters and clever twists, it also seamlessly incorporates deeper ideas like discrimination, sacrifice, and overcoming traditional barriers. The great thing is that the author weaves these themes in so naturally, you walk away from the book with plenty to think about and keep you amused without feeling at all preached at. As a college student, I am somewhat in the habit of studying and analyzing what I read. This series thrives no matter from what angle it is read from. I enjoy these books as much as I did when I first picked them up for something fun to read years ago."Talis Hunters" is a grand adventure that does honor to the term imaginative!
__label__2 Hooky and accessible: Although I'm having a hard time understanding the lyrics, musically these guys sound like a softer, more accessible Strokes. Right now I'm listening to track #2 "Consolation Prizes", and I really like the rhythm of this track. The rousing drums and guitars have a real Americana rock sound you don't hear that much these days. Vocals, while not so original, are not grating or overproduced. I hear some electronic synths, but they're used in moderation. Nothing on this album is over-produced or overdone. A nice blend of catchy tunes and quirky lyrics.Overall a catchy and easy to listen to album from this french foursome. Well done!
__label__1 Defective Item: I received this item and the blades of the razors were defective (extremely dull, although looked new). I have used the brand of razor blades for over a year and have never had a bad batch like this one. I contacted the seller and they said that I had to contact the manufacturer because they were not responsible for the quality of the products they sell. Very poor customer service. I am now left with 6 worthless razor blades and out the money I spent on them.
__label__1 Face it - O'Reilly is a jerk: The intelligent conservatives I know are embarrassed by people like O'Reilley. Before extreme partisanship flared back up in America, I knew few people on either side who even cared much about him (except for the extremists). Now the average conservative is drawn to people like him? Give me a break. I only read part of this book, I will admit, and it exuded the same unstoppable arrogance and closed-mindedness as he does on his show.Note: I am not a liberal, in fact, I voted for Bush in the last election (but regret it now, seeing how he's poorly handled the issues that have come upon him).
__label__2 Just what was needed: We decided to store many of our linens in these types of product until next winter. We liked the size was enough for two of our blankets and the zipper worked smoothly. Well made and was shipped quickly.
__label__2 Dance to the Piper: (The O'Hurleys): With our youngest graduating and moving out of the house, I decided to start reading again. The kindle was a gift for this purpose. For some reason I started reading books by Nora Roberts and love them. I realized that there is an order to each family series and now read them in the right order so that I get to know each family member really well. The O'Hurley family is a favorite. I really like how each character, in this case Maddy, is presented in a way that you feel as if you know this person and you always get to visit again with the other family members that you have already read about in the series. There are such strong family connections in each of Nora Roberts' books and this is no exception. I always look forward to the next book in the series and usually dive right in. This is a good read and sets up beautifully the next in the series, Skin Deep.
__label__2 Let It Bleed Redux: One of the Stones' best album/cd's. It was great music when it first came out and still is. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to hear the Stones at their best.
__label__2 A must for the family library.: To keep peace in the family, add this classic boy and his dog movie for your wife. My life is easier since I relented to add this movie to my library. I have computer time when she watches this and the Road movies.
__label__2 fun, light-hearted & a great escape: I think it .. started off a little slow .. but once I got into it .. had a hard time putting it down .. really enjoyed it.it was fun .. a great escape!
__label__1 poor quality-huge disappointment: While setting up the product tonight, one of the screws was set wrong and loose, the glue came apart on the two chairs, and as my husband gently placed a chair down for the first time, a chunk of wood split off the chair. We were stunned at the shoddy manufacturing. Will be returning and wishing we'd read these reviews first.
__label__2 Classic Rock that deserved Fame: If it weren't for my friends who were Radio DJs and friend in a rock band I played lead guitar in, I may have never heard of these guys, (just like I can't believe how many people have never heard of the Groundhogs). Since so many below have described the music so incredibly well, I will keep this simple. If you do not own this album, you are missing a unique, "one-of-kind-sound" because Captain Beyond has a kind of spacy hard rock sound that alters your conscious as you listen to it. I got the Album with the 3D cover back in 72 when I was fresh out of high school but have to have the CD to replace that and many well worn LPs and this one is a classic that should be in any classic rock fans collection.
__label__2 Literary community prefigures political change/work: This is an important and imaginative study of the work literary and cultural anthologies do to embody and prefigure forms of politican transformation and to represent engagement. It is an act of an "organic intellectual" in the best Gramscian senses, and makes an important intervention into the makings of Asian American, Pacific, and American studies in this strange and mongrel postcolonial/transnational moment of US remaking. This is a splendid first book, and suggests further scholarship and anthology-making on the Asian/Pacific horizon from Hawai'i.
__label__2 A childhood favorite: This was my favorite book when I was growing up. Each week, when I would go to the library with my mom, I would take this book out. Finally I received a copy as a gift one year! It is fun, playful, silly, engaging.
__label__2 Cazalet Chronicles - great reading: Have just started on my second read through of this wonderful series. The writing is superb, the characters are totally believable, and as a previous reviewer has said - you love most of them and hate a few. These books have me crying one minute and laughing the next. Impossible to put down, they give an accurate and enthralling picture of what life must have been like during those years around the second world war in London and that small, southern part of Britain. I am almost through Marking Time, and can harldly wait to get to the next two books in the series. Then I will be distraught that I have finished once again. Wish there were more!
__label__2 Moving: Emily Watson,thats all it takes.She is one classy actress.And can i just say Hugo Weaving was SO great.I forgot I was watching these people,i felt like these were people i could know and love and I wanted to.The world doesnt have enough movies like this being made and its a shame.I had no idea there was a child holocaust like this. Shame on people.

We will always love traditional pieced and appliqued quilts, but with our fast paced lives, being able to complete a project quickly and easily helps maintain our quilting mental health.

__label__1 BUZZZZZZZ...: I was very pleased with this system for the first month or so I owned it (better speakers would make it much better though..); However, shortly after that it began making a loud intermittent buzzing noise. This noise ranges from almost imperceptible, to so loud it drowns out almost all other audio output. It seems to be coming from the satelite speakers only.I have a friend with a different Sony system and he has a similar problem with his subwoofer. (Maybe this is a problem with Sony products in general?) He tried to get it serviced and was told there was nothing wrong with it. I hope I have better luck, as this can really be a great system on the rare occasion that I can hear it over the sometimes thundering buzz!
__label__2 Excellent Deal: A very beautiful tree! I bought one from Brussel, and another from LOUS bonsai; this one is definitely a real deal; healthy, good trunk, great customer service! Love it.
__label__2 Good Quality - Fair Price: This machine was purchased for my daughter for college. Lightweight, easy use with tools, good suction, fair price. I would recommend this purchase again!
__label__2 THE LAST ONE: FRANK SINATRA BOWS OUT WITH HIS FINAL NEW STUDIO RECORDING ON THIS ABSOLUTE CLASSIC,"SHE SHOT ME DOWN". THE COVER AND THE TITLE OF THIS RECORD IS ENOUGH TO SEND ANY SINATRA FAN ON HIS WAY TO FIND THIS GEM. THEY SHOULD START TO RENAKE THIS CD AS USED COPIES GO FOR OVER $ 149.00 ON EBAY AND AMAZON.COM. I PURCHASED 3 COPIES YEARS AGO AT A MUSIC STORE AND THE GUY ASKED ME WHY I WAS BUYING 3, I TOLD HIM," I HAVE A FEELING THE RECORD COMPANY IS GOONA PULL THIS ONE BECUASE IT DIDNT REALLY SELL WELL AT THAT TIME" HE LAUGHED AND SAID,"YOU THINK YOU STROKE GOLD OR SOMETHING THE WAY YOUR SO HAPPY PAYING $ 15.99 EACH,. I TOLD HIM," IM THRILLED TO BE PAYING $ 15.99 EACH" 15 YEARS LATER WHO HAS THE LAST LAUGH......
__label__2 T.P for the bum: I know most people dont like scott but we love it. It might be thin but it lasts FOREVER!!! I like fluffy toilet paper but at times you have to use a lot and taking the risk of clogging the toilet. lol I am happy with this product! Will be back
__label__1 The Movie Is Great...But this release is terrible: Thank god I saw this before I bought it. I was not impressed with this version at all. The quality was just not there, for picture & music.I'll stick to my 80's version of the classic, it was released though "Vestron Video", and its been modified.But this version has some cool groups from the 80's that performed on the soundtrack, such as Bonnie Tylor, Queen, Jon Anderson, Lover Boy, ect, and I do belive it is a classic to be experienced.Now, this is not the fully restored version, but it is very clear and clean.
__label__1 Lots of Problems with Windows 2000 and XP: We had several machines with Windows 2000 and Windows XP with EASY CD Creator 5.0. Only about 20% did not have problems. We installed every patch and upgrade Roxio recommended. Bought all types of approved CDR media. All the CDR/CDRW drives were fully approved and popular brands. Once we moved to other CDR burning software , the problems went away. Many of the problems included stability problems, un-reliable CD recording, and general crashing. Removed Roxio products all the problems are gone.
__label__2 Soul Searching - find it here!: This book was required reading for a Philosophy course. You might think why would they read children's books in college? But The Little Prince is a spiritual epiphany disguised as a kid's story. This newer translation is not as moving as the the Katherine Woods translation - please read her version first! You will agree
__label__2 A Pioneer Tale of Courage and Tragedy: The Children's Blizzard is a fascinating tale of the tragic blizzard striking without warning to the Prairie states in 1888. As an Iowa native I was fascinated by the human stories told by Mr. Laskin. His research is impeccable an he provides touching insight into the life of the midwest pioneer families and most importantly the children. My only criticism would be the sometimes redundant very dry information about weather systems and predictions. It is interesting to a point but most probably only those as fascinated by weather as the author would find it necessary to the degree it is explained. The human story is the more intriquing. Regardless, I loved the book and am incredibly grateful to those hardy souls who stayed in the prairies despite the harshest of circumstances. I can't imagine living then. Thanks to Mr. Laskin for exploring their lives and telling the truth.
__label__1 The most biased book, I've ever read.: I am taking a class where this book is required. It takes no time at all to realize that the author has a "hate america agenda". The source information is pretty good, however, it's how he interprets....The worst being that he described one of the most influential men in american history, as a rich white guy....That would be Benjamin Franklin. Thats all Zinn had to say about this founding father. After this, I had no respect for any ideas this self admitted anarchist, had to say.
__label__2 A Treasure for the Interview Process: This book was recommended by a colleague. The book was worth it's weigh in gold. The information assisted in completing chapters 4 and 5 of a dissertation. I would highly recommend the book for anyone using interviews as a research instrument.
__label__2 Rather Funny and Strange: Ben Affleck plays an arrogant man yearning for a family he doesn't have. There is a bit of a moral message here, that material possessions alone cannot make us happy. Affleck plays the eccentric millionaire very humorously, and we all may be able to relate to this spoiled man who thinks he can buy everything in life including love. James Gandolfini is very funny in his role too!
__label__1 Another Sellout Pop Album: I listened to the album, and although it's not bad, it's nothing special. It's just another blonde Britney-like pop album, where the lyrics are as meaningful to me as much as an apple means something to a fish. I never liked her music all that much, but at least she had a niche. Over and over again, I've tried to see why people think she's so pure, intelligent and honest, but I've yet to see it. Now it's gotten to a point, where you can't tell her apart from all the other dumb blonde pop wannabes out there. Total sellout album. Just read her interviews. She's sold herself out. If you like the old Jewel, buy her first or second album. Other than that, don't bother. With each album she just gets worse, and this one's proof of that. Nothing original about this one. Buy Avril Lavigne instead.
__label__2 BioSil: This really works for me, and where I live no stores carry it; so I am really happy to be able to go online and purchase it.
__label__2 Love this Kettle!: I've used this kettle for going on 3 years and have never had the problems listed here. Maybe a break-in period is necessary? I'm a tea drinker so use my kettle daily, usually more than once. It quickly heats water to boiling and turns off when it reaches the correct temperature. One note: be sure to have the water cover the silvery heating element in the bottom. When my sister was visiting, she liked this so much she immediately went on Amazon and ordered herself one so it would be waiting for her upon her return.I don't write many reviews, but seeing the negative ones here, wanted to highly recommend this product and share my experiences.
__label__1 Reach excedes grasp: I like Greil's approach, which worked so much better in the recent "Like A Rolling Stone: Bob Dylan At The Crossroads", of honing in on small detail to produce something profound. Maybe this book can be considered practice for the latter, because it simply didn't work here. I welcome experimental writing, but in this case the wash of minute detail combined with nonlinearity produced confusion rather than clarity. I'm afraid for me the insights are Greil's alone rather than universal. To his credit though, in the same way I'd rather see an ambitious indie movie that fails than a Hollywood blockbuster, reading this is worth a shot. I may try again some time.
__label__1 Did not come as described: The sword pictured and described showed a guard with a really nice pirate ship engraving. When the sword came in, it didn't have the guard. After multiple emails between amazon and the vendor, I only got a partial refund. The vendor said it was out of their hands and than amazon had to handle it, so I gave up. Disappointing experience, as this is probably the first time I've had a bad transaction on amazon.com.
__label__1 Hoped it was better: My husband heard one song of this album on the radio and ordered the CD. He was disappointed.
__label__2 A True Blessing: I have been stuggling with a lot of issues with being a real man, not just a Christian but as a man of God. This book has opened my heart and mind up to be able to face these issues head on and it gives me the tools to make the necessary changes in my life. Tony Evans has done an excellent job with this book and I will recommend it to all the brothers as a need to have to help in their Christain walk.
__label__2 fits the budget: this shed is pretty sturdy once assembled. We bought wood for the flooring and anchored it all down. It did not come with any kind of latch or lock for the door
__label__2 A good overview, shame about the editing: Mark Carlotto is a name closely associated with the Face on Mars controversy ever since the early 1980s. He writes well, dispassionately outlining the difficulties he and other researchers have faced in getting to the bottom of what is one of the most profound mysteries to confront us - is there evidence of intelligent design on the Cydonia plains of Mars? The main drawback however, to what is an excellent book is the annoying spelling errors that are a tad too numerous for my liking. Also, the pictures would have more impact if the paper quality had been better, or if they were presented in colour. Which is why I'm giving the book only 4 stars - better quality, spelling, editing and it would warrant 5 stars.
__label__1 Where's the Humor????: Blistering, malicious, and not all that funny--this book goes from bad to worse in a New York minute. I half expected George to blast my Grandma, or even his Grandma for that matter! I understand sattire, but it doesn't need to be this vicious. George should try some Ritalin before he writes his next book.
__label__2 Dog Lover Having Second Thoughts: I am a huge dog lover, but this movie had me looking at canines in a different light for quite some time while I was little. For some reason, I always relate this movie to "Sandlot," but this dog really was ridiculously mean. The scene in the junkyard made my eyes widen a couple times, and I'd give this movie four stars for being entertaining. Scary? Not at all. The book was even more grotesque, and I enjoyed every minute of it. All I kept thinking through the book and the movie was "What is taking so long for someone to shoot this dog?!"
__label__1 Cinderella DVD: I ordered this movie for my child for Easter. It plays just fine on our new DVD player, but our older DVD player won't recognize it at all and neither will our computer.
__label__2 If you have never been there, you now know it: This is a wonderful book which, as an Anglophile, I loved reading. Just a word to those who feel it some of the terms are American. Remember, please, that the author is now living in the US, and new terms become automatically one's own after a while. And yes, there is a sequel to this book!
__label__2 Great Little Drill: I already had a Hitachi 12 volt cordless drill but I enjoyed it so much that I wanted a second one so I could leave the old one at the cottage. My wife and I do all our own building and renovations and this little 12 volt is great for a multitude of construction jobs because it is light and compact. I especially like it for drywall because of its size and the fact that it has a belt clip. My first one has seen a lot of use in the four years I have had it and the battery packs are still well over 50 percent. More that I can say for some other cordless drills I have had. Keep in mind that it is a 12 volt and as such is limited in the jobs it is designed for. I have stronger drills for the big jobs. But if you are looking for a light drill to do all but the heavy work, I highly recommend the Hitachi DS12DVF3.
__label__1 Tingley Rubber hightop overshoes: they came in right away but were way too large - we need to send them back - can you help me with a return label?
__label__1 thule 962xt: Mediocre product. despite it being a "three bike rack" I have only figured out how to get two bikes at a time on it. A friend says if he takes off all the front wheels on his bikes he manages to get three on. If I have to dis-assemble the bikes, I can just throw the pieces in the trunk. If the bars the bikes hang on were about two inches closer together and were totally straight instead of having a bend in the last couple of inches where they go into the trunk mount part; maybe three would fit. The purchase and delivery were smooth and efficient.
__label__1 Disappointed: I read this book because it was recommended by a friend as a "funny' book. As other readers have mentioned, indeed it does not take long to read but I found it completely stupid and with absolutely no point. I would never bother again reading another of this author's books.
__label__1 get the LP instead: track down the LP of this one as there is about 10 minutes missing in the CD.... I am so sad & I wished for better, the LP is 4 stars
__label__2 Love it: Organizing your bathtub is made simple with this product. You do have to press a few times to get the amount you want but I still love it. The basket is a wonderful touch. Shipping took forever so don't expect to receive this product within 3 weeks time.
__label__2 Whoops! Wrong bible!: This is a protestant bible which doesn't contain all the books of the Old Testament (Maccabees I, II are missing, for example). I should have bought a catholic version, so my mistake, and it is too heavy to ship back. So I donated it to a protestant church. I wish there was a St. Joseph's bible in Super Giant Print, but I haven't been able to find one.
__label__2 Well Built Chairs!!!: Great Product, at an excellent price$$ !!! I bought these for a Christmas gift and my daughter-inlaw loves them.Thank YouRon from Dover, Pa
__label__1 The ending fizzles.: It's basically a two hour long chase across country with murders along the way. They call it a "modern western" because hat color doesn't correlate with integrity. The main characters commit atrocities, but you're supposed to identify with them at different times because they can be rationalized as "victims." There is a bizarre point where Angelica Huston materializes and the moviemakers seem to be striving for some kind of morality play. Just when you expect a dramatic twist and final conflict resolution, the characters turn indecisive and the movie ends. It's really weird. I have seen movies fizzle before, but this one really fizzles!I will say however that the chase is engaging, for the first hour at least.
__label__1 Disappointed: I loved this bag. It was exactly what I wanted...lightweight, roomy, water resistant. I was so disappointed to realize that after less than a month the material right next to the straps was ripping on three of the four straps! I was using it as a pool bag so it was packed with several towels, goggles, sunscreen. Nothing heavy that would have stressed the material too much. Returned it for a refund.
__label__1 Just not tough enough.: I bought this about a year and a half ago. I make blackberry jam and needed it to puree the berries and get some of the seeds out. It never did a very good job. It didn't put enough pressure on the fruit so I ended up with a good deal of waste. The second summer I used it the handle fell off (poorly soldered). Then the knob on top came off and I couldn't get it back on so ended up pitching the whole thing. It might be up to wimpy stuff like applesauce, but if you are a serious canner, find something stronger.
__label__1 Biggest disappointment ever!!!: If I could give this movie a lower rating I'd do it, it deserves more of a 0.16 of a star. This movie was horrible, not a good ending at all, the casting was fair, but not great. The graphics were so-so, but not as good as I expected & hoped. This movie by far (besides Gigli) has to be the biggest disappointment. I wish it would've flopped in the box office, but like idiots we go see it & leave in shock of the suckiness that took place. When the movie ended you were like "that's it, that sucked." I don't care if you vote that this review wasn't helpful, you know it was, because deep down inside (if you saw the movie) that it sucked terribly, admit it, & vote that I was helpful...horrible movie, one of the worst...
__label__2 Albert Collins With Barrelhouse: This is a live recording of Albert Collins playing with a band from Europe. The band includes guys with names like Hans and Guus. The band is good. Albert Collins is hot.The CD includes a couple of tracks that do not include Albert's telecaster or his voice. The lead singer of Barrelhouse has a voice similar to that of Ashlee Simpson.But on the tracks that Mr. Collins plays on, he is hot, and his telecaster is just as smooth. This CD shows his versatility, his ability to play in different situations.Overall, a good CD.
__label__2 Mahjongg Platinum 2 for PC: Mahjongg Platinum Deluxe EditionI'm so pleased with this game. It has so many variations and levels that I think I will be playing mahjongg for a long time. The colors are bright and the signs are easy to see and it is just perfect for me.
__label__1 If you're not a rocket scientist...look elsewhere.: I couldn't believe how much time it took me to set up a clock radio! The "control panel" is far from intuitive. After so many years of setting up digital watches, car radios, stereos, vcrs etc., I rarely use a manual. Not with the "Dream Machine" ,however. I can't believe sony would make this so difficult.Once in use, you will NOT be positively impressed with the sound quality or the brightness of the LCD screen. It's a nice green color tho...You can find better for less money. Keep looking!
__label__1 Wood can crack easily: If you're the type that likes to use your own screws, and get all industrial, be very gentle screwing your screws in or you'll screw up the wood. Mine cracked, even when I was being gentle on the second screw. If I'd known that, I would have bought its metal cousin.
__label__1 Not perfect!: I have been feeding hummingbirds for a while. There are a few things that surprise me with Perky pet feeders: yellow draws the attention of bees is the big thing- I have several of their feeders and learned to paint the yellow -red. The other matter has to do with this particular feeder. Mine leaked through on of the yellow flowers. No matter what I did it leaked. Lots of sugar water feeding not only yellow jackets but also ants.There is a better feeder made by Woodstream no yellow and a built in ant moat on the top of the feeder. The birds love it. It is the same size but the little white slot for the birds to feed and the built in perch seems to work better for me... and them. no more painting yellow red! and same price. Someone should but an bee in Perky pets ear about the yellow. As for the leaking. The feeder resides in the basement. A lesson learned.
__label__1 Junk!: This workout has no warmup and no cooldown. It's the worst workout I've ever bought. I actually threw it in the trash.
__label__1 This DVD has the distributor's logo in the bottom right corner of screen: This title is not the Criterion issue, it is from Reel Enterprises. They put their logo "RE" in large letters in the lower right corner of the screen during the film.I paid for this DVD and should not have to watch an ad from some film distributor while I am trying to enjoy the film. "My Man Godfrey" gets 5 stars but putting an ad on the DVD or some low rent copy protection gets it one.
__label__1 Don't start this book!: There's little I hate more than reading a book only to find out I have to wait another year to finish it. This book is very much a cliffhanger, so wait until the sequel is out to even start it. The story itself is good, if a bit too detailed in the grisly parts and a bit long-winded in places. If they'd warned me ahead of time that it was only half a book, I'd probably rate it 4*'s
__label__2 GREAT! WONDERFUL!: I have purchased these towels before and they arrive when promised. They are just as described. I will definitely keep on ordering.
__label__2 Clorox Toilet Wand Cleaning Refills: I love this way of cleaning the toilets, It's not messy! however when pricing buying the boxes of 6 individually, it was so expensive. Buying in bulk saves money and shopping time. Thanks Amazon!
__label__2 Gift of these tongs went out with the Lenox Ice Bucket.: The lady was swooning over the ice bucket and the tongs. These tongs were carefully selected among a group of tongs.
__label__2 A ComfortSport I'm Comfortable With: My baby girl is small, however when she outgrew her rear facing Graco car seat (which I was very happy with), I wanted to find a similar Graco product to replace it. The ComfortSport newborn/toddler carseat was difficult to install rear facing, and difficult to adjust the straps that loosen and tighten. However, since this was only effective for 3 months before she hit the 20 lb, 1 year old, wt./age mark, I wouldn't say that it was a big issue. Once we turned the seat forward facing the install (using the LATCH system) was a breeze, and we had no problem adjusting the straps. The seat fits nice and secure in my car and my daughter appers to be comfortable in it. I also love how easy it is to wash the cover for the seat, it velcros on and off so you don't have to take the seat out of your car (car seats get so crapped up from sippy cup spills and food crumbs) it's nice to be able to wash it often.
__label__2 The Funniest Film Ever Made: THE HOLY GRAIL is the finest work from the esteemed British comedy troup Monty Python. Their hilarious skewering of the myth of King Arthur and the Round Table is successful on so many levels that it makes one, well, laugh out load and smirk with knowing admiration. From gross physical humor(the Black Knight losing his limbs in combat, but refusing to give in) to pungent socail commentary (most of the movie) the Pythons deliver over and over.I have seen this numerous times (40?) over the years and still can be reduced to painfull fits of laughter by at least several scenes. Do you need any other recommendation?
__label__2 Excellent Can Crusher: This can crusher is one of the easiest to use. It is made of durable, yet lightweight materials. With the optional attachable collection bin, it is truly a one step process. You don't need the strength of a gorilla to crush a can. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a top notch can crusher.
__label__1 Digital trickery: What a disappointment - a translation from German without the translator's name, without any reference to the title in the original version. Notes at the end of the book do not have any references to the page they refer to... This book and the book my husband earlier purchased (same author, same title but different layout) signify a new era of digital trickery - quick publishing from digitally engineered content with no ownership for the quality and authorship. Who is being paid??
__label__1 Why Was This Published: I think that if this had not been written by Andrew Holleran,it would not have been published. It is not so much a novelas a collection of "thoughts" that are fairly sophmoric, ifnot trite. I tried to finish it, but it kept on putting me tosleep. I'd try this book instead of Ambien.
__label__1 Only if there is nothing else to watch: Watched a few minutes and decided that I would stick to American television. There are some British shows that I watch, but this one won't be one of them.
__label__2 A quick, good read: I liked this book a lot. A difffent story, not a typical love story. I read it in two days.
__label__1 Great fun movie.... but the DVD ruins it.: Ok this movie was good but the DVD is simply not worth getting. Paramount has major issues with DVD's. I dont think they like them becuase hardly any Paramount movies have special features. All this has is a trailer. But that should'nt count as a special feature becuase every DVD has a trailer. They didnt even bother to add production notes or cast/crew biograhpies. I hope that Paramount can one day set aside they're DVD issues and make a a jammed packed DVD like Gladiator or something. Oh, if you do buy this movie dont bother getting Escape From L.A. beucase you will just be paying for the same movie twice as they are both the same movie.
__label__1 Recorded on a tape recorder in a shoe box.: The sound on this CD is crap, it sounds like you are outside the concert hall listing to this. Grab a copy of the UK 12" singles of I am I'm Me and The Kids are Back if you can which have three live songs each and really shows the true power of the SMF's live.
__label__2 Simpl and Elegant: I brought two of these rings I like them so much. There not big and gaudy and I have many copliments on it. People always want to know what the words and symbols mean. this is a great buy for the price
__label__2 Liked it: If you like first shooter games, this is a really good one. The enemies adapt to your tactics, so you have to change stratagies fairly often. There are several vehicles to drive, and they respond differently depending on their size. I didn't like the fact that there is no parking brake, so if you stop to use the guns, the vehicle usually rolls so it is hard to target anything. And usually if you spend time trying to crawl through the bushes and sneak up on enemies they see you anyway so it is a waste of time. But those are only a few issues I had with a really outstanding game. It is worth the money, especially now that it is old and cheap.
__label__2 Great toy but battery does not hold charge: This toy is great but the rechargable battery doesn't work for long (less than 30 seconds after charging for 5 hours). Hopefully it is just a battery problem.
__label__2 Great Book!: I am a beginner at making music and this book has been extremely helpful. Detailed and clear instructions show the experience of the writer. Can be quite technical at times but better more than less information. Well worth the money!
__label__2 A Good Basic Book for Barbie Knitters: On the plus side, this book has beautiful photogaphy and simple but very pretty styles, designed with an appropriate gauge (mostly about 6 to 8 stitches per inch).The most noticeable flaw: there are several mistakes in the instructions. It's not hard to figure out the corrections, but gee whiz, didn't anybody proofread this before it was printed?This book is ideal for beginning to intermediate knitters, who mostly want to make clothes for their kids' dolls. Advanced knitters and doll collectors, who prefer more complex, sophisticated shaping and fit, will probably find the patterns in this book too basic.
__label__2 EXCELLENT MUSIC: LOVE THIS CD AND ALBANO & ROMINA. BEAUTIFUL SONGS ABOUT LIFE AND LOVE. THESE TWO WERE REALLY IN LOVE AT THAT TIME.
__label__1 More BS delays: I love how when you review a game on Amazon, it asks you how much fun it is based on 1-5 stars.FUNNY HOW IT ISNT OUT YET, ONLY A SELECT FEW OF YOU MAY HAVE ACTUALLY PLAYED AN ADVANCED BETA COPY OF THE GAME, AND YOU'RE ALL GIVING IT 5 STARS!!!Why not wait till you actually have a copy of the game in your hands (like that will ever happen any time soon) to write a review. Hell, if you're gonna review this game, while you're at it, you might as well write a review for HL 3 at the same time. Get a jump posting a pointless opinion on something else you've never played.Wouldnt it be ironic if this game sucked as much as the infinite amount of pointless delays. Alright, Im bored with this. Im done. Enjoy reviewing your game.
__label__1 Bio wheel is always stopping: After the first month or so, the bio wheel would stop spinning - not just slow, but stop altogether. I was advised by store personnel and the Marineland hotline to clean the impeller, well and tube. I've done that several times with little change. The wheel would move a little, then stop. I've tried changing the filter frequently, still no effect. Should I change the impeller? I'm thinking of scrapping the unit and go with an Emperor 280 - it has two pumps, one for filtration and the other for the bio wheel.
__label__2 Versatile: Great device! Helps in taking night pictures (long shutter exposure), definitely great with taking timed picture shots. You need to look for something to attach it on if you want some height.
__label__1 Very Displeased!: SinceI grew up with always having a cup dispenser in the bathroom and in the kitchen , so it was natural that in my own home that I would have them as well...I was so excited about the design and the ultra modren look of this one as I searched for one for the batthroom, but alas when it arrived, it didn't work with the the plastic or the paper cups! It baffles me that after trying two sizes (2oz & 3 oz) why the manufacturer would put out such a faulty product? Aren't these things tested? I was so dissapointed, not to mention the cups the cups that were needlessly wasted because I kept trying to 'make' them 'fit'!Thanks for NothingDissatisfied in Clarksville
__label__2 I couldn't put it down!: I thought this book was great and was quite suprised to see it got less than 5 stars. Perhaps it is because I have not read her historicals, thus had different expectations. Whatever the reason, I very much enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who likes contemporary romance.
__label__1 Burn BEFORE reading: Ursula K. Le Guin is my favorite writer. That is why I advise you: do not read this book. It is surely the worst of Le Guin's novels and I hope the author is ashamed of it and wants to forget that she ever wrote it. (But I am not sure if my hope is well located.)
__label__1 Disappointing: This is a 1:75,000 scale map of the Colorado Springs area west of I25, showing only a small part east of I25. I bought it thinking it would show me trails where I could walk. The scale is too small to do this in a helpful way. The reverse of the map has a partial list of trails; because it's a sheet publication it cannot describe all the trails in such a large area. There is an enlarged map of the Garden of the Gods park, but you can get a more useful one free at the Visitors' Center. I ended up getting another publication. This is a pretty map to hang on a wall, but the scale is too small to be useful for a hiker looking for a trail to suit his/her abilities and interests.
__label__1 Terrible: This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I do recommend that you go to the video store and rent the video, just so you can see how bad it is for yourself. I'd say that if you compared this movie to Plan Nine from Outer Space, Plan Nine wins hands down. If you want to know the story of the movie or whatever, just go get the older one, its much better.
__label__2 A no-nonsense introduction to improving one's skill: Play Winning Chess by International Grand Master Yasser Seirawan, is a no-nonsense introduction to improving one's skill at the classic game of chess. Basic tactics, the rules of play, question-and-answer sections, black-and-white photographs and chess diagrams, and much, much more make Play Winning Chess an excellent introduction to using clever attacks and deceptive defenses. ...
__label__1 Shipping ripoff: I didn't buy this ball because I read other reviews that say that the ball arrives in a small envelope and yet they are trying to charge me $14 for shipping it. Seems ridiculous, even though this one seemed like the best choice for the money.
__label__2 easy instruction: The last 2 chapters may come in handy over the years, but the first 3/4 of the book are excellent
__label__1 tight shoes: i like teva shoes and sandals but this one is tight. my little one can hardly push his toes in front.
__label__1 POS: This phone is the worst phone I ever had. My mother in law bought the phone for my wife and I. She meant well, but everytime I use this phone, I end up cursing her. Numbers on both phones don't work when pressed. Thankfully I programed some numbers day one and can dial them using the stored number feature. If I ever had to dial 911, I would die trying to dial the number. Actually made me long for the days of rotary phones....yeah it took a little longer to dial , but those phones lasted for ever
__label__2 Great Price!: Got this card to renew my current account and it worked great! It was $40.00 which made it $10.00 cheaper than renewing it with Microsoft! Great deal!
__label__1 You get what you pay for!: Meh.. Bought 3 pairs at a buck or so each. One pair lasted about a week before the mesh on one side fell off. The grey covering just below the earbud slides right off the bud itself and often moves creating noise on top of the music. Audio quality isn't even good enough for gym use.At such a low price, we wouldn't expect much, but I would think you might as well not even sell anything this cheap.
__label__1 Tangible intangibles??: Suppose a company puts a lot of money and effort in the research and design of a product. These are intangibles. The product, however, does not sell. The research and design have not turned into tangible profits. Then what? In my opinion, they are wasted. This is market risk. Intangibles matter only when they turn into tangibles.
__label__1 Junk. Don't Buy!!: I purchased on of these on March 10th 2010 and installed on my new deck about a month later. It worked great for about 6 months than the timer stopped working and I had to turn them on and off manually. I got tired of that and purchased another one about a month ago and just threw the packaging out and less than 30 days after I installed this one the timer stopped working so now I have to of these pieces of garbage in my garage. Spend a little more and get a better one.
__label__1 A STRONG SOUR FRAGRANCE: FOR ALL OF THE POSITIVE THINGS I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS FRAGRANCE, I ORDERED IT AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FRAGRANCE. I HAVE USED IT ONCE AND WILL PROBABLY NEVER TRY IT AGAIN. ACQUA DI PARMA COLONIA IS WAY TOO UNPLEASANT FOR MY TASTES.
__label__2 diego diego: si te gusta diego y su musica tiene que tener este cd. en unplugged suena muy bien y si te gusta su ritmo entonces compralo.
__label__2 Surprisely good: When I first heard the BEPs, I didnt really like them, now that I listened to a friends cd fully and bought my own I love them. Elephunk is my favorite of their albums. My 15 month old even bops to the beats!
__label__1 Wrong Item: Label shows 20 gauge, but it's more like 24 or 26 gauge wire: very thin, waste of money.If all user complain constantly, it's best for merchant to take a look what they're selling; if they can't distinguish 20 between 26 gauge, they should NOT sell it.
__label__1 hard shoes: shoes, hard, rough, uncomfortable to use, they have hurt my feet, and I have almost no use them; regret that a brand like SEBAGO have concessions that discredit, I hope they give me some alternative change, thanks.
__label__2 A very unique and entertaining plot: This is one of those fiction stories that remains with you long after you've read it. I enjoyed the book, then loaned it to a friend, but never got it back. The plot continued to tease my mind, so I purchased the book again years later. Since I read a lot, it isn't often that I remember story lines in that way. It changed the way I looked at my family history.
__label__2 Excellent for Beginners!: If you are a beginning programmer, then you will find this book to be of great value to you because of its detailed step-by-step instructions of what to do. However, if you are already somewhat familiar with object-oriented languages, including C,C++,Java, or JavaScript, then this book will be mostly review. Otherwise, this is a great book to learn the basics of Visual C++ and object-oriented programming
__label__1 Not good for those with swollen tendons: I have swollen Achilles tendons and wearing these things creates nothing but pain and discomfort.This product might very well work to prevent swelling, by supporting to the tendon, but it certainly dosnt help if you have swelling.
__label__1 clics sun glasses: I'm a huge clics fan. Over the years I've gone thru several pair of the "cheaters". They're so great! You should only need one pair. Alas, old age is bisexual...we're screwed by Mother Nature and F'd by Father Time..so, as the eyes aged I needed to upgrade my readers...and vanity dictated a need for newer styles. Again, part of that aging thing. When the looks start to fade, we accessorize more.However, the sun glasses were a total bust. Too big. They just never fit right. Plus, there was huge distortion in the lenses. They were tossed around in my car for 8 months until one day I was stopped at a light. I gave them to a homeless man in the cross walk. Since then, we've both been grateful.
__label__2 Touching, tender and tragic: A life cut far too short. Heartwarming reading in a heartbreaking context
__label__1 poor design: One side of the pendant is stamped with the silver mark. The way it hangs on the chain, the pendant flips over constantly, so you can see the stamp. We're sending it back!
__label__1 WARNING! Beatles' purists do not buy this CD.: I had to give this CD 1 star because the Amazon rating system would not accept a zero star rating. By looking at the album cover I thought I was buying a new release of Beatles music like the "One" CD. This CD is some pretentious idiots' idea of art, to mess up the Beatle's music. In fact the insert contains boastings of these self proclaimed artists. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Hats off to Buffett!: I ordered this for my niece, I read it and it is wonderful! I will be puchasing another copy for my child as well. This book takes your imagination far away to Bananaland where things are peaceful and happy! If only the real world could be so wonderful. This tale will delight readers of all ages! Buffett has done a great job with his awesome imagination! All of his books are a breath of fresh air for the weary mind. He should write more than he does! And Lambert Davis did a great job with his colorful images, you felt like Bananaland was real!
__label__2 a different view: I think the previous reviewer is a little harsh. I would call the quality of the projects "varied", which is to be expected when there are 20 different designers. I thought most were ho-hum, but a few quite nice, including the eyeglass case on the cover. I think "grade-school level" is an exaggeration--most of the projects are fairly simple, but some show interesting techniques and/or would be suitable for a beginning (adult) quilter, especially one who doesn't necessarily want to tackle a bed-size quilt. Also, instructions are clear and templates are provided--I've definitely seen "project" books that are a lot worse!
__label__2 One of the best recordings of Branderburg concertos: I own quite a few recordings of the Branderburg concertos (Suzuki, Saval, Boston Baroque...) this one is one of the best.There is an evident feel of musical joy coming out of this recording. I can't find other ways to describe it.The musicians are enthusiastic about the work they are playing, restrained most of the time but when it is called for they give their best.Highly recommended.
__label__2 The Best Recording of the Ninth: This is absolutely the best recording of the Ninth out there. It far surpasses that of Karajan, who (despite fine recordings of some of the other Bruckner symphonies, most notably the Sixth) does not appear to like the Ninth that much. Walter seems to understand exactly what Bruckner had in mind, and always gets the tempo and the instrumental balance just right. What's more, the sound of the recording is quite good good given its age.Until you have heard Walter's interpretation, you just haven't heard the Ninth.
__label__2 Our Wedding Anniversary Memory Book: I got this book for my husband for our first anniversary. I figured it covered the paper aspect as well as the time aspect of the gift giving. We enjoyed filling out the book together. The illustrations are beautiful.
__label__2 A Blender that really blends!: I found this blender listed in Good Housekeeper's archive for the best blenders. I have to say I completely agree with the rave. It does an awesome job with blending everything together without chunks. Also, the presentation of the blender is very classy as well!
__label__2 Love you forever: This is a great book. I have given several copies of this book to new mommies. The downside is I made the mistake of going to the authors website and listened to his reading of the story. It sounds like he is reading the funny pages. Maybe that was his intent, for it to be funny, not a sentimental one. I like the sentimental sounding version.
__label__2 Very sturdy construction - excellent grill: This is a very sturdily made hibachi, not like the throw-awayitems that one usually finds in the lawn and garden center of the local department store. The heavy gauge cast-iron construction will ensure that this grill lasts for a long time. The grilling surface is large enough to comfortably fit a few large steaks or many burgers. Grilling over charcol with a bit of mesquite or other wood chip thrown in gives a wonderful flavour to the food.
__label__1 Website down: The related website to this book is down. The sample programs and computer output using sAS and R now are not available. That's the main reason I wanted to buy the book. Supprisingly, the website is not hosted on the publisher's website, but on the first author's personal website in a edu domain.
__label__1 lacks depth: I tend to agree with reviewer from Sunnyvale, Ca. I am currently on page 85 of book, and have been informed perhaps ten times, that Joan is a. obbsessed with movies and, for some unknown reason, enamoured of cooking....and that Emma is artistic, by reason of carrying around a sketch pad , musically inclined, so far one sentence to that effect; and also studious and full of wanderlust to see captols of the world..for me, none of the characters in the book seem particularly interesting due to lack of depth. If this were an layperson's autobiographical memoir of a childhood in wartime Hong Kong, I would find it much more engrossing for the insights into two particular young girl's lives, but I believe literature demands more of a professional writer.
__label__1 very disappointed: In an attempt to improve a weak signal I routed a cable to the second floor and using the wire antenna that came with the receiver improved the signal but it was still staticy. Thought the Terk amplified antenna would for sure improve this situation since I was getting a signal already. But no the signal was totally lost. Moved it around the room, adjusted the gain all to no avail. Wasted $34.00, shame on me.
__label__2 A Fun Flick: Independence Day is a comic book movie and is best enjoyed watching it with that mind set.The Blu-Ray version of this movie is amazing although I was disappointed to see a black dot artifact hanging around on the upper left portion of the screen during the opening and for the first several minutes of the movie.But overall, it is a good transfer and the sound is incredible.
__label__2 One of the best books you'll ever read!: In a world of fast-food reading, this one is a true, rare delicacy. The full 933 pages makes you work for it. But if after 13 years and 3 re-writes, the author still manages to put it on paper and write a book this size, there's something he wants to say. You'll be greatly rewarded reading this book! From the moment I read the opening paragraph I was hooked. He takes you places most of us will never see and shares his intimtimate stories of love, loss, and friendship and through his dark tales of drug addiction, violence, and organized crime. Through it all, he connects with his readers and gives them one tremendous, thrilling story!
__label__2 Focus on Technology: This show tells the story of D-Day, with a strong emphasis on the development of new ideas and strategies for dealing with the problems caused by launching such a large invasion. For example: the Germans installed many obstacles on the beach that would be hidden in the water at high tide. So what did the Allies do? Land at low tide!The stories behind some of the new technology are reviewed in depth: the "Higgins Boat," which was modified into a landing craft; "floating tanks," which would be launched at sea and hopefully would make it to the beach and lend vital support to the infantry; and Percy Hobart's many innovations for overcoming obstacles on the beaches: the "flail tank," the "Bobbin tank," and more. Also included in the program are interviews with several veterans of the battle, including one old soldier from Germany. They share their memories of that fateful day and give the viewer an idea of what it was like to be on the Normandy beaches on June 6, 1944.Four stars!
__label__1 so sad: I have always been surprised that there hasn't been more of an outcry over changes in the music particularly in ROTJ. It is painful to sit through the new jaba music-carton section and the music at the end that replaces the ewok song is so bad. so cheesey. just another reason to hate the "New Versions". in some ways i am looking forward to new changes since the old ones were so bad maybe these will be updated. blablabla
__label__1 Lousy Movie: I must not have researched this movie enough before buying the DVD. I was immediately surprised by two things: (1) it's in black & white (the colored cover is deceiving) and (2) it is a French film that is mainly spoken in French although dubbed in English. The big problem with the movie, however, is that it just doesn't flow right. It bounces around too much and is not focused enough. It's just not very interesting, although it recovers some toward the end when the allies entered Paris. My 2-star rating is based on the interesting ending (it was 1-star up until then). I must say that the black & white nature of the film allowed the film-makers to blend in historical footage of Paris during that time period. Much of the ending, for instance, was historical footage of the victorious walk down the Champs-Elysees. It's a long movie, and the wait for the moving end wasn't worth it. I'll probably not watch this again.
__label__2 An Indepth Spiritual Study of the Mass: This book is a must for anyone who wishes to deepen his or her understanding of the Mass, and to participate more fully in its spiritual dimensions. One cannot read this book without coming away with an increased sense of the sacred.
__label__1 ishiguro at his best? what a disappointment: i'm quite amazed at the many good reviews this book has received. Finishing this book is like having a nice discussion with a friend who, at the end of the hour, tells you he's dosed your tea with LSD. Is he serious? Why would he possibly do such a thing? This writing is nicely crafted and subtle, the narrative shifts easily between London and flashbacks to postwar Nagasaki, and beautifully skates along the rim of cultural chasm. But the `surprise twist ending' is silly, amateurish; like mixing coca cola and Bordeaux, the climactic melange of genre falls on its face. For a beautiful cross cultural novel that carries itself through from beginning to end, skip "pale view' and go straight to `the samarai's garden'.
__label__2 The Best!: I bought this a while back to have fresh bread ready when I wake up. Now, I use it at least once a week. I usually just use the mix, kneading setting but I have made meatloaf in this baby! I found a recipe where I can make pasta in the bread maker and can't wait to try that. Easy to clean, can back in maker, but I prefer shaping and baking dough in the over. Not one regret!
__label__1 Not so good: This has to be one of the worst of the Disney Cartoons. It was not a very smart movie it was ment for kids 3-6. That is about it. Many of the others are 'smart' cartoons that the whole family would enjoy. It felt very Warner Brothers.The issue I have is that Disney stated that no one was going to see the 'cartoon movies' anymore. That is only because they haven't written/drawn a 'smart' movie for a long time. People are looking for another Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan,and Little Mermaid. This movie doesn't match up to those.It feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. I was dissapointed and I am a HUGE Disney fan!
__label__2 gordon ramsay's cookware: Beautiful product and extremely well-packed. I always rest assured that anything I order from Amazon will arrive intact and whole. You all are superb!
__label__2 The Ultimate Game Man!!!: If you are just reciveing just Playstation or Playstation2 buy this game. It is the best car game you'll ever be able to buy. With an undercover mission you can get many cities throughout the USA. You start out with Miami and San Fransisco. Then as you beat more Undercover missions you'll soon get Los Angles and New York. The Missions get harder. But the hardest are at the end. You have a possible option to cheat and on the last phases you can't pass them without cheats.So buy this game for your own good.
__label__1 Poor Performance!: I registered for this monitor thinking it would be a great idea. No cords to plug in, so if I wanted to walk around with the monitor, I could hear it, and I could even have it in my pocket and feel it vibrate. But, it never worked right. I would have to fiddle with the volume to keep it from constantly fuzzing. The vibration was cool too, but that broke after about 6 months or so. I guess I just thought we would get what we paid for, but it doesn't always work like that. I know I won't buy another Fisher Price product again =(
__label__2 Lived up to expectations!: Yes it's true; after all these years, I'm finally reading the Harry Potter books, although we've seen the movies out thus far. Usually I prefer to read a book before seeing the movie based on it, but this way is great fun too, because the casting, costuming, and scenery of the movies seem so close to what Ms Rowling wrote that I can picture scenes from the movies as I read. Anyway, as with the first book, this one just sails along, with writing clearly geared toward children, yet still entertaining for us oldsters. I've got the next two out of the library and it's just about all I can do to keep going on the other book I've started in between and not throw it over so I can dig in to Prisoner of Azkaban! If you don't think you like to read, read these books, and you'll change your mind!
__label__2 As good as the book: John Ford is and deserves to be considered one of the finest directors of all time, and in Grapes of Wrath, he does not by any means dissapoint. The story's central character is Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) a prisoner who is let out of jail and finds him and his family gone, their land taken from them because of the Great Depression and the dust bowl. He finds them just as they're leavin' for California, the "land of dreams and honey", in order to find work.The movie not only tries to teach a lesson about history, but also tries to explain how the rich were predjuidiced against the poor. As we see the living conditions worsen, we begin to feel the strength that the people of that time had to have, and also feel the sorrow they felt when they were forced off of their land. One of the few movies that has lived up to the standards of a truly excellent book
__label__2 Great Bike!: This is a great bike and great value. It was fairly easy to assemble even though it ships without any directions (just a bunch of pamplets for individual features). I purchased the 19.5 inch frame model and had to adjust the seat down from it's factory setting (I'm about 5'10") but after that very comfortable ride. Very good quality construction. Love it.
__label__1 Okay: I've gotten this mouse twice, and found that both had the same problems after a month or two. They both would stop clicking (right or left). So I could scroll, but couldn't click on anything. At that point it's just useless. I ordered a second one of this model because I assumed that the problem was a fluke, but it turned out to be a consistent problem. It wasn't battery problems either; I would have the same problem with a fresh set of batteries.
__label__1 Seriously, Honeywell!? Styrofoam componentry & NO AIR FLOW!?: I have three other Honeywell air filters (I'll put in model numbers later - two of one model and one of another model) and they're all really very good. This one, however, mystifies me because the internal fan cowl is made of styrofoam, and not even high density styrofoam, it's similar to to what the unit came packed in for shipping. Even if that's acceptable on some deranged level of engineering logic (I'm sure management thinks this is just nifty) - the air flow from this thing is pitiful! The smallest honeywell unit I have pushes five times the output on high than this one does on high. This thing is going back, asap. On that note, thanks Amazon for making returns hassle free and easy!!UPDATE:I bought this one instead, it's been working great for 45 days straight on Medium or High.Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier
__label__2 My 7 y.o. loves it: I bought this for my 7 y.o., whose spelling skills lag her math/logic skills. I was looking for fun ways to practice spelling. She finds the game fun, and enjoys the challenge of the hard letter combinations that come up (though we added our own rule that we can "pass" if we both agree). I believe it does help reinforce spelling skills. However, the letter dispenser sometimes sticks, which is annoying. Tip: make sure you separate the letter tiles really carefully before you stack them--if they are stuck together, they will jam.
__label__2 Good deal: My Kid likes Barney and combo is cool. Very educational too. will buy more for sure. The cost is reasonable too.
__label__2 Better than nothing: This is a great product but be sure that the measurements are right for your car. I have an 2011 jeep grand cherokee and this was a little too big. However, the velcro part really stays put and it keeps my trunk well protected from my labrador.
__label__1 Tim Conway: We were disappointed with this dvd. We had not seen Tim Conway in anything other than the Carol Burnett Show and he iwas hilarious in their skits. Not so in this dvd.
__label__2 Enjoyed it: I liked this book although I've read some that seemed awfully similar before. The character development was very good and the interweaving of the Amish aspects made the book seem very rich. Overall I'd continue to read the series and I'm pleased that the author chose to include various issues that seemed quite un-Amish-like. It made the book seem more "real" and offered some growth producing conflict for the characters. Overall a good read!
__label__2 Elliott Goldenthal, John Cage: This eclectic CD is a must for fans of Elliott Goldenthal or John Cage. Additionally anyone who is plays in a brass qunintet or is intersted in brass quintet music should listen to this CD to expand their views of what a brass quintet can do in the comtemporary music landscape.
__label__2 Good book for Beginner Mac Users: I recently switched from a PC to an iBook notepad with OS X. So I was looking for any help I could get to teach me what I need to know. I checked out this book from the library and have found it extremely helpful. I don't think this book is aimed at "dummies" as another reviewer wrote, but at someone like myself who is just starting out with a Mac (and I don't consider myself a dummie). It is true that someone who is a "Power User" and has years of experience with Macs and the OS would find this book boring and talking down to them. But, if you're new to Macs at all, I think you'd find this book very helpful. It is a starter book, and from here, I would like to read other, more advanced books on the topic to further my knowledge.
__label__2 Great Product But...: This Product is great. Only issue is that it isn't Vista Compatible out of the box it takes some major digging on Microsoft's site to get the fingerprint reader to work
__label__1 Bob has more laughs than this: I've been a big Bob Newhart Show fan, and was left a bit disappointed at this box set. For me, the best of the six tapes was the last (season 6): "Ex Con Job" and "Happy Trails" (last episode). Many of the show's classic laughs are missing -- to start with, no Dr. Padvillion, no group cabin retreats and no Mr. Hurd!! Not a bad starter kit, but i'd guess the real enthusiasts would require more than this box set provides.
__label__1 Weight rating is misleading: I have used the Omnimounts twice: the system rated for 20 pounds, with 16-pound speakers; and the system rated for 10 pounds, with 7-pound speakers. In both cases, I tightened the ball joint as much as possible and the mounts still wouldn't hold the speaker in the desired position. In addition, the drywall mounts on the 10.0 failed completely, and the instructions are vague and not terribly helpful. Finally, the location of the Allen fastener for tightening the ball joint is all but inaccessible. I can't recommend this system.
__label__2 Could have been written by an eminent Victorian: I wouldn't exactly say this book is gripping or enthralling. Winchester writes with a kind of distant, haughty prose which comes across as rather ... Victorian. You'll be reaching for your own dictionary more than once as you read this book.Of course, this is entirely appropriate considering the subject matter. Winchester could practically be "channeling" Professor Murray himself. The book is full of heavily researched footnotes and asides. More than once I imagined it must have taken the author a week to get the facts for a single tangential sentence.But it all goes down easy thanks to his good sense of humor. There's a lot here for word lovers, of course, but also for those with a casual interest in Victorian intellectual society.
__label__2 WORTH EVERY PENNY - YEARS OF PLAY: We own both this Geometry set and its companion Architecture set and have for over a year loved these blocks! They've become slides and forts and tunnels. Wonderful, open-ended play that started with just toddling and crawling and now is a play "house" ...I have watched 3 kids 1-3 years old be entertained for over an hour. Top that! And the school-quality makes me think I'll have these for years more.
__label__1 Very little from the book: I wanted to watch the movie after starting reading the book Confession of a Shopoholic. Unfortunately, like any other adoptation, the movie has little common with the book. Too much changes and deviations. The Becky - is not how I pictured her reading the book. I regret to pay $2 for wasted hour.
__label__2 No hassle set-up: This thing 'pretty much' sets itself up on your existing home network. It was worth the extra 40-50 bucks to get this one rather then monkey rig some other wireless connector.
__label__1 Way too small for the Cingular 8525: The case is well made, has the holes to access functions in more or less the right places, and the picture on the packaging even looks like my phone. But there is no way to put a Cingular 8525 in this case without damaging either the case or the phone. If the Bodyglove case I had previously had been made of these materials it would have been perfect, but unfortunately it stretched to where it is no longer secure. This case just simply will not fit my phone. I sure wish the review saying this had appeared before I ordered mine. I'm going to try to return it and hopefully the seller will have some ethics.Bottom line, don't buy this case!
__label__2 Nice Product: It's a recovery strap that looks good under my seat in the truck, Have not used the strap yet, Stay posted........
__label__1 Highly Disappointing: This is turning into one of Sting's biggest (and longest enduring) commercial successes and its hard to imagine a less worthy candidate among his output spanning more than twenty years. While some have claimed it improves with repeated listening, I've reached the end of my rope in giving it a chance to take hold.The diverse musical influences and contrived eclecticism that are Sting's latter-day trademark now leave me longing for the golden thread that wound through his earlier career (think "Synchronicity" + 6 years) and entrenched him as the thinking man's megastar.While it's still comforting to hear him in new material, I can't help detecting signs of rot. A new Sting record should be an occasion for celebration, not a kicking-off point for another morbid discussion about pop music dinosaurs.
__label__1 Ho-hum(yawn): This is the most boring book I have read this year. You can easily read every third page (just so you don't feel guilty for spending the money)and greatfully get to the end in an hour.
__label__2 Captain Underpants: This is a book about two boys that always get in trouble George and Harold. A evil professor shrinks the school with a shrink ray and makes them change there names but Captain Underpants is there.So Captain Underpants beats the professor and saves the day.This book is very funny when they change there names
__label__1 Do Not Last: Like many others have pointed out, this item has some serious design flaws. After about a couple of months one of the earphones stopped working. I bought about three of these, thinking that the problem was due to an improper handling on my part. Same thing happened to all of them. A lot of Amazon reviewers have pointed out the same thing.On the positive note - they are very comfortable and provide a decent sound for the price. You will just have to buy a new pair every three months.
__label__1 Do not buy!: I bought this program and was very excited to use it on my mac........... In the first day at least 10 times in the middle of a project it would shut down(error msg) what a waste I even attempted to re-instal it with no change!!!!
__label__1 This is not a Nietzsche book!: Think about this, if you want to read "The Will To Power": This book is simply a compilation of unused Nietzsche writings done by the philosopher's sister Elisabeth Nietzsche and former intimus Peter Gast. They wanted to transform him into a nationalist, militarist and racist to get more publicity for him. So they falsificated many of his aphorisms he did during 1886 to 1888. This book and ONLY this book made it possible for Nazis to abuse him, the anti-nationalist, the philosemetic and anti-biologist.- Be careful with this book. I agree, it is sad that Nietzsche didn't leave a real "master work", so there is only one solution: Read ALL his books, starting with "The Birth Of Tragedy", finishing with "Ecce Homo". So you can get all the changes and the whole development in his philosophy. So all together, all his books summa sumaris are his "master work"!
__label__1 Nothing special: A decent sock but not very durable and after merely 5 or 6 washes, it started to lose it's ability to stay up high on the calf. I'd recommend buying something else.
__label__2 mr christmas light/music: If it was dark i'd make a video! It is spectacular. Cars slowin down or stopping to watch & listen to my display. My daycare kids LOVE it and so do i! Fantastic! As always, my dealings with Amazon are easy, quick, and top quality!
__label__2 Holiday for the Senses: Think of a small jazz club in Greenwich Village...dark, hazy with yesterday's smoke. Muscians mellowing out in the wee hours and then a seductive voice rolling on the waves of cool and sensuous lyrics reminiscent of Chet Baker and Jobim. Ever so cool...lyrical...enticing. The listener is sure to be emerged in forgotten passions, Mike Ferro is an old world muscian who brings warmth and exuberance to the lyrics. DJANGO is a must have for jazz lovers it really is a musical holiday for the senses!
__label__1 Muted Music Track: Image Entertainment has done an overall mediocre job on "The Bicycle Thief DVD." On the one hand, the video is excellent: crisp, sharp, a pleasure to behold.On the other, the audio has muted music, diffuse and dull throughout. The memorable, classic film score is rendered a serious blow here. Whereas dialoge is clear and full, the music, so important to this film, is actully of poor quality.To test what could have been, click on the trailer and note the fullness of the score. That's what should have been the case for the film.The overall rating of Image Entertainment's work here is below average. How unfortunate to ruin this great classic.
__label__2 Delicious: This album is overwhelming, absorbing, lush, idiosyncratic, difficult, gorgeous. The guy has chutzpah putting an album like this together. He's so unabashedly daring in sampling from musical resources dating from 1803 to 2003. Who does that now-a-days?! Granted, his over-the-top style can be hard to take if you are a meat and potatoes kind of music fan. But if you've ever loved the excesses of say, Terry Gilliam, the Beatles White Album, classical impressionist musicians such as Ravel and Debussy, and early '70s Frank Sinatra, hey, you may enjoy this album. This is an album of excess. It's indulgent. Some of the above reviewers have criticized it for being inaccessible. Who cares if not everyone gets it? There is too much accessible music out there--let's have something that enhances our artistic sensibilities; that challenges us. PS-- If you've ever lived in or near the Lower East Side in Manhattan, you know where he's coming from.
__label__2 Very good read!: I own a copy of this out of print book, which was brand new, never read or used before I got it. It was published by the JC Blair Co. in Huntingdon, PA, which is no longer in business. It contains historical fact of the Native American presence in the area before the settling of the Europeans here. This book was/is a souvenir book from the actual ceremony and only had one printing.
__label__1 Fair: A relative multitude of storylines and a colorful backdrop are almost enough to save "Vodka" from being what it is, another generic entry in the commercial thriller/intrigue genre.
__label__1 13 Ghosts................: So-so movie. It has it's good parts along with some boring parts but overall, good special effects with the ghosts. There were bloody parts in this movie making it more enjoyable to watch. When a very rich man dies and leaves his state of the art home to his nephew, he moves in with his family only to find out that there are things in the house that he was not aware of............. many ghosts. Just a OK movie.
__label__1 A total waste of money: The idea behind the book is simple: test many different methods over the course of ~43 years. Why do some work? He doesn't explain. No theory is presented, no ideas, strategies, or anything that might help a person. In general the book is one very big spread sheet that could have fit into a 5 page pamphlet. If you want to look at lists and lists of data stating how (for example) low P/E's performed over the years, then this is it. If you want to gain something from reading a book, then it's an expensive coaster.
__label__1 Not in typical Francine fashion: Francine Rivers is an amazing writer. For those who have not, you must readRedeeming Love and the Mark of the Lion series. That said, Leota' Garden did disappoint. I agree that it was unbelievably slow (I contemplated stopping prior to completion) and quite redundant. But, I'll give Francine Rivers a break...not every book can be a masterpiece.
__label__1 Waste of money: What a disappointment. I have old versions of songs off this cd before they decided to rerecord the entire thing. This cd would be a waste of $15 and hours of my time. Maybe you guys should look into old Underoath. Especially all of you "nerds" that are in love with the DVD that probably have no clue about the old heavier side of Underoath. You probably wouldn't like it anyway though, because it's not screamo. So nevermind.
__label__2 Blast from the past: I read this book a long time ago and forgot most of it. It is a fun read, and I enjoyed it very much.
__label__1 worst movie: Never saw a movie with Merly Streep I didn't like ---guess what this is the worst movie I ever saw
__label__1 Don't buy these: I bought a set of these for my 2005 Subaru Outback. They lasted for 4 months/6000 miles before needing to be replaced. From my home in the mountains, I drive up and down a somewhat winding paved road and normally get about 14 months of life from any tires, but this was ridiculous! I have never had tires perform so poorly in my life. Maybe without the mountain driving, they'd be better, but I'd be careful before buying these.
__label__1 Spare Me: If you want to read about wolves and the wolf recovery effort, read Barry Lopez or one of the other experts Evans credits. If you want to read about real evil and human/wildlife conflict with all of the complexities, heartbreak, and enigma this presents, read Cormac McCarthy. If you want to read something by a good writer who just wants to sell books, read this. Soap Opera. Very disappointing. Couldn't even finish it.
__label__1 Napoli Chips Dont Buy It!: We purchased Pfaltzgraff Napoli Dinnerware over a year ago. It was the worst mistake we ever made. We have always had fpaltzgraff dinnerware and we loved it. But this Napoli is worthless, almost every plate and bowl has a chip in it. We never had this problem before. Call to Pfaltzgraff were met by them as too bad for you. We should have known something was wrong when we saw on the bottom of the dishes they were made in China. There is no qualty, it all just junk from China.
__label__2 Wonderful: The headset arrive sooner then I expected. Works great with my phone. Would recommand this to anyone. The only thing that you need to get used to is wearing it on your ear. It is like wearing glasses for the first time. Just make sure that before you buy this or any bluetooth headset that it will work with the phone that you have.
__label__2 fran......... you're the best !: i cant wait to read this book , i love fran drescher and always expect the best from her and since she always gives us her best i know the book is gonna be wonderful, i've been waiting for the chance to buy it one year! and thank god i finally did i just hope it doesn't take to long because after all this all i can say "thank you so much fran for all the good times you have given us and don't forget we love you." you have to read this book i know is gonna be great! and do like i do :always expect the best from fran the colombian frannyfan maria.... . the book's great! (claudia)
__label__1 no max comfort here: Got this seat to replace schwinn stock seat. I think the stock seat was more comfortable! Dont waste your money! Im still searching for a comfortable alternative.
__label__1 Dry and sloppy: One of the worst put together book Ive read yet. Very subtle in its twisted attempt to mock a very fruitful ministry. Evidently the author has some sort of a personal grudge against this ministry and therefore has done everything he can to degrade it. Using concocted hearsay he makes an attempt to justify his railings. Remember that those who throw stones ....
__label__1 I wish I can give it 0 stars!!!!!: This movie stinks! The babies voices are so annoying! The plot was so bad, a bunch of kids getting lost in the forest. It was so overdramatic too. Tommy screaming for his mommy. BOO-HOO. This movie is a big flop and should have never been made.
__label__2 SEXY!!!!!!!: USHER REALLY PROVES HIMSELF AS A SINGER, A 14 YEAR OLD SINGER. HIS FIRST CD REALLY EXPRESSED HIS VOICE OUT AND I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN MORE PROPS FOR IT.
__label__1 Pure scam artist: Guys, do yourself a favor, just research on the net on him and his stupid GlobalTec and 4XMadeEasy firm.. It's crap. I'm a professional currency trader and everything from his firm to this book to his stupid JAME S DICK magazine is so superficial that even a junior high kid can write them. I can just work with a 15 year old to write something like that for one month and produce something similar. It's so sickening stupid that I feel sick and disgusted.. even the guy looks like a dick. If there is no star rating.. that is my rating for him.. 1 star is an overstatement already.
__label__2 This gadget is useful: If you are tired of your GPS popping off the windshield, this is the solution. Drop it on your dash and it stays there. Not cheap and not beautiful but functional and it fills the gap caused by carmakers failing to provide ways to attach today's popular accessories, such as GPS, Ipods, MP3s, cell phones, etc. My one quibble is that in deep, angled dashboard corners, such as the one in my vehicle, the device can get pressed against the windshield, where it can clatter and be difficult to reach the switch. You also may have to work around vents. But, hey, I don't have a GPS falling in my lap constantly while I'm driving down the interstate.
__label__1 very weak: steal my sunshine is catchy in a don't you want me baby kind of way.the big hit for the Human League.but after that this record is junk.this is lame.
__label__2 Surprised: I also have their other 2 albums - they are ok - but not great. So I did not expect to much from this one - but I was wrong - this is an incredible album. The last two tracks are my favourites. Sounds like bands like "Dark Moore" and "Heavenly" - melodic speed metal but not double base all the time - a bit of variation - and that makes this album great, If you want to buy a Domine CD - this is the one.
__label__2 Best lube on the markte: This lube is long lasting and feels great.this lube feels really "smooth" I dont know what other word to use. Have tried many other lubes and this is our favorite.
__label__2 Jake's tile: I bought this for my grandson--he loved it. He made his "own" stepping stone for his mother's garden. Like he said, "it's beautiful".
__label__2 I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!: THIS WAS THE FIRST LOI DUNCAN BOOK I EVER READ! MY BEST FRIEND LENT IT TO ME. NOW I'M GLAD SHE DID LEND IT TO ME! I WASN'T THAT BIG A MYSTERY FAN UTIL I READ THIS BOOK. IT WAS VERY SUSPENSEFUL. IT KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT. THE SCARIEST PART(I THOUGHT) WAS WHEN MIKE VAMP'S FACE APPEARED IN THE WIDOW OF APRIL'S HOUSE. THAT WAS FREAKY!!!
__label__2 Very original: Very original story and well-acted. The filming itself was just fantastic and added a high level of suspense to some scenes.Denzel Washington plays a quadriplegic ex-detective who's been asked by the local police to help solve a case of complicated serial killings. A young female street cop (Angelina Jolie) catches his eye for having a knack for forensics, so he convinces her to assist him in the case. Queen Latifah plays his live-in nurse and is superb. She continues to be one of the most underrated actors around.Everything was well-done in the movie, and it's hard to find any weaknesses. The ONLY weakness is miscasting of Jolie. Although she does a fine job, her physique and personality don't match the desired traits of the character. In this instance, they were obviously looking more for a pretty face than for someone who actually fit the bill. Queen Latifah may have served better for this role. It's still a great film.
__label__2 Walking the World's Most Exceptional Trails: I purchased this book for my husband who loved it. He is trying to plan our next 5 vacations. The pictures and locations are truly exceptional.
__label__1 la peor inversion: yo no creo que sea que no lo se usar, pero es el peor sistema del mundo para un lipstick, la primera vez que lo use me sabia a marcador y que te digo de la segunda si despues no lo pude usar mas? no salia nada, estaba completamente seco, de verdad es lo peor que he comprado
__label__1 Waste of time. The most boring film of alltime: Typically I like these kinds of movies. With so many oscar nominations and wins, I really looked forward to this movie. However I was greeted by an utterly boring movie. The plot was slow, the movie just sludged along at an overly-leisurly pace. And plot? What plot? You wait for the entire movie for something to happen and when it does, the movie ends a few minutes later. I think that the oscar judges fell asleep when watching this movie; when they woke up and the movie was over, they couldn't remember whether they liked it and so decided to be on the safe side, save some shame, and award this movie.Never again will those precious minutes of my life come back.
__label__1 Poor Quality: It looks like and does have everything I need for my variety of guns. However the larger of the rods broke the first time I used it and the smaller rod for the 17 caliber is near breaking. I have already replaced the larger rod with a kleenbore that is really nice and durable but it does not work with any of the "universal" attachments in this set. I would not recommend this set unless you want to buy a more durable set of rods, I guess with the same brand to ensure it works with the attachments.
__label__2 Like it a lot: I use this product to refresh our stained concrete floors. Although it's a little hard to find a good rag to use when applying it (thus the 4 stars), it really does the job. And it eventually wears off with regular washing, so there's no need to strip the old wax off before reapplying.
__label__2 A Jolly Holiday: This is a great gift for my family and friends. I think the humor and sensitivity of the season is right on. Its a colorful friendly way to let someone know they are a special friend. I am sure it will be read year after year.
__label__1 NO STRAWS!: I don't particularly like the taste of coconut water, but I use it in my protein shakes for extra hydration and minerals instead of water. If you want to take these individual servings with you, beware... There were NO STRAWS attached to the drinks, nor were they in the box. Not sure how you are expected to drink from it. Heads up!
__label__1 Ehhhhh: Just about useless. Buy easy peel oranges instead. This was not a helpful product for me. Bla bla bla bla
__label__2 Nice read: This was the first ever book that i had read, when i first got my kindle. To put it simply it a good nice read. The story line is nice the characters are well developed and have strong qualities. Really theres nothing i could put in words what this book mad me feel. Thats what i look for in a good book. How the story makes me feel how the characters an i respond emotionally towards on an other. When i read i feel as i the story comes to life. And thats what i got out of this book the story came to life so freely and beautifully and th characters showed so muh emotian so much heart that what really made it special. So do yourself a favor and read this book
__label__2 One of the greatest, if not The Greatest bass players of our time: Dario Deidda is one of the best bass players, ever. That's enough said. It's unfortunate that he is not as well known as he deserves to be. As many Italian musicians, he is one of those rare pearls known mostly by other professional musicians. I just hope that the international community will start giving Dario more opportunities to showcase his talent. He would challenge the best US bass players for sure.Damiano Fusco, November 2005
__label__1 Handle came out...: As mentioned in other reviews it just doesn't work on surfaces like pavement, roads and even inside home on tiles... and the handle came out after few months.
__label__1 this thing blows!!!: This thing blows!!! - Crappy production, not funny, and a bad attempt at copying a good idea.- damn it don't get much worse than this piece of junk. York needs to stick to those cheap and grimey street gang flicks they have been putting out and leave the comedy and kung fu to people who know how to get down. Take a pass on this joint big time, and pick up "Kung Faux : Volume 1" on dvd if you want the real deal.
__label__1 Not such a good experience: When I received the straightener, it didn't even work. Last time I spend that much money on something over the internet. I didn't even get my money back for the money that it cost me to send the straightener back.
