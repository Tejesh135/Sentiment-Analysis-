__label__1 Dull and depressing: The first few chapters of this book were encouraging, but somewhere in the middle the story just fell apart. I was expecting Ilana's life to unfold into a tale of adventure consistent with her youthful ambition, but as soon as she moves to the city, she loses all her spark and likeability and becomes a closed-minded old hag.Her daughters and their daughters are not much better. Their characters are boring, one-dimensional, and unlikeable. There is nothing interesting about their life stories or the depressing tenement in which they live.I forced myself to finish the book, hoping that one or more of them would get a life sooner or later and the energy of the earlier chapters would reappear. It never did.
__label__1 AVERAGE B MOVIE: I have just watched this -about 9 years after the rest of the world.I wish I had not wasted 2 hours.It is so poor that it could only frighten a child.It 's plot is so overdone that you get never get involved in it.Its got all the excesses of a gory comic strip.Anyone who never worked out after 2 seconds that Hannibal was in the ambulance is easily duped. Its a piece of trash for people who like trash but dont expect to be impressed.
__label__1 Made for kids who know long words....: I watched this with my little sister, and neither of us were impressed. It didn't tell us much of anything, acting like it was really cool. It seemed like it was made for kids (ones, my sister points out, who know some long words), and the quality almost indicated it was made BY kids. The commentator is a young girl who's not much of an actress, and sounds too excited for things not that exciting.Eyewitness videos are much more entertaining and informative.
__label__1 Not what expected!: Have read books much better than this video. Not enough variety and could have been much more informative with various settings.
__label__2 Thank you: This product works best for my system. I'm glad I purchased it. Thank you for this product, it helps in my over all health. I hope every one learns to take better care of themselves without being made to feel as though they shouldn't or that they are being to vain or selfish. Nonsense. God wants all of us to enjoy being healthy.
__label__2 Loved it!: One of my all time favorites! I love this book, found it very well written and it is truly a remarkable story. Highly recommend it!
__label__2 A little different: Great entertainment from a special guy. The dances are not done in the standard American Ballroom style, but I got some ideas from them. Considering the low price I am glad I bought it. If you want to learn to dance from the beginning, get something else.
__label__1 Troma would've done a better job: I am being generous with this 1 star. That's merely for the special effects and good opening scene.However, after that it all boils down to almost 2 hours of boredom. The action is bland and all has been done before. The acting and script, if you can call it that, is so plain and painfull. The talent that is there is completely wasted on this follow up.Troma studios would've done a better job than this.Not worth buying, only viewable if you are completely and utterly bored and there is nothing left on the shelves of your local video store.
__label__1 Nothing but problems: I can't print more than 10 pages before the printer has a "fuser unit failure" and has to sit for fifteen minutes before it will reset. This has happened 3 times so far and I am still waiting for the printer to reset as we speak. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this piece of junk.
__label__2 Satisfied: It's simple to use since it has no pump. I made copies of the sheet showing dates, time and results. My only negative is that instead of being able to keep it straight, the tube curves which might affect the outcome. But then the base would be out of reach!
__label__1 It's AWFUL.... I LOVED It!: This was by far the WORST movie I've ever seen, including anything by Ed Wood! Boobs, women in leather skirts, bad puns, a leopard in a corn feild and Bill Mahr as Jim! A must-see. Really. Would I lie to you?
__label__1 Poor world: As far as I know a high IQ has never prevented anyone to rot under ground after death. Call it the great (and eternal) nothingness curve. So, just be a good person and be of some help to the people around you! World needs love not pedantic morons. Of that sort we have more than enough, dont you think?
__label__1 Corny as a bowl of mush: If there's a southern man as head-in-the-clouds romantic as the hero of this book I'll eat my straw hat. Most of this book is dripping with descriptions of the mind-boggling "beauty and strength" of the heroine. She's beautiful this way, and also that way, on and on and on and on. Author obviously hasn't spent any time around the southern volunteer fireman I know.
__label__1 Exploitation turned into chick flick: A film about bourgoise aging Europeans using their wealth and power to have sex with semi-literate, uneducated poverty stricken third world locals? Surely a lengthy diatrabe against the sex tourism industry and a call to arms for the strengthing of the law against such evil predators? No, this film glosses over any issues of exploitation and abuse and tries in fact to be more of a romantic chick flick. Then surely this film must have caused howls of outrage upon release, pickets outside of cinemas etc? No, calm down everybody, this is the story of 3 aging white women who go to Haiti to take advantage of the bodies of poverty stricken, uneducated third world black men, and hence its perfectly fine, in fact a touching portrayal of the angst ridden lonely white middle-aged Europen female, who are tragically discovering that all the best black bodies in Europe are having sex with the younger, fitter white girls.
__label__2 I'm actually 13: YES! This was--in my opinion--the best Harry Potter book yet! J.K., where DO you get your material?! Harry Potter is like a Bible to me, and I am the Harry Potter priestess! This is the best Harry book of them all!Note: Some wonder who "R.A.B." (read the whole book to find out) is but I think it is Sirius's younger brother:Regulus A. Black.SO THERE! :)
__label__2 Laugh Out Loud Fun!: This is the first book in the Passport to Peril Mysteries. This story is about the tour from hell to Switzerland, as taken by Emily and her grandmother. Did I mention that included on this trip is a group of Nana's friends....senior citizens from Iowa? Everything that can go wrong does, and Emily finds herself overboard swimming to catch up to a floating artifical limb in one scene. Overall, there are just too many hilarious scenes in this book to describe them all but they do not disappoint!Secondary to the action (at least in my opinion) is the mystery of a fallen fellow traveler that, of course, Emily solves. I would compare this book to Janet Evanovich for humor and for the slapstick-type situations that both Stephanie Plum and Emily find themselves in.As of this writing, the second book in the series, Top O the Morning, is due to be released in September of 2003. Enjoy!
__label__1 Knee Highs Definitely Stay Up!!: These QUEEN size knee high nylons with cotton soles will DEFINITELY stay up for you...in fact, they will almost cut off your circulation. I bought them for my mother for a gift. She told me she couldn't use them as they were so tight, so she told me I could have them. I have the world's skinniest legs (literally NO calfs). That being said...these QUEEN size knee highs are so tight on my skinny legs that even I cannot wear them. They are so tight that they almost cut off my circulation and caused excruciating pain from the tightest band in the world at the top! It is too late to return these, or I would. Do NOT waste your money! The company needs to go back to the drawing board on this product!!
__label__2 Classic, Renault at her best: Read all of the Alexander series but was always partial to this one. My heart went out to Bagoas and his dedication to Alexander was exceptional. A great read.
__label__2 good quality: i wasn't sure how much i needed so i bought the 250 and now i have about a hundred feet left for future projects. seems to be good quality and i know about the company.
__label__1 Not Up to Other Horror Greats of His Era: This book put me to sleep every time I went to read it. I read dry histories without falling asleep. This is a mighty indictment from me.
__label__1 I want to like it, but...: All three Buster Bros. games, Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo and Block Block. They're all great games, but unfortunately they're almost impossible to enjoy; the game has serious problems with the PSP's firmware updates. After updating to 3.52, Puzzle Fighter would shut down my PSP at seemingly random intervals, and Buster Bros. refused to start at all; the game would just freeze at the loading screen. Things only got worse when I downloaded 3.71 - attempting to quit out of any of the games just hangs it at the loading screen. I couldn't even quit back to the PSP's menu via the Home key as the system would simply freeze.So while this is a great collection of games, it doesn't make a bit of difference if you can't even play them reliably. I can't recommend this one.
__label__1 Dissapointing movie: Being a big fan of zombie movies I thought I'd give this a try. It was ok but I couldn't get through the whole movie. There was just no interest in the lame plot or the unexciting characters.
__label__2 Very good book. Kindle images not so good.: This is a great, very consistent book about accounting. The example transactions are very nice, author shows a great understanting regarding subject and explains really well.My only complain is about Kindle version: when I read this book on Kindle DX several images don't have a good resolution, they are blur. Except this minor issue, I recommend this book to everyone interested on Financial Statements: if you want to learn about accounting, be a better investor or in your own business.
__label__2 A great film: Another one of the movies of 1999, that didnt get as many hailed reviews as it should have. This was truly the scariest movie that I have ever seen. I personally thought that it was scarier than The Exorcist, well, it was certainly freakier than The Exorcist. Kevin Bacon is a superb actor, and he did great it this film. Zachary David Cope, Tom's son, was also great. I would have to say that the hypnotic scenes were the most impressive thing. That and "the feathers" - that just really freaked me out, the way he predicted that. The Film was overall great, and you should really take your time, rent the video, then buy it because you'll certainly want to watch it again!
__label__2 Got a replacement fairly fast: The first one I got was obviously used...but I got a replacement pretty quickly.Thanks for the fast service
__label__2 An American masterpiece of energy & youthful mania: Almost fifty years ago now, Jack Kerouac decided to tape together a bunch of sheets of paper to form an endless scroll he could feed through his typewriter, so that he would be able to keep writing his story without having to change sheets or even look up. The result is an American masterpiece of energy and youthful mania as Sal Paradise and his friends criss-cross the continent in search of kicks. It's very difficult for an author to capture a moment in time with precision, but Kerouac does more than that: he captures what it is to be young and striving for the open road, to see new things, to gather new experiences. That's why this book is still so appealing. The only comparable book for today's On the Road fan is Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf. It's also a great book of youth, funnier than On the Road, but it remains to be seen whether it will also stand the test of time as On the Road has so well.
__label__1 What a rp-off: This box set boasts over fifty performances, ON FIVE DVDS... You do the math. This had the potential to be really something special. Five dvds worth of music should be at least fifteen hours of fun. Instead you get one dvd worth of music spread over five for over fifty bucks.Buy something else...
__label__2 Great slippers!: These slippers were for my husband's birthday. He has a narrow foot so the fact that he could tighten the laces made them a good fit for him. He loves them and wears them more than he has ever worn a slipper. In fact, this pair was the second pair I have bought him. They are very comfortable and the fact that he can wear them outside as well is an added bonus.
__label__2 This fit really good: This fit the humidifier really well. I was pleased to find a replacement as the one I had was falling apart. I can't seem to find a replacement in the stores.
__label__2 A Must Read For Those Interested In Civil Rights: This book surpassed my expectations. It is the personal account of Dr. King's life. What I liked most about this book was that it really showed the emotion and the thought that went into the protests that King was involved in. I could feel his fear for his life and his family as the Montgomery Bus Boycott began. I could feel his doubt about his actions. I have read a lot about civil rights, but this book made that era real to me.
__label__2 LOVE IT!!!!: I bought this sleeping bag two years ago and it is by far the most comfortable sleepong bag I've ever used. I'm 5'5" and didn't realize it was so big, but it worked out well when we went camping and I was 32 weeks pregnant. Mummy bags are too restirctive and nylon bags feel like a trash bag to me. I will use this bag until it is in pieces.
__label__1 Made Only $17,000 in Theaters for a Reason: What speaks volumes about the overall quality of this movie is that it was released in only half a dozen movie theaters nationwide, and grossed less than 20k at the box office.At best it's an average movie with no quality acting, which reflects the fact that only 5% of voters on Rotten Tomatoes actually enjoyed it. The complications that arise with our main character as the movie progresses are predictable, as is the "twist" that occurs at the film's conclusion.The biggest mystery of this film is how they were able to land Michael Douglas on the cast. Douglas has virtually no real screen time in this movie, which is a major disappointment for those of us who enjoyed his work in movies like King of California, Wall Street and Basic Instinct. No need to wait for the jury to return to the courtoom; my verdict is that it's not worth even a Redbox rental.
__label__2 Where is Liu Kang????: I've always loved Mortal Kombat. It is easily the most violent video game there is. Then I saw the movies. Those were awesome. Low budget, made for men, and a crap load of action. Then I bought this book. The book itself is a very good book. It is very neat to hear the story of how Mortal Kombat was created. But there was one question I had during the entire book: Where is Liu Kang? The book follows the story on Kung Lao(you know, the guy with the hat) instead of Liu Kang? Kung Lao is cool, but I was very disappointed. So don't think the book is bad, because it's not. But Jeff Rovin(the author) got some things wrong with the characters. So just keep this in mind.
__label__2 Great read for teens and adults: Maggie Rose and Sass is a thought-provoking journey of two adolescent girls from vastly different cultures. We rejoice as the girls conquer their fears and become friends, realizing that they are more alike than different. Both teens and adults will enjoy this book, reminding us that cultural clashes are something we must all overcome. Learning about the real Kansas town the book is based upon is an added bonus.
__label__2 Content top-notch: The actual movie is excellent; the script and acting are phenomenal and the costumes and setting are historically accurate. However, the image quality is like that of a VHS tape...rather washed out and grainy. The "special features" are useless.
__label__2 A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes: Among the many works of Tibetan masters devoted to the three codes, none has enjoyed more notoriety than A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes by the celebrated author Saskya Pandita Kunga Gyaltshen (or Sapan, 1182-1251), presented here in a Western translation for the first time. Not so much a text on the content of the codes themselves as an examination of the many particular questions that relate to the codes - questions that Sapan saw as subject to misunderstanding on the part of his Tibetan contemporaries - The Three Codes has a strongly polemical character. Thus it is easy to see why some readers found the work objectionable in places, others praised it, and all have become fascinated by it. Few indigenous Tibetan writings have inspired so abundant and diverse a body of later-commentary, commentary that rivals even that on the great Indian Buddhust treatises in its extent.
__label__1 Not Suggested Reading Material: I must say, that out of my many years of training in martialarts, I have learned many techniques of killing. This book containsseveral more. I have trained in martial arts most of my life and have learned over 200 ways to kill a man with my bare hands, but, when I opened the cover of this book I was honestly disgusted. When you take this material in to serious concideration it is not a pleasant thought. If you want to learn to defend yourself, then buy the U.S. Marines Close-Quarters Combat Manual, but please, do not buy this book.
__label__2 Gauged Earrings: These are nice, but gauged larger than normal pierced earrings. They are too thick to go through the holes in my ears. I wouldn't have bought them if I had known.
__label__2 This is really a coolant temp sensor: Although the heading in the product listing states "oil pressure sensor" the part is, in reality, for the coolant sensor.Just what I needed. I would rather use factory *AC Delco* when available. The price was right and shipping was a snap. I am aware that AC Delco is a tad more expensive than after-market; however, in this case, the item is a direct fit.
__label__1 ...: Despite being so cheap, I found this overpriced ... it is merely a thin pamphlet comprised of 12 recipes for Christmas. That would have been fine, and I would have been delighted even at many times the price *IF* it had told anything about the recipes, how the family/friends enjoyed them, where the recipes came from, or even if the author had ever tasted them. But just a terse printing of 12 recipes w/o descriptions seems to be a complete waste of space. I was very disappointed; I had really been looking forward to this, mistakingly thinking that it would include brief descriptions and/or recollections. Instead, it didn't include either.
__label__2 Great Color: I will admit that I may have a secret love for office supplies. In a nutshell, here's what I thought of the Post-it Notes, assorted ultra colors pack.GOOD- nice color selection- colors tend to stay bright and vivid and don't fade- strong adhesive means you can move them around and they maintain their stickiness- unlike some of the other color packs, there's an even amount of each color in these packsBAD- pricey compared to the traditional Canary Yellow
__label__2 One of my cats learned how to use this!: Length:: 1:46 MinsOne of my cats learned to use the Kitty Kitchen treat machine within a week ... but 5 others never learned how! It's a real hoot watching her work the machine, see the video I've attached.
__label__1 no for everyone: I bought this intending to give it to older friends of mine so they chould fill it out for there kids and grand kids. But there are a LOT of sexual questions in there and things NO ONE needs to know about u.
__label__1 rip-off: The DVD basically uses Slipknot's name to show footage of Des Moines. There is no slipknot music or live footage, just some old stills that they repeat over and over again in between people talking about what it's like living there. It is NOT the dvd they have been plugging at their concerts that will feature live performances, interviews, etc....wait for that one, trust me.
__label__1 waste of money: I bought my first ipod 10 months ago. Toward the end, the battery life slowly got shorter and shorter, until finally it wouldn't even turn on. I called apple, and the said they would replace it for $30 shipping. Fair enough. I mailed the ipod to them, 5 days later, i got a "new" ipod. Opened the box, charged the player, and what do i see? The EXACT same error message! I called apple, VERY upset, and they informed me there was nothing they could do unless i purchased the "apple service care pack" for like $60!! I was irate!This product is worthless. Apple customer care is worthless. PLEASE do research before you purchase this product, there are many other better players, it's not worth it to be "in style". I had to learn the hard way.
__label__1 Overpriced coffee maker that will fail within 2-3 years: After two years, the plastic tab that locks in the filter basket broke, requiring tape or a rubber band to keep the filter basket in place. 6 months later, the small dome on the plastic lid broke, preventing the coffee from leaving the filter basket, so coffee and grounds overflow all over the counter. This coffee maker is classic "made in China" shoddiness.
__label__1 this book did NOT include the CD nor the map as stated: I ordered this book for a 6 weeks class I am taking and only ordered this one because it included the CD and the MAP that I needed. I could have ordered just the book for around $40, but I choose to pay the extra (almost to $90) because it this one SAID that it included the CD and the MAP - well guess what it didn't I was RIPPED off - the class is over a very short time period thus I have no time to return the book and get anotherBUYER BEWARE!!!!!
__label__2 Some of my favorite Christmas recordings...: My kids and I love this CD. It has our absolute favorite recording of Jingle Bells by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters. Also, the Winter Weather and Silver Bells recordings are awesome. Donna Fargo does a great rendition of Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree. A couple of the other songs are a little slow, but still nice. The Little Boy that Christmas Forgot is obviously an old recording, and so sad, but I love that one too. If you enjoy Christmas music like we do, and like to have several recordings of songs, this is a CD you should add to your collection.
__label__2 Grind and Brew: We had a Cuisinart "Grind and Brew" my wife loved, it did however break down three times with-in the warranty period. Cuisinart fixed or replaced it, but the shipping costs were an unexpected cost. She loved the product and its output so much I bought her a new one; however after receiving it we discovered a much cheaper local price.
__label__1 Retched Vile: This movie is popular for one reason-Rob Zombie directed it! That's it! It's not frightening, disturbing, humurous, or slightly entertaining. It's like a cross between Texas Chainsaw massacre and The People Under the Stairs. Rubbish!
__label__1 Racing on freeways, what fun is that?!: I thought this game deserves one star because the gameplay is fu***** cheap. The only race mode is race on the freeway, it gats real old, real fast. The only thing I find fun is the ways you can customize your car, but that is pretty much it.Also this game does not deserve to be $25, it should be free.
__label__2 Great book!: This is an awesome book. I bought it for my 6 year old son as he loves planes. What a hit, his older sister (8) loves the book too. Now I keep some on hand for Birthday gifts. I gave it to a 9 year old boy for his birthday and Wow what great response from him and the other kids. You just have to love when kids can make their own fun and not sit in front of a computer game! GREAT Book!
__label__2 THIS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.: Before reading this book, I lived with considerable back pain every day. When I was 24 I had surgery to fix 2 herniated discs and that started the belief that I had serious structural damage. I was told by many doctors that only through rigorous daily excercise and daily stretching will I reduce some of the pain. This went on for aproximately 16 years, then I read this book.I took about 3 weeks but I am now living without back pain for the first time in 16 years. READ THIS BOOK, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE. Keep an open mind and IT WILL WORK. Anyone that is not cured by this book is simply not able to accept the diagnosis. We've been trained to think that only surgery and pills remove pain and at the same time ignoring the most important organ in our body, our brain.I heard about this book and quickly dismissed it as holistic B.S. and laughed at anyone that thought back pain was created by their mind. I'm still lauphing now, just at myself for not reading this book sooner.
__label__1 Not what I expected: Ordered this to replace a similar 25 year old lamp. We didn't want to spend a lot but thought this might be a little better quality than the $50 Target or Walmart type. We were wrong. Lamp has a cheap looking finish with a cheap paper shade and the long stem is a two piece affair with a seam in the middle. Naturally it is made in China. Guess we should have known better than to buy something like this on line. The company, Lamps Plus, was good to work with and provided a refund with no problem but we were out the $30 parcel post shipping (FedX or UPS would have been $60)for the return. We'll end up going to a local lighting center and spending $500+ to get what we need.
__label__1 stopped working in two months: i had this delivered overnight and it worked fine for two months and then nothing waste of my money!!!!!
__label__1 Game is Terrible: After owning NBA live 05 and 06 this game is a huge dissappointment. I have never played 2k7 but I am considering purchasing it because this game is just terrible.
__label__1 eh: "Simple Abundance" is the one. Don't waste your money, this is watered down and not helpful. not much inspiration found, glad i didn't have to pay for shipping
__label__1 Our Town order completely screwed up: I ordered the book 'Our Town', and paid for express delivery. The book I got was the wrong one! The vendor says it's due to Amazon's order entry system. While they did refund everything I paid, including delivery, I still had to go elsewhere because they didn't have this book, and, worse, I lost a bunch of time in eventually getting this book.
__label__2 Great workout for someone on the go: Believe it or not, this was my first Denise Austin workout dvd. I was doing all the Leslie Sansone walk/jog/etc. workouts and needed a change. I love the fact that you can customize the workouts and do the warmup, cardio, cooldown; or the warmup, strength, cooldown; or the warmup, cardio, strength, cooldown; depending on how much time you have that day or what you want to concentrate on. The dance steps are a little tricky at first, but I got them on my 2nd try easily. I used 3 pound weights and that was perfect for the strength section. I really recommend this.
__label__2 Beautiful Film About the Right to Die: Javier Bardem stars as a man in the 90s who is trapped in his body after a catastrophic accident while diving in the sea. He lives many years with a family who cares for him very well. He dislikes a wheelchair and is not willing to live the life he has with his paralysis. He goes to court and with his loved ones and help from those who support his decision is allowed to do what he choses to do. The movie is a quiet gentle film that emphasizes the quality of life rather than the finality of death. Nice film.
__label__1 Fine unless you want to know your temperature: This thermometer does in fact come up with a temperature reading quickly. However, if you take your temperature several times in a row, you'll find that the reading changes constantly and significantly. My wife is sick right now, and at one time, she is getting readings ranging from 98.3 to 100.5. In other words, this is a useless product. Don't waste your money.
__label__1 Proprietary battery bad.: While the toy may be cool the "batteries not included" on the box is definitely deceptive. A $30 proprietary battery should be included with the toy and NOT a secondary expense.
__label__1 "Folding" is Pathetic: You fold this up and unless you have the case with you, you have 4 dangling posts about 8" long each going every which way. I am going to have to look for a product that folds into itself, telescope style - far, far more practical.
__label__1 Not working for me.: After a week my hair started to turn red.Not black,not gray...red.This forced me into a haircut,now looking for something else.
__label__2 OXO Good Grips 6-Piece Measuring Cup Set, Black: This is a great set that can be used not only at home kitchen but great to use at work. The measurements are acurate and they don't break.
__label__1 Nice book, but way too many typos: I love the 24 Hours of LeMans, and this is my first 'Official LeMans' book purchase. Whomever was the copy editor should be fired: too many weird/incomplete/runon sentences (some just make no sense at all), too many misspellings and lots of imcomplete information (example: drivers 'city' is not shown properly for some drivers).
__label__2 Fond Memories: This is probably my personal favorite of all their LPs together. The songs are light hearted and I love the cover photo.
__label__2 Toughest, truest flying disc: My dog has been through plenty of flying discs - I tried every single type available in the UK. Saw the reviews for this and paid an extraordingary amount to have it shipped over to the UK. Its def worth it - has lasted way longer than any other disc and flies truer and longer than other dog friendly discs. Thank you America! You can see my dog putting his Jawz through its paces here: [...]
__label__1 Not Happy: I would not recommend purchasing this. When I ordered this violin, I thought it was going to be great because I did a lot of research and this one had the best ratings and reviews. I was really excited when I got it, but as soon as i tried to tighten the strings on the bow, the bow snapped. Also the strings on the violin were out of tune, so I tried to tune it and then one of the pegs broke off. I waited 2 weeks for this violin and it ended up disappointing me greatly. I was not happy, so in the end I just ended up returning it, and renting a violin from a music store. Trust me, it's not worth the time or money you spend on it.
__label__2 Great Read: I very much enjoyed this read. She has many good points.Unfortunately, she does not understand the idea of ransom and original sin. This is something she will find out later. Most of the world also do not understand these concepts as they are only given to the Church. Read "The Divine Plan of the Ages" and especially the chapter "The Permission of Evil" for an explanation of why things are the way they are today, and why God does not yet step in.Her conclusions of what will happen with socialism are true, and we are headed that direction, but the Church are the ones under the ray protected area, planning for the life after the collapse.
__label__2 Educational and entertaining: I try to catch the show whenever I can. It's not that I am going to go out there in the wild anytime soon, but it never hurts to know these possible life saving tips. People complain about how the show is not 'real' enough. Now I ask these people who sit comfortably at home,'Even with all the help you ever need, are you able to scale those cliffs, swim across arctic water, and swallow the food that Bear puts in his mouth?' Bear is here to eduacate and also entertain us, and in my opinion he is doing a great job.
__label__1 a royal prankster sputing cheap pennyless acadmia: what can one expect from another literary critic except the self-inflation of oneself with large words full or nothingness and experience that resorts to shallow if any experience (see the boring book tv diatribe on cspan2 -11.24.2003) as he carefully dodges questions in some unmasterful measure. a continual examination in which nothingness (not in the sartrean sense) is exactly that. stick to the pros - chomsky or any philosopher worth his cred. postured and a wase of any ligitimate time.
__label__2 Correct Edition, Came brand new: Came brand new and very fast. Should help out for this coming semester and beyond for organic syntheis and problem solving
__label__2 The most exhilirating movie I've ever seen1: The Matriz is a non-stop ride. The way the effects moe smoothly across the screen and you can barely tell that they aren't real is amazing. This movie ranks up there with Star Wars as one of the best sci-fi movies of all time.
__label__1 Boring: This is the worst Steven Seagal movie ever. Story has been done before, create a super human soldier, and better. Looks like post production dubbed over Steven Seagal's voice numerous times.
__label__2 Reason Without Rhyme: 'Dreams in the Mirror: A Biography of E.E. Cummings' is a precise account of a unique, creative poet. Richard S. Kennedy has made sense of the seemingly incoherent mind that made the literary world spin in a profoundly deconstructed orbit during the period following Cummings' graduation from the Harvard School of Arts and Sciences in 1916. Perhaps the most significant element of Kennedy's book is the previously unpublished Cummings' poem discovered in the dusty closet of a Tunisian Bed&Beakfast he'd occupied in 1931. Titled 'Insanity is Just a Mind of State', it is one of Cummings' most autobiographical works, revealing the poet's life-long regret that he'd never wrestled an alligator. The lament, on page 79, reads:'i'm mad; say theybut Almonds aren't NUTS!(is) thE river SEINE in pariS;?'The human mind is a beautiful thing.
__label__2 Big Breakfast Is Now Easy: This is a lifesaver for big hearty breakfasts. It used to take a long time and a lot of pans over the whole stove to cook. Now I can do 6 pancakes at a time easy on this, and switch to eggs, bacon, and spam and get the whole thing done for everyone within 20 minutes... and only one pan to clean off. Only thing I would mention is the grease drain is small, and our stove isn't level, so it tends to pool at one end which can be messy. Other than that, it's great. And DO follow the instructions for how to clean.
__label__2 Very good learning tool: I think this book is great, my 5 year old daughter now knows all of the presidents by name and number! In fact I am buying another one beacause she has worn the one we have out, but insists that she needs one.
__label__2 good movie: one of disney's better productions for this day and age. glad we found it since our vhs was ruined; thank you
__label__2 13 years into their career, their masterpiece: The title above says it all. Anyone familiar with TBW knows that this is their pinnacle. For those unfamiliar, think "Mummer" era XTC, a quieter My Bloody Valentine, a more earthy New Order, or (as has been said before elsewhere), a sad Beatles! Quite simply, if you ever loved any of the above mentioned giants, or crave well-crafted, intelligent and melancholy pop (as I do), you need this album.
__label__2 Still Slammin... with the T.. the K .. the A: I think when I ordered this CD I wanted a CD full of Freestyle beats just like back in the day... But when I started to think about what I liked most about TKA it was the vocals... Yeah the music was slammin and that old Freestyle sound was great.. But these guys could sing... I would call myself a core fan I grew up on TKA then K7's CD but the bottom line is every artist/group has to grow.. And grow they did! WOW! I LOVE this new CD so much. It has the classic TKA vocals and great beats.. Some house, disco and even a little retro sounding freestyle and some nice ballads.. Give them a chance and grow with them..Ross Wilson
__label__2 Great gift: .This was a gift. The recipients were overjoyed with it and it was something that they really wanted. A home run.
__label__2 Grab this book while you can: Every crocheter should own a copy of this book. It is filled with just about every stitch you can imagine,which will help you to create your own designs.
__label__2 This writer: I love her books, fun to read. ....You require too much,I hate you requiring us to writeso many words
__label__2 Dont even read other reviews.: I would like to start off by saying that i had never watched the TV series, so when i watched Fire Walk With Me, i watched it without any expectations or knowledge of the series. Some may say that only people that watched the series know enough to evaluate the movie, but i say, i looked at it AS A MOVIE, and a movie only.Moving on, This movie kicked ass. The plot was great, the acting was great, the sountrack was great. There is a ton of symbolism and a great message in this movie. I watched it probably 5 more times and kept applying my own interpretations to it, and it is totally worth buying. Compared to the series, i dont really care how it is. Compared to other MOVIES, (which this is a movie), it is awesome. Get it.
__label__1 Not great, not great at all.: I bought this because it was cheap but in the end I payed the price for being cheap with myself. This product isn't even by Hori, at least the one I received wasn't from Hori. This thing leaves a messy stickiness on your screen that practically ruins it. I managed to get all the sticky off and all the residue from this garbage by using the cloth that came with it. The cloth ended up scratching my screen! I bought this with the intention to protect my screen instead this thing only did harm. I threw it out the same day I got it. Lesson learned! Stay away, stay far away!!! Run now before it's too late. My advice is, don't be a cheapskate and buy the better, albeit expensive, ones out there.
__label__1 Hard to relax to her robotic voice....: I found myself distracted by the robotic tone of her voice... I think the Cd would have been more beneficial with a more soothing, relaxed voice. Also, I liked the affirmations more than the visualization section. I'll probably try to listen to it again..I believe in the mechanics of it...
__label__2 Pretty good: The ear piece is comfy and I don't even notice I'm wearing it a lot of the time. My phone does voice recognition and 60% of the time the earpiece gets the name wrong, the actual phone never does. Also, when the battery only has about half the charge, it won't always pick up a call, I'm not sure why. But, it doesn't take batteries, it just charges on the smae charger I have for my phone so that's a big plus. My suggestion is to charge it every night. All in all, a pretty good ear piece!
__label__2 beautiful pictures: I married into a Persian family. I purchased this book so my husband and I could enjoy Persian food at home. I cannot wait to try the recipes. I had his sister audit some of the recipes and although slightly different, the recipes are similar to their family recipes.
__label__1 The tool is a joke: The Black & Decker battery powered adjustable wrench should be sold as a toy, not a tool. The wrench will not close tightly enough on a nut or bolt to keep from rounding it when dong real work. Even when manually tightened, it is so poorly made that it is still unusable. The concept of needing to push a button to use a wrench is misconceived at best. There is a real danger of leaving some skin behind when the wrench slips. Spend your money on a real wrench... they're cheaper and safer.
__label__2 Superb mix of global non secular musical denominations: I first heard Ms. Pook's music on the "Eyes Wide Shut" soundtrack (the masquerade ball scene) and was blown away; if ever there was a necessity for music to permeate a scene in a film this was it. She incorporates a blend of the traditional songs from faiths across continents and mixes them, for lack of a better comparison than similar to your quintessential raver d.j. (though these are better and definitively more original :) "Oppenheimer" is my favorite, and if you let the last track run for a few minutes a portion of the song will play once more. I can't wait to hear more of her stuff - these hymns are awesome.
__label__1 safety risks with kettle handle: Unlike other reviewers I liked the removable whistle maker on the spout--just remove it before you pick up the kettle handle. However, what troubled me was the continual loosening of the screws in the handle--one day I picked up the kettle and the handle started to come off the pot because the screw was loose!!! No matter how tightely we screwed the handle back on nor how many times we did so, it always started loosening itself immediately. Despite how much I liked the pot I had to throw it away.
__label__2 Kissin as a Pianist: Though Kissin is accomplished for his age, he is still a fledgling performer which was manifested in these performances. I do believe he gets progressively more profound in every release. However, Schubert's sublime masterpieces are a joy to listen to no matter who conveys them.
__label__2 Amazing: Amazing. Very sexy and exciting but not explicit and gratuitous. We meet Flora as a young lonely girl of ten on vacation with her selfish, neglectful parents. We follow her life as she matures to a beautiful woman. Three men love her but which does she love and which one will she choose. This is one book hard to put down.
__label__2 Very good camera!: I got this camera for use on vacation. It took such amazing pictures of the German countryside that we now use it as our main household camera. Connecting to your computer is incredibly simple, especially if you have Windows XP. You will probably want to purchase a larger memory card to go along with the 16 MB card that comes with it. It is very easy to use. My twelve year old niece began to take pictures without any training, and they turned out great. The movie function is great and I love the freedom of picture quality, flash, battery usage, etc. Overall this is a great camera for whoever wants to take great pictures.
__label__2 Max Payne.... Max Fun!: I am very picky when it comes to games. Ecspecially when you have a shoot-em up game because they tend to have little or no story (IE Quake 3). In my opinion a story makes the game by far. This game EASILY makes my grade. Like one reviewer wrote, this game has AWESOME graphics, AMAZING gameplay, and of course; a non-improvable story. Never before have I ever played a game with a plot more intriguing and yet the graphics and action make it even better. The Slowtime feature (enables you to be in slo-mo matrix style) NEVER gets old and is very useful for the game. Max's voice is a bit too much, very low and very deep, often times amusing. PARENTS WARNING: While this game IS fun it is also VERY violent I would not reccomend the game for people under 11 or so.Overall, this game is shaping up to be the action game of the year, if not overall best game of the year. Thinking about getting it? GET IT its totally worth it. TRUST ME.
__label__2 Terrific Music, Not a Great Value: The Emerson String Quartet is one of the most successful andpopular chamber groups of the 90s. While this recording may notreceive as much critical acclaim as their Bartok, Schubert or Shostakovich recordings, these Mozart "Haydn" Quartets are played dynamically. My only reason for not awarding a fifth star has nothing to do with the content of the music, but instead with the value of this purchase. Many prospective buyers may want to opt for the Julliard String Quartet's 3CD "Haydn" Quartet performance. With this CD you get two pieces, whereas with the Julliard you get 6. However, with either choice you are getting terrific music.
__label__2 The Devil's Cub and other Georgette Heyer books: This review is for all of the literary snobs out there. Get off of your high horse and try these amazingly funny books. The fact that these books have a much higher vocabulary level than most books of today may help soothe your erudite qualms. Georgette Heyer's regency romance books, which are the prequel to the Harlequin Romances, are several cuts above today's smarmy love stories. While the plot of these stories always hinges on a romantic situation, it is the witty and humorous dialog that makes these books the treasures that they are. They are all light, funny and satisfying reads but "The Devil's Cub is one of Heyer's best.
__label__1 too heavy...didnt work......: these 'snakes' are tough for the average drill to bite into and hold while pushing it through a small drain.plus thething is made too thick for average home-owners or apt owner's drain opening. while it does go in, its tough for the average drill and arm-strength to push it through.AND not drill through your pipes!get this....directions say to disconnect and/or unscrew your drain pipe! can you imagine? why not just call a plumber in the first place...whole idea was NOT to call a plumber......also water can get into your drill as you work (ha ha! just you try it!) this thing in. not good to get electrocuted!lastly, the one's that plumbers use are the only one's that work.i finally used drain opener - follow all directions. for [...] bucks at the hardware store why bother with these snakes? they are good only on tv shows or the zoo!lou
__label__1 Band Won't Last: The watch is nice and works fine, but the rubber band turned a dark brown within 3 months of purchase, had to buy a new leather band--- no reason to buy this watch
__label__2 This Is TRUELY a Great GREAT great CD: Michelle branch is advancing as an artist, are you happy now? is the best song i've heard, (ever)if you like people like 'britney' and 'hilary' than NO you will not like her but if you like people like the dixie chicks and vanessa carlton than yes she rocks. (i'm not saying she sounds alot like dixie chicks and carlton but they are songwriters doing what they want in music, people like britney and hilary duff are not.)I would DEFINITLEY reccomend this cd, If you want something to sing along to or to play along to or to just listen to than THIS is YOUR CD.
__label__1 why do people like this game?: This is the biggest disappointment I've had in purchasing a game in years. This game has such high acclaims, but lives up to none. The graphics are poor, and the game play is dull. The real-time battle scenes reminded me of the Blue and the Gray (a great Civil War game 5 years ago!). The world conquering is slow and makes Civilization seem fast paced. I love the Civilivation games, I love real time strategy games, I love historical things, but I hated this game.
__label__1 Condition Misleading: Received the book quickly; however, the book was listed in "Good" condition which is misleading. The corners of the book look like a dog has chewed them. Multiple pages in the book are filled with writing. Condition is closer to a 4 out of 10 and I feel the condition should have been listed as "Acceptable". Although the shipping was expediant I wouldn't recommend purchasing from this user nor will I purchase from them in the future
__label__1 Good Recycling Material!!: This would make a hilarious movie to watch on Mystery Science Theater 2000 (MST3K)!!! I am only sorry I have to rate this with one star! If you offered less I would have chosen it!
__label__1 NO GOOD: I just don't understand how this mix is considered by some - - " as the best mix ever?? "(do you even know the difference between real house and BBB's music type) This isn't house music, It's more like your gym insructors or personal trainers arobic type of selections. Looks like BBB trying to follow into the stomping grounds of other well-known House jox above him. The results - Bad Idea. People....If you're into - loud vocally-speed disco, this is all for you.
__label__2 Todo Seru es genial: Con ciertas bandas y artistas resulta extremadamente difícil recomendar uno u otro trabajo. Serú Girán, la tercera banda que tuvo el genio musical Argentino Charly García (teclado, voz y otros) junto al maestro Pedro Aznar (bajo, voz y otros), David Lebón (guitarra y voces) y Oscar Moro (batería), es uno de esos casos. "Grasa de las capitales" contiene el tema que le da nombre al álbum, que posiblemente sea capaz de resumir la quintaesencia de la banda como ningún otro, pero es un crimen musical dejar por fuera, como secundarios, excelentes trabajos como el primer álbum de la banda ("Serú Girán"), "Bicicleta" o "Peperina". Sin duda alguna, recomiendo cualquier trabajo de la banda, sin temor a equivocarme. Se trata de uno de esos raros ensambles que reúne a varios genios, y cuyo resultado no puede ser otro sino una serie de increibles álbumes de muy buena música.
__label__1 Lots of Problems: This printer doesn't print consistently with my Windows XP laptop. It fails to print on most documents because of connection problems with the laptop. I am using it with a new Compaq 2800T running Windows XP Professional. All of the software is standard and updated. HP support has been very poor with suggestions like plug the printer directly into the wall. When it prints, the printer is noisy, uses a lot of ink, and has only average print quality. It also seems to be constructed of cheap parts.
__label__2 Hilarious!: We have numerous cats and the "cat butt" is just something you deal with from certain cats. We thought this was a hilarious item and we use them as fridge magnets. I could live without the included "free" hairball magnet though.
__label__1 DISSAPOINTED: I just bought this DVD and i was surprise i expected people dancing the whole hour with me, i hate to work out alone, i enrolled the gym and they have Zumba in their schedule but only 1 intructor is good and she only does zumba once a week, which is not enough for me, other instructors dont make me sweat at all, and i get so bored, i expected that this DVD will help me on my routines but definately i get even more bored exercising watching a video with just music on it, i have a lot of song by myself i just needed to play mi cd and dance but that's exactly i didnt want to do, again i'm so dissapointed
__label__2 Great Book: This is a great book by Golf's greatest player. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the game of golf.
__label__1 awful product I have ever had: I used this BD Digital thermometer over a month. It is awful product I have never purchased. The results were not correct. The results were never within basal BBT chart. The temperature should be between 97 to 99 Fahrenheit. It turned out every time was out of range. I used other brand of the thermometer,Vicks. That was totally fine. I am going to put this BD Digital thermometer in the trash. DON'T BUY THIS. By the way, if I could give this product zero star and I would.
__label__2 very good: this book is good because it shows a relation to the land we live on . we think we own it and we don't its just borrowed
__label__2 Cold milk!: Milk stays cold in these glasses. What a treat! We regularly wash them in the dishwasher with no problems.I have some of the 2 oz glasses in the same style that I use for espresso shots and was so pleased with those that I bought these.
__label__2 SG 3 is a little rough compared with 5 but still fun!: I have Super Granny 5 and love it, but I have played through it over and over. Super Granny 3 actually has some harder levels than 5, but it's because the game overall is rougher...meaning Granny doesn't respond as fast to turning, digging, and running ...and with less control combined with enemies that are faster, it is challenging! The visual background is also not sharp or as clear as Super Granny 5 but I am still glad I bought Super Granny 3. It's a great value. I am looking forward to trying Super Granny 6 as soon as I can get it to work on my computer;)
__label__2 Champion of All Ninjas: This movie is a valuable lesson in respect and fear of Interpol Ninjas. A must have for film students, Ninja enthusiasts, and students of Asian culture.Valuable lessions include:1) "It was my nipple, you jerk!"2) "Asian Boxing Champion"3) "Leave him alone, he's just a retard"
__label__1 Save your money: First, I thought that this scorekeeper had a belt clip. It does not. I just found out that the scorekeeper with the belt clip costs $5.00 more than this one. For someone who wears tennis skirts or shorts without deep pockets, this is very inconvenient.Second, this device should have cost $5 - $6.00 at most. Paying twenty dollars plus shipping and handling is way too much for the cheap plastic. My kids have received plastic trinkets on Halloween that are more durable than this. After playing around with the scorekeeper for two minutes, some of the sliders have already come loose. I am predicting that they will soon break apart.I think that this is one of the worst products that I've bought from Amazon. I will just have to improve my mental scorekeeping. I can't see myself using this product very much.
__label__2 for the DC fan: Perfect tie in for the rest of the series, voice acting as well as plot are second to none, the animation is tops notch!
__label__1 coffee pots: I had this machine for about a year before it just went dead. It was like the electrical mechanism went out or something. I have bought 2 cusinart coffee makers and both of them are junk. I have resorted to buying the $20 Mr. Coffee machine because it is better quality and lasts a whole lot longer than cuisinart brand. Buy at your own risk, but be ready to put money into another one soon.
__label__1 Don't Start with This One: If you're new to VBA, as I was, don't make the same mistake I did. This book is definitely not what I was hoping for. Very unorganized for a starter book, and not much good content. The book from the Wrox group is MUCH better.
__label__1 Extremely loud & incredibly close: I found this book very hard to read. It jumps around in time and I'm not always sure who is speaking. Could not get into it at all, hope the movie is 100% better!
__label__1 Haier quality is typically poor: YOU MAY WANT TO READ THE REVIEWS ABOUT OTHER HAIER PRODUCTS BEFORE BUYING THIS ONE.Haier products get bad reviews for poor quality and difficulty getting replacement parts. Even on this wine cooler, 1 person reports a problem.Also, many of them start making noise after a month of running and have to be unplugged for a while.You may luck out buying this:1. This one might be better made them other Haier products.2. You might get a good one.To set the baseline: Most reviews for appliances and electronics on Amazon are negative. Most reviews are written by people who bought a product, had trouble with it, and get even by writing a bad review. People who get good working electronics or appliances do not tend to write reviews, so you don't see the possitive experiences as much. (This is the opposite of music and books, where people tend to write about their favorite stuff).
__label__2 best measuring cups ever: I asked for these for Christmas as soon as I read about them. I love having the different sizes. If you obsess (like I do) about getting the measure exactly right, these are unbeatable. They are obviously best for liquids but work for dry ingredients as well. They're dishwasher safe, but easy to clean by hand. My only gripe is that the ridge on the inside makes them a little trickier to scrape when you have a thick liquid like oil or buttermilk and you want to get all of it down to the last drop. But, since this feature is what makes the cups what they are, it's hard to consider that a fault.
__label__1 Broken in less than a month: Yeah, it is cute. I really can't argue with that. But it broke in less than a month. It just doesn't want to work anymore. Worst money spent, and now it's going to the land-fill because it is unusable- that's the sad part. I'm going to look for an all metal safety can opener, so when it eventually breaks it can at least be recycled as scrap metal. My aunt had this cool one by Rikon, unfortunately it doesn't seem to come in all metal. In the meantime I'll be shopping around.
__label__2 Crafting a unique, personal, and relaxing atmosphere: Written by gardening expert Keith Davitt (winner of the Herald Award for Excellence in Garden Communication), Beyond The Lawn: Unique Outdoor Spaces For Modern Living is a simply beautiful and exceptionally "user friendly" sourcebook of ideas for creating harmony with stone, brick gravel, rock, water, herbs, conifers, planted pots, native and wild plants. Lavishly illustrated with full-color photography, Beyond The Lawn is a treat to page through and recommended for gardeners everywhere looking to add a bit of originality to the grounds outside their home. Offering a vast panoply of materials for crafting a unique, personal, and relaxing atmosphere, Beyond The Lawn is a welcome and enthusiastically recommended addition to professional and personal gardening reference collections.
__label__1 poor product: could not download my numbers to the device and tech support was not helpful. I have an LG phone.
__label__2 A triumph of the imagination: Francois Schuiten is one of the most accomplished artists working in the field.This handsome trade paperback reunites three graphic novels that comprise the Hollow Grounds cycle.Worth mention is the excellent arguments by his brother Luc.CARAPACES - Actually a collection of six stories that displays Schuiten's versatility, experimenting with a series of techniques.ZARA - Zara is a vertical planet inhabited entirely by woman that never experimented "conventional" sex with men.After the arrivalof invaders with "vines" below their waists, things take a bizarre and often amusing turn.Zara is a marvelous blend of satire, adventure and science fiction that should appeal for fans of trippy european comics.NOGEGON - Another baroque, amazing and wild adventure.This time a character from Zara goes in search of a missing friend andbecomes embroiled in a plot involving symmetry and murder.
__label__1 very funny stuff: Ashida Kim's works are very humurous works and should be regarded only as such. The techniques and philosphies presented in this book as well as Kim's others are not true to that taught by Dr. Hatsumi, the current legtimate grandmaster of the art. If you are seriously intrested in this subject I suggest a book by Dr. Hatsumi or S.K. Hayes. Ninpo ikan.
__label__1 Irresponsible and Unconvincing: Although getting a book published is an admirable feat for the average Joe, I must say that such is the only thing admirable about this author's endeavor.Without really any scientific or mathematical backing, the author talks circles around some of the most groundbreaking work in the area of physics in modern times. Rather than dispute such work with logic, however, this author uses doublespeak and "common-sense" analogies to dissuade the reader from believing what the greatest minds on the planet have asserted using mathematics, physics, logic, and the scientific process... to dissuade the reader, often, from believing much-proven fact.Whatever the motivation, this author's irresponsible work makes for an interesting read if one wishes to see what not to do when making an argument.If one is looking for an intelligent, persuasive, or piqueing new look at theories often taken for granted, one shuold definately look elsewhere.
__label__2 Worth the read I thought: You have to appreciate this book for taking a little bit of a different style than most of the 'document rehash' books out there. If you're looking for the nuts and bolts of the language constructs, this book is not for you. If you want to know the take on VB.NET for someone converting from other languages, you'll find Dan's perspective quite intriguing. I recommend this book to someone with programming experience but not quite up on it with .NET. You may or may not agree with all that Dan says but at least you'll know all the arguments.
__label__2 Great for the fisherman: Although the intended purpose is mostly for a surfer, my husband LOVES his watch for the use of being informed about the tides in our area for fishing. The instructions for setting up the watch were a bit confusing at first, but with a little attention it is a hurdle well worth overcoming for the payoff of the local information.
__label__2 Comfortable, just don't wear them in the rain: Extremely comfortable sandals, these are my second pair of this model. My first pair lasted almost 2 seasons of heavy usage, pretty much everyday. They held up well until i pulled the one strap clean off while running in the sand. Got the front caught under some sand and that was the end of them. Tried some other brands and nothing could compare to how comfortable these are. Beware though, do not try to wear these in the rain, the sole material gets extremely slippery when wet. You'd be better off going barefoot at that point. Take care of these, don't wear in the rain, and they should last you a few years of comfortable summers.
__label__2 OBSESSED!: I'm OBSESSED with Dancing with the Stars! I always told my husband that if Louis can get celebrities with no dance experience to dance like pros he could totally help me. Well my husband bought the DVDs for me and put me to the test...I'm not going to lie, I have never been a good dancer and I was horrified of the idea of anyone watching me so doing this at home was the only option for me - I have to say Louis makes it SO easy to follow!!! I still won't do the program in front of my husband, but I feel stronger and sexier and I am going to stick with this. It has really boosted my confidence!
__label__1 VIZIO 50" plasma tv is BAD: I bought ours from Sam's Club after a week of comparitive shopping, and wish I had not seen it. We had it three years when the power supply went out, and after a three month wait on the part and $458 in repairs, we only had it two more months before it went out again, this time some circuit boards with a repair cost of over $700 for parts alone. Gave up on it and bought a different brand.
__label__1 just terrible: I looked like the guy on the album cover while listening to this cd. I cried because it was way too painful to listen to this crap. People, go listen to some good music... and no that doesn't mean radiohead. Radiohead sucks. a lot. So if you like radiohead AND nickelback, you're a total dipshi.
__label__1 barely used, stopped working: used twice, the main light just flickers and never turns on. The night light is still functional. Based on what other reviews seems like a common problem.
__label__1 Don't be confused!: These are not essential oils...although the impression they give is they are. These are just like air fresheners and the other things you can buy that also fall into the "not pure essential oils" category. Granted, if you wanted to give them as a gift to someone who didn't really care, the price is right. But for the true aromatherpist, these don't fly. It's products like these that have given the term "aromatherapy" a bad reputation, becoming know as just "stuff that smells good" which is not what aromatherapy is about.
__label__1 Looks poorer than the online picture, and cheaper than its price: I had planned to have it as gift to my friend, but when I received the product, I changed my mind. It doesn't look that good. The digital part is hard to read and it doesn't match the analog reading. Awful.
__label__1 Ladder comes up short: I bought this ladder for a specific job requiring a ladder at least 12 feet long - end to end. This ladder, when fully extended is less than 10 feet - and that from end to end, not the last stepping position, which is even shorter I believe the reference to 13 feet is when the ladder is disassembled and laid end to end, in a non-useable manner. Regardless, if you are buying this ladder and need to reach 14 feet when you are on the last safe step this is the wrong ladder.
__label__2 Standing Room Only: Anything of Shirley Bassey's is great......Aliitle problem on my DVD player but ok on the computer, this needs to be made clear on buying items
__label__1 Rip-off in Book Form: The "author" of this book has taken the same text, and simply plugged in the key words that relate to the title. For example, if you happened to buy "How to Start and Manage a Landscaping Business" you would see the exact same text in this book, except that "Landscaping" would be changed to "Personnel Referral Service".There are dozens of titles that have been created this way. It is shameful that the author and publisher are making money on this scam.There is no concrete information about how to set up a personnel referral service business. Instead, it provides generalities, such as "make plenty of contacts" and "refer people to your website".The first clue that this book isn't worth its price is the poor print quality of the book, beginning with its card stock cover. While that in itself is not a problem, because there are many good books that have low production values in publication, the content does not redeem the book at all.Save your money, don't buy this book.
__label__2 Ryan comes back and nails it!!!: I love Ryan Cabrera. I didn't even have to hear one song off his new album in order to buy it...I love him that much! His last cd was awesome and this cd is even better! He definetly has more love songs on this cd, and if your into those types of songs you will LOVE it!!!!!! Not only have his lyrics gotten better but he has really matured on this cd. Buy it..you will not be disappointed!!!!!
__label__2 Every tackle box needs one: All of my tackle boxes have some sort of hook sharpener in them and I will say this one rates at the top. It does not take up any room to speak of and is so easy to pull the cover tube off and place it on the end for a handle. I find at times with smaller hooks, I don't even put the handle on so I can work with just the sharpening rod (easier to hold when working with small hooks). Have used it for touching up my pocket knife in the boat, but it is a bit small for serious knife sharpening and EZE-LAP does offer better models for this. I have shifted my sharpeners in the tackle boxes and the EZE-LAP S Pen Type is now in my main boxes that get about 90% of all my fishing use. I have no problem recommending this sharpener to anyone for their tackle box.Once you use it, you will be hooked. . . .and so will the fish
__label__2 Excellent Resource: Best $20 I have ever spent. The swaddling technique is a gift that should be shared with all new parents. Worked for us and now we get more sleep at night!
__label__1 "The master mechanic"walks among us.: Colangelo's explanation as to how he couldn't have been involved in the decision to tax the entire state for his private arena reminds one of another Chicagoan of Italian descent who was vacationing in Florida one winter at the time of the ST. Valentine's day massacre.
__label__1 Hogan's Heroes without the comedy: Well, after reading some of the reviews here, I was wondering if my DVD had the wrong disc in it. As what I got was an over talky, prison camp tale, which looked to be set in someone's back garden (probably N.J). A bunch of very overweight marine P.O.Ws and lots of discussion on war, National Socialism, the Eastern Front, etc, some nudity, some mild torture, and a whole lot more talking. The lighting is pretty poor and so are the sets and locations. There seems to be a real Russian girl (the cover girl) who is a decent actress and has a nice body, but I think she was wasting her energy here (maybe she is Tatyana Kot). I must admit, I couldn't make it to the end of the film... I really did try. It seemed to go on for ever..... well at least I can't spoil the ending for anyone.
__label__2 The Devil, indeed, is in the Details!: I just finished reading Jennifer Traig's incredibly engaging memoir. Who knew a book about a serious condition- OCD, more specifically srucpulosity- would be so entertaining, yet endearing? I was constantly reading parts of the books outloud to my husband, who was wondering why I was giggling.Traig is both a gifted and clever author as she gives us an inside peak into a world of extreme religion and cleanliness.The story was captivating, the writing wonderful, and yes, the devil is in the details. If you are considering buying this book, definitely buy it. Put a tissue on your head and read it!!
__label__1 terrible: On paper, the plot is interesting but the filming is terrible. If you like the Blair Witch style, maybe this movie is for you. The camera is shaky half the time and the set is too dark. They also spend way too much time exploring the house with no action. In summary, it's a good idea for a movie but the execution is terrible.
__label__1 Wonderful Magic Combination...: This is a wonderful DVD put out by Bill Gaither featuring the Gaither Vocal Band and Ernie Haase and Signature Sound. They are magical together. There is a unique blend of all their voices that is so great. The choice of songs on this DVD was spectacular, but I think the greatest one, if I had to pick just one, was "Sitting At the Feet of Jesus." I have many of the Bill Gaither VHS tapes and DVD's and although I don't have some of the older ones, I have not heard this particular song sung on any of them before. It has always been one of my very favorites. But this pairing of the two groups was nothing but inspirational on Bill's part to do this.
__label__2 Good Product: Reebok Fitwatch 10S Strapless Heart Rate Monitor Watch (Blue)Works quite well, but the watchband could have been designed a bit better.
__label__2 I like it: Very good headset for the price but if you tend to used it longer than a hr then ur ear will hurt
__label__2 GREAT READ: I gave this book to my girlfriend's brother who just got back from Iraq and needed a good laugh... he loved it and has passed it around to some of the soldiers from base. Free speech is an American right that they fought for... and as an American, I recommend that you read this book and excercise freedom of the funny bone.If we are ever to knit together the fabric of this country, we have to laugh at our differences. Mr. Leon's wit is a sharp needle which pierces through hypocracies of this decade's American right-wing cultural over-drive.His infiltration style is inventive, very playful and makes me think of a real life "Fletch" in our midst. This is by far Harmon's most provocative work yet, at a time where the country needs to reflect on its values; these adventures level the score in a comical way that is easy to digest and has thawed tensions... even opened intelligent discussion to all my friends who have read it. This is definately one of my favorite reads of the season.
__label__2 hot club sound...: I can listen to this song over and over again, and believe me I have. I'ts alot of fun and has a fresh club sound. Definately a European feel to it which is a nice change of pace from some of the music I've heard lately.
__label__1 Do not buy from this seller: I would never purchase from this seller. The book arrived extremely late and even though they would say it was within 14 days , I have never ever made a purchase that has actually before that has taken this long. The book is difficlut to read . It has large red pen writing on every single page - no word of exaggeration . Not my idea of a book to be called in "good" condition.Will never trust this seller again.They could never provide me with a tracking number in 14 days!
__label__2 The Best: Simply put, this is the Best CD I have every owned. I lost it once and had had had to buy another. I cann't live without it.A Must Have!
__label__2 better than 1 and 2: i think the first CD is considerably better than the 2ndmany of the songs have a good backbeat with excellent female vocals perfect on the dance floorthe best songs on the CD are:At the End (classic Iio with great vocals and backbeat)Diving (4 Strings in my opinion is always able to pull out a good song - Diving is one of my favorites)I Should Know (Despite the male vocalist, it was still a fairly good song, as it jut gives you an overall good feeling)
__label__2 Above-average quality at an affordable price: The truth is, you almost always get what you are paying for. In the case of this product, you are a bit above the average 'value' curve. It's not my 'number one' white tea but it is a solid 'number two'. The kind I drink almost like I drink water, several cups a day.The 'Stash Premium Tea' is not top of the line 'premium' but I enjoy drinking it. I guess, I could call it my 'staple' tea. Since I'm not into 'flavors', I actually have a subscription for the plain variety. These teas, I drink them every now and then or serve them to guests who may care for cup but they are not my daily drink.And, just in case someone did not know, there's nothing special about 'chai'. Translated into English, 'chai' means 'tea'.
__label__1 It still worked...: ... Although I pulled it out of its case all scratched up and looking like it had sat in water for days
__label__1 In all fairness I did not finish the book: I was very excited to read this book based on other reviews and the short excerpt. I ready about 25% of it and that I had to push through. It was really difficult to develop a true interest in the characters and the plot. The attempted sexual tension became annoying and superfluous. I would definitely be interested in learning more about that area but not by reading this book.
__label__2 NBA LIVE 2002, Its in the game: If you have played the 2003 and 2004 versions of NBA LIVE and played this version, you will find that they are pretty much the same. Especially the 2003, Players all look pretty much the same and there are not any new moves at all. NBA Live 2004 made some improvement but some of the AI is not tolerable. This game has great AI, and great game play with alot of flashy dunks. Sure some of the guys faces doesnt look as good as the 2003 or 2004, and sure, Michael Jordan still plays in this game, and yeh, Nba Live 2004 has that option where you can choose your favorite team and their colors and players will be showing int he menu, but so what? Aren't these sport games all about gameplay??? Petty features should be ignored and we should not encourage EA to make a sport game every year if the roster is THE ONLY thing to be changed. THis is definitely a cheaper but more worth your money NBA Live.Gameplay:9Sound: 8.5Graphics: 8.5Replay Value: 9Overall: 8.75
__label__1 Fun game, but you have to change 6 computer settings to play: I really enjoy playing this game, but you have to change 4 computer settings, and 2 Quicktime settings to play it, and that is a royal pain. Then I have to change them all back to the original settings to use the internet. I've NEVER had to do that with any software before this one, and I have a Pentium 3!
__label__1 Plastic!: It is almost impossible to determine if these wall supplies and holders are solid or plastic. Even the spec sheets don't always tell you. So I will let you know that if you are looking for solid brass don't buy this item as it is plastic and weighs almost nothing. I can't imagine this holding up to constant use by putting a heavy shower head in and out of it. And it is very expensive for a piece of plastic. I will keep looking.
__label__2 "Giant" doubts.: As much as I would like to I am dubious about buying this item as it was not due until the end of 07.As the price tag of $145.00, I would hate to wind up with an inferior set for that cost. Can anyone assure me that it is the OFFICIAL release, arriving early. Whenever it does, Hallelujah!!!
__label__1 RecyCKled: A HUGE disappointment. One would almost mistake this for a KC tribute album, were it not for the obviously stellar technical level of musicianship. THERE IS NOTHING NEW HERE. Lifeless retread. Bluster substituted for drama. Well, not quite. ProzaKc Blues manages to combine the "strengths" of the two (arguably) worst Crimson tracks of all time: "Ladies of the Road" and "Peoria". Give me "Starless", or "Three of a Perfect Pair", or any of the Soundscapes, or Belew's masterpiece "Twang Bar King", or indeed almost anything (except the equally soulless Thrak and its variants).
__label__2 AWESOME!: I have been wanting this movie because of Grace Jones for so long and could never find it by itself until recently. It is always tucked in with a boxed set of James Bond movies for a hefty price. Excellent movie, and Grace Jones is superb!
__label__1 Horrible Photo Paper: This paper is worse then just grabbing any plain ink jet paper and printing your photos. Do not buy this it is a waste of money. The photos print all smudged and bleeding.
__label__1 Not worth the money: While this CD does have a number of songs sang by members (or possibly former members) of the listed bands, the renditions are awful (sounded like cover bands doing tribute versions). The singing misses the crispness that the original versions have. If you are a fan of the genre, this CD is not for you.
__label__2 Why buy 4 when you can get 7?: I don't understand why people review products they haven't used, seen, etc. Actually I don't know why I'm writing a review myself. I just wanted to say that it seems pretty pointless to buy a box set of the 4 movies when there are still 3 movies left to be made! If you haven't watched the previous 4 movies, rent it out on DVD. (That is, when dvd 4 becomes available.) Otherwise, I suggest saving your money for the box set that has all 7 movies.However, that doesn't mean I don't think this box set has poor quality. On the contrary, I wouldn't expect anything less than great when it comes to its quality. Still, it doesn't make sense to buy movies 1-4 now and hope to buy a dvd box set of 5-7 later (or to buy movies 5-7 individually). The whole purpose of buying a box set is to save money right? Then, I suggest waiting (and renting) in the mean time.
__label__2 A Good Solid Par: Not a great book, but a good solid golf book.Too much instruction, not enough story-telling and reminiscing.The more you like golf, the more you will enjoy this book.The story of a good golfer and a great man...That alone makes it worth the read.
__label__1 not worth it: i was very disappointed with this ball. not only is it a serious pain to inflate, it hardly changes color. i had to run it under cold water and then was able to make a slight handprint only until the ball got back to room temperature. for $8.99 it's definitely not worth it and i am taking them back to the store i bought them from tomorrow. i would not recommend them to anyone.
__label__1 Stay away from this item - buy a newer model: I purchased two of these headsets for my wife and I, and neither item worked for more than two weeks. The charger ripped the tail piece off of my wife's headset, and my Jawbone stopped transmitting my voice. I have coworkers who love their Jawbone, but they have a newer version. This version is deep discounted because it is worthless.
__label__2 This is a top muscle magazine: I'm subscribed to several bodybuilding magazines, and this one, along with FLEX, are the best magazines that I've found to date. The small writeups in the front parts of the magazine are very informative and there are useful articles instead of junk everywhere like magazines such as MuscleMag.
__label__1 Instead of standing steady, I slipped x4: I thought these were going to give me a grip, but I fell down four times.When wet, it just would stick to my bath tub. Promptly returned (well after 4 days of falling down.)
__label__2 another great effort: I haven't purchased this cd yet, but manage a music store and have heard all of "A Whole New You" several times. I first became acquainted with Shawn when she hit the charts with "Sunny Came Home", bought that cd and found I liked pretty much every song on it.Then after hearing her new release, I was again impressed. Colvin has kind of a trademark dreamy-sounding voice with interesting stories and lyrics in her music. As with some of her other cd's, she ranges from optimistic to extremely cynical, while showing versatility throughout.This cd is great as background music if you're working or studying, but also outstanding to get you going in the morning or boost your spirits. Very enjoyable.
__label__1 Boo - Big Disappointment: DVD Releases are meant to add meaningful extras to the movie. In this case, the behind the scenes segment and the dancing segment (only includes Bop to the Top) were very thin. My family loved the movie when released on TV (we watched each version). The extras in the DVD added very little that we had not already seen on TV. Even my 8 year old asked to write a letter of complaint to Disney. Disney definitely mailed in this one after a superb effort on the original release.
__label__1 One Narcissism Grande to go!: I would like Amy Sohn (and Ariel Steiner) much better if they weren't so breathtakingly self-absorbed. Amy is a good writer, but it's hard after a while to care about and root for someone who is so completely consumed with themselves. She comes across as very insecure and very ambitious, which is a deadly combination.
__label__1 No. Just No.: looks cool. Key word people "looks" cool, it isn't bullet proof, please don't think it is, or that pockets make you look the part.
__label__1 User Guide, Yes, Study Guide NO!: It can't hurt to read this book, but as a study guide if fails.Firstly some of the answers were wrong. Worse, most of the questions don't appear in the exam.If you are interested in learning about some of the features in Dreamweaver, OK read this. But if you want to do the exam, buy something else. So, one star because it claims to be a study guide. Otherwise it would be three.
__label__2 Better than I expected: This is one of the best book in the series; it's doesn't show look that way in the beginning but every chapter gets better and better.
__label__1 Thin characters: I have to echo the sentiments of the previous reviewer. I'm an avid reader, but I'm finding this book difficult to finish. The character development is weak in my opinion -- I just don't care about these characters. Also, for the most part I don't find Patchett's language to be interesting, engaging or unique. I'm disappointed...
__label__1 Great document of a magic era!: This book looks at a cool time for rock and roll.Even better is "High On Rebellion;Inside the Underground at Max's Kansas City" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic FRogs, Jayne County,Cherry Vanilla,etc.THE REAL SCENE!
__label__1 Not for home studios, not worth $100: I am planning a home studio approx. 12X15 (180sf) in space. This book on building a ceramic studio is a lovely overview and picture book of several professional studios in southern climes, which I am not in and ranged size from 375sf to 5,000sf. Also, it was advertised on Amazon.com as retailing for $144.67, but I bought a used copy for $29.00 and feeling pretty good about the savings. It is printed right on the interior of the book jacket that the publisher's retail price is $24.95.This is not a critique of the contents of the book. But when I thought it was a $100 value, I assumed I was getting THE bible of home studios. Instead: the pictures were lovely, the info for professional artists planning a studio and showroom are probably good, but anyone at that level of the craft probably already knew alot of the info. And it was definitely not worth more than the original retail. Not too relevant for a home potter in New England.
__label__1 Yes - But a huge caution if you travel internationally: This product is awesome in terms of doing what it is designed to do.The real problem is whether/how it works when you travel outside of the US. I travel overseas a lot and really need a white noise machine in busy city hotels. I have had two of these units literally explode after a few minutes of being plugged in (once in Germany, the other in China). In both cases I was using a travel adapter that all my other appliances work with.There are no warnings/instructions or guidance of any kind about voltage / currents / using while traveling. There is some cryptic note that talks about this being "polarized like a table lamp" which means absolutely nothing to me and certainly doesn't help re: travelSuch a shame that a good product made in the USA has incomplete documentation that doesn't think beyond our borders.
__label__2 too sharp: these are good tweezers, but they are too sharp, its very hard to grab a hold of the finer hairs without breaking it.
__label__2 One of my favorite mystery writers: I have been waiting for the Nero Wolfe series to be available for Kindle, it seems like forever. I'm not as big a fan of Tecumseh Fox as Nero Wolfe, but a Rex Stout mystery is a Rex Stout mystery.I'm glad I purchased and read this book. It's a solid mystery with a good ending. I would expect that from Rex Stout. What I didn't expect, and really enjoyed, was the glimpses of Wolfe and Archie I got in Fox's personality. I found myself thinking, Wolfe would have said that or Archie would have done that.If another Fox book becomes available, I will definitely buy it. In the meantime, I am reading and loving "Over My Dead Body" featuring Wolfe and Archie.
__label__2 good sound on a budget: used these to replace the factory speakers in my Chevy Colorado. with some modification was able to put in the back doors also. The Sound is much better than expected, especially with Baupunkt head unit.
__label__2 Excellent: Excellent gift. It is very useful. My dad love it and use it for every thing. It is a excellent tool
__label__1 Dissapointed: Movie is in French with English subtitles and is about a man dying of a brain disease and a young married woman who loves him. As his disease progresses his words make no sense -- but this whole movie makes no sense. I loved Sophie Marceau in Firefly and thought this would be another wonderful love story, but it's very hard to follow with flashbacks from both of their pasts which torment them still. Rent it instead because you won't want to watch it again.
__label__2 Great CD!: Bought this for my 16 year old son, he loved it! I enjoy listening to it as well. Great Jazz music!
__label__1 My rating is for the product description: It doesn't say anywhere I could see whether these bottles are glass or plastic (or something else). I inferred from some reviews that they are BPA. Well, then, we'd rather go for glass bottles. Safety concerns you see...
__label__1 Diary of a massacre: The "remastering" - read butchering imposed to this metal classic by the Osbournes and/or their record company is unbelievable. Kudos for making it like s*** too. Get the original album. This is not Ozzy and will definitely remain a stain on his legacy.
__label__1 Slow and boring: This is sort of a cross between Blair witch project and Paranormal event. The main character appears to be aimlessly roaming around and jumping at shadows and at the slightest noise. Save your money and skip this one.
__label__1 Shark: If only looks painted the whole picture. When you first put the shark in he looks great and his swimming is great as well. However the shark basically sticks to the sides of the pool and follows it until it ends up getting sucked in by the (whatever the suction thing is called in a pool)My advice by the multiple fish instead of the shark.
__label__2 Cool product: It's all black. It's a cool alternative to the usual stainless with orange rubber reflex hammer. I'll definitely buy one another for my future practice.
__label__1 Excellent show, Horrible sound quality: In 1968, the Brazilian dictatorship briefly imprisoned Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, in an effort to curb the popular influence of the tropicalistas. Once the singers got their warning and were released, they promptly went off and staged several concerts as an act of political defiance, which in turn lead to their European exile. This CD is a document of two shows in July, 1969 -- spirited and adventurous pop-psychedelic rock, but with terrible sound quality. The guitars come in okay, though a bit muffled, but the powerful vocal performances are completely overmodulated. A tantalizing glimpse at Brazilian pop-psych in glorious full swing, and an important historical document, but ultimately a real drag to listen to. (Quoted from Slipcue E-zine)
__label__1 I wish I hadn't spent the money: This CD was a big letdown. I really like SheDaisy's first CD, but on this one all the songs sound the same and almost amatuerish--just when you start getting into a song, out pops some discordant harmony. I wish I hadn't bought it.
__label__2 Pondering American History: This book was eye opening. There are few books that can transport a reader through time.. When I was a Slave, has done, just that. There is nothing like the simplicity of a personal story told by the person who's experience it was, to give it impact and authenticity. It was this book which gave me a clear sense of the severity and condition that the american slaves were subject to. I am a white American. I am touched so deeply by all of these stories. It's as if, Each of them were my great grandparents sitting by the fire telling me stories of thier young years. the anger and Sadness the joy and happiness in spite of conditions , direct my soul to seek understanding and sustain a vigilant guard to recognizing hatred, condeming hatred and clipping the roots of hatred when it sprouts up in this world. I may not be black but this is my American history too. The pain I feel for my fellow Americans is truth.
__label__1 Cruel and Depressing Story: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.
__label__2 The softest butteriest sheets you will ever own!: I got these in the cream color. They are almost a butter color. They are hands down the softest flannel sheets I have ever had the priveledge of sleeping on. I have purchased some of the best flannel sheets out there and these are the best in my opinion. I sleep like an angel on these. I have washed these several times and there is no pilling at all. They fit my king size bed perfectly even after washing and drying in a hot dryer. There is no shrinkage. I will definately buy another set of these sheets but I am trying another color. You will not be dissapointed in the quality and softness of these wonderful sheets.
__label__1 Disapointed Kingsolver fan: I am a Kingsolver fan. I think she is a poet with her words. Many can spin a story but Kingsolver uses the words themselves as an art medium. That said, however, Prodigal Summer was a major disappointment to me. In her other books her messages (moral-what we are to learn, etc.) were delivered in a subtle unconscious way. Prodigal Summer PREACHES and LECTURES and HITS you over the head with it's messages on environment, tolerance, etc. in an almost patronizing manner. Her characters this time are not nearly as realistic and spontaneous as in earlier books. They seem contrived for the purposes of Kingsolver's points. And what's with all the sex scenes? I don't understand the need to TELL all. What do writers think they are proving? Cheap thrills is how it comes across. Kingsolver's genius lies in her subtlety which this book almost completely lacks.
__label__1 Excellent Music -- But Don't Buy it in this Form!: These are classic recordings, but as several Amazon reviewers have noted, the sound quality on this set is not very good. Fortunately, all the recordings on this set, plus some alternative takes, are now available in vastly improved sound quality on RCA's new "Never No Lament: The Blanton-Webster Band" (ASIN: B00008J2IX). I strongly recommend that set over this one; this is absolutely essential jazz, and it deserves to be heard in the highest fidelity possible.
__label__1 Ugh: If you want scifi go elsewhere. If you want an arrogant polemic then this is your book. What a waste of time (pun fully intended).
__label__2 Great gate for smaller doorways: I was originally unhappy with the purchase of this gate because they did not expand enough to give me a sturdy connection to the walls. I live in an apartment and do not have any extreme doorways, they are about 34" apart. The gate fit but was very unstable. So I had to purchase the extension which fixed the problem. They are nice and sturdy and work great. I would recommend this gate to anyone who would like a hands free system.
__label__1 try Robin Williams in "Hook": Well....my little cousin is doing a play on "Peter Pan", so she had to get inspiration. I told her to go a head and rent Robin Williams in "Hook". But no, she rents the new version, so I said ok I might as well watch it. I told her to take it back and get her money back from blockbuster. This is a terrible adaption to the Peter Pan story. First goes off as the acting, kids these days suck. This guys performances was worser than Elizabeth Berkley in "Showgirls". I mean the special effects have gone better, but this is just too bad. Too too bad actually.This is definitley the worst family film of 2003 next to "Good Boy". Please, if you want to show your kids a great family film, try toy story or pee wee's big adventure. Or if you want to show them a peter pan movie, its all about robin williams in Hook.
__label__2 Best written book i've read in a while: i have read all of the author's books written under the name c.s. harris and now all but one of Candice Proctor. i have enjoyed them all. this book is by far the most well written about the love the 2 main characters share that i have ever read. they love so deeply you can almost feel it as you read. in my opinion that is a GREAT author.
__label__1 Minority voice: He played with bear poop in a giddy high, was NOT a scientist, but thought bears were neat-o, set up a tent near them, got himself and his friend killed, gave them corny names to feel "connected", put himself in every shot of film, and reviewers think he is a saint! Why? Because he got himself killed? I know I am the only person in the world to think this. I am the minority. It's not like a trained scientist studying grizzly bears was killed, it was a wacko who was like a homeless person with no life.
__label__2 This Guy Makes Robert Jordon look like Disney World: As always with a Tad Williams book you get a lot of distribution so be prepared for environments that are so keenly described you could cut them with a knife.Simon "Snowlock" is just starting to come into his own as a great warrior and it is wonderful to watch him and his friends mature and grow as the book goes on. The heroes lose and gain more and more allies as the book goes on(some of these the reader will grow really attached toIf you want a long description of the plot you can read the back of the book and it is a good plot and story that will keep you guessing. However as with all Tad Williams books you must understand that these books are BIG so don't read them if you are one of those people who reads a book and puts it down.
__label__1 Calling it a Noise Canceling Headphone a big joke: Have been using it for past month plus, but the same by no means can be called as a noise cancelling headphone. I purchsed relying on the name - SONY, but this product has not lived upto the standards of the company. The 1 star rating is for headphone working properly as a normal headphone. When wearing the headphone and switching on the noise canceling and listening songs from my Sandisk MP3 player, even the keyboard strokes of my laptop I was using could be heard so easily. I felt I would have purchased a better product at 30$ - normal headphones...
__label__1 Three Strikes: A called third strike for MLB on their "The Boston Red Sox 2007 World Series Collector's Edition." Note that the presentation is in standard sound and square screen video format. I'll have to make due with my memories of FOX's dolby digital high-def original broadcast.
__label__2 Huxley was not conned, the bates method saved his sight: Huxley used the bates method to save his failing eyesight. The Bates method is not a hoax. I have used it for 20 years and continue to receive many benefits. Huxley was not selling a hoax, he was sharing the truth with the public.
__label__2 RefrigWalter Filter: Didn't realize it had been so long since we replaced our refrigerator water filter...so thank goodness for products online thru Amazon...The GE Filter came as promised, we installed & its working great....for another 6 mo or year...we hope!
__label__1 Another Right winger Cry Baby: Why these conservatives are acting like cry babies?Shut Up and dance baby!
__label__1 Can't escape the fragrance: It's a good thing I decided to do a test run with this product one evening when I was not going anywhere. Washed and dried my hair, applied product to areas of scalp. Noticed smell of product right away, checked ingredients, of course "fragrance" was listed. Seemed kinda dumb, but I figured perhaps it was added to mask some less pleasant chemical ingredient odor. Problem was that an hour later (product was by then of course definitely completely dry), the fragrance had not faded and was driving me nuts. I did not want to end up with my pillow or anything else smelling of the fragrance, so had to wash my hair again.As far as the product's intended purpose, it didn't look so great, but I imagine its appearance might improve as one got more practice applying it.Due to the darn smell, though, I tossed the whole tube into the trash. What a waste.
__label__1 Not Worth the Money - Don't Buy It: I purchased this trailer for my grandson for whom I bought a Bruder Dump Truck last Christmas(It has a trailer hitch).When I received the trailer which is also made by Bruder, it was flimsy and the trailer hitch hole was too small for the hook-up on the dump truck. I had no use for it and my grandson was also disappointed. I returned it the next day.
__label__2 I LUV LOTR!: I am a Lord of the Rings enthusiast, Ive watched the movie 20 times (date today, 9/12. I luv legolas!) and the first time I saw it, I thought: this move would make a great game! well, from all the reviews, It's lived up to that. I for one will probably play as legolas, since he can fire arrows about two or three times a second, but with this game, you can't win by pushing the same buttons repeatedly. You need to do combos of hits and different combinations, or the enemy will catch on to what you're doing. Also, don't think that the troll in Balin's toom is the only one in the game. They can pop up anywhere. I mean ANYWHERE. The game developers said that themselves. Just don't turn your back on the screen, and you'll be fine. :D
__label__2 AWSOME DUDE!!!!!!: THIS HELMET IS JUST FAR OUT ITS AWOSOME I HAVE LOTS OF BRATZ ITEMS ON MY WISH LIST CAUS E I LOVE THEM AND THIS HELMET MACHT WITH MY BRATZ SCOOTER AND BIKE FROM WAL-MART AWSOME
__label__1 Um............"overkill?": If we, the Stones' fans, haven't kept this...uh..."memoribilia," we sure ain't going to recycle now. The "Exile" cards are worth something...so what? The music is worth more than the silly entrapments. Betcha the Stones themselves had naught to do with this.
__label__1 Historically interesting but hugely outdated: Buckley is so stiff and untelegenic in his leather wing-back chair that it is almost impossible to soak up the content of his lecture. I'm sure that in the mid 80s this video and its "computer animation" was cutting edge, but today its production values are laughably quaint. His clenched-jaw Yale voice is so grating that my wife and I turned it off after 5 excruciating minutes. I simply cannot believe that no better source for this information has been produced in the last 20 years. The $30 price tag is insulting.
__label__1 Major disappointment: I was extremely disappointed with this CD. I feel Mr. Henley is an incredible hyproctrite, getting VERY rich off of the people he slams in these mediocre songs. As for the music, I think the word "boring" sums it up best.A major disappointment.
__label__2 A wonderful little book with a big message: I've been on a fiction kick lately - first Gideon's Gift, then The Lullaby, and now The Touch! This book will take you only a couple of hours to read, but there is SO much there! The book was inspired by the picture painted by Ron DiCianni which depicts the woman who touches the hem of Jesus' cloak and is healed.A young woman is fleeing an abusive marriage with her two young children. She lives in a sleazy motel, being a housekeeper there in order to have a place to live. Meanwhile, her father is dealing with issues of his own. The way it all comes together is beautiful.This was my first book by Patricia Hickman and I will definitely be looking for more.
__label__2 One of the best albums ever!!!!!: Listen to "No Love" and "Don't Hate Me" and you will understand true emotional suffering.....
__label__1 Not a Catholic bible: Although this bible has many wonderful features, Catholics should be aware that this bible is NOT A CATHOLIC translation and is missing the 7 books that protestants removed during the reformation. Also, some of the supplemental material is not in line with the teaching of the magesterium of the Catholic Church. Buyer beware...48% of the Marines are Catholic and we don't want them being deceived by this non Catholic bible.
__label__1 Finish bad within 1 month: After less than 1 month of use, the entire exterior of the chiminea is spotted, pitted, and streaked. It does not come off. i sent pictures off to Blue Rooster, who promptly replied that it was called OXIDATION, and could be easily fixed with a good scrub down and a couple of coats of high heat BBQ paint. I really don't feel that I should have to go through this after less than a month. If what is needed to prevent this from happening is a couple of coats of high heat BBQ paint, then why wasn't this applied at the factory? I am waiting to see how this will be resolved.The company has refunded the purchase price in full. I do not know why the finish turned so bad so fast, however am pleased with the way the company handled it. I feel that I should add that, apart from the finish, there was nothing else wrong with the chiminea
__label__1 Stale, old, pitiful: Gourmet? There was large disappointment when we opened this box to find kettle corn that was old and stale, as well as all stuck together. Maybe it got wet - maybe it stayed in the warehouse too long. Don't waste your money - buy something else!
__label__1 Not enough detail and too much repetition: I stopped reading not even half way through. The author gives an overview for the chapter that explains quite a bit about each topic. Then, when the topic is revisited, basically states the same as was covered in the overview. As a result, the book could have been a lot shorter without the redundancy makig it even more expensive per page of real content than other reviewers have noted.
__label__2 descent for rad onc: Descent book for Residents entering radiation oncology.. Good resource for those who are currently in the field.
__label__2 Part of the holy trinity of 70's funk soundtracks: Car Wash, Shaft and this. That's all you need. There's more great funk out there (James Brown (of course), Funkadelic/Parliament, the Meters, the Temptations, early Kool and the Gang), but as far as soundtracks go these 3 are the bomb. Oh, I suppose I really should add the Saturday Night Fever OST to the list. So, the holy foresome, then.
__label__2 Midsomer Series Collections: I bought every set Amazon has and am eagerly awaiting the current Midsommer season, which BBCA chose NOT to air in the US. The stories are well written, the acting excellent, and the settings beautiful. They rival any PBS Mystery Series in every way. Worth every penny.
__label__2 Great place to start and more: This book is great about being very clear and explaining different aspects of option trading. The first book I bought on options trading didn't come close to this book and cost way more. This is the perfect book for beginners and maybe even for people who have basic knowledge of options trading. It begins with how options work and gets as far as taxation on options to even touching down on trend trading. I fully support this book if you are getting into options. After reading this book it will be hard to find another one with as much depth. I would recommend 'The Bible of Options Strategies'after reading this book and your options trading career will be well on its way.
__label__1 Not my dream paper for greeting cards.: I was so looking forward to receiving Avery's textured greeting cards as I had worked with some of their products before like their white notecard paper and half fold white greeting cards and was quite pleased with them. Unfortunately I found myself feeling very disappointed with these textured cards. Although the paper has a nice texture to it, it is way too flimsy. And the quality of the prints compared to avery's half fold white cards leaves a lot to be desired for. A waste of my money really! Perhaps I will use the paper to make drawings instead and stick to their textured free paper for greeting cards.
__label__1 Bad Experience: I purchased the Stack-On PS-514 Personal Safe with Electronic Lock from (name deleted, per Amazon.com) for $44.99. The packaging was damaged as described, and appeared to have been returned previously, which I don't have a problem with. However, the safe would not open with the keys provided in order to program the keypad, so it was useless. The unnamed seller offered me the choice of a full refund or a partial refund and I could obtain replacement keys on my own from Stack-on. I opted for a full refund. However, I had to cover all the shipping costs. I paid $32.23 for expedited shipping and $12.89 for the return shipping, so I'm out of pocket for $45.12, more than the cost of the item, and I'm still without my safe. The safe seems like it would have been decent, if it actually worked.
__label__1 Nothing new here: I listened to this book on CD on a road trip to New England. It was good enough to keep me awake and fairly entertained. I've never read Cussler before but I do enjoy the genre. Valhalla Rising follows the action thriller formula too perfectly. There's nothing fresh.Furthermore, Cussler eludes to historic events and fictional tales and how they may tie in with the main storyline. I spent most of the time wondering how he would tie them in. I won't spoil it for you, but there really wasn't much a tie-in at all. That was disappointing. Furthermore after the climax, the book keeps going. I don't know why. I was beginning to think there was going to be more action, but no. Just a long ending.I have heard that Cussler's other books are quite good, so I will suggest not starting with this one.
__label__1 Lame, Don't waste your time!: Poorly written, characters that you couldn't care less about, weak plot that is so unbelievable it's not even entertaining--read anything but this book! Not worth the paper it's written on.

__label__1 Interesting, But Unnecessary...: Scorcese's film is certainly unique and raises some good questions. Those critical of so-called "religious zealots" (see review below) should remember that no one who has attacked the film is denying that Christ was also human. But being tempted and actually sinning are two different things. According to Biblical account, for Christ's crucifixion to have meant anything at all, he had to be sinless. Thus, a Christian like myself would be expected to take offense at a film like this. At the same time, I understand the questions Scorcese was raising with the film, and there are some valid points. I know Jesus was tempted; it is referenced in the Scriptures. But the humanity of Christ could have been portrayed in a more subtle way. On top of all that, I just found it to be a pretty boring piece of film - from Scorcese, of all people. Time seemed to slow down for awhile there. Two hours felt a lot longer, and that's just poor filmaking...
__label__1 Please take away the author's word processor!: Too long.Too much smoking and drinking.Too much bizarre sex.A disappointment, because it could have been much better.
__label__1 A melancholy read: Wow. Many, many times I wanted to chuck this book and give up, it was that torturous to slug through, but I didn't and I'm sorry I didn't. I kept waiting for something, anything to happen. Don't waste your time.
__label__1 Terrible book: I was hoping for a clear and critical essay of Friedman's ideas of free-market capitalism. (Perhaps something in the tradition of Keynes?) Instead what I got was a propaganda filled hack job: Rayack does a poor job countering any of the obvious successes of the free-market system and he does an even worse job tackling Friedman. Rayack has an obviously biased understanding of the economic and political situation in Chile; He assigns blame on Friedman and the free-market for problems in the country, in 1987, when this book was written. However, since 1987, Chile has had one of the most vibrant and dynamic economies in South America. This is a shallow and coarse work. Do not even think of buying this book when you can borrow it from a library: You will be exercising your "free choice" not to waste your hard earned money.
__label__2 Recommended: I would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn a lot more of the technical aspect of the Japanese Navy and how they started World War II with the 3rd largest Navy and why it contained the ships it did. Great book.
__label__1 Awful: This is another one of those acdemic type of books that your professor forces you to read for class that is totally bad. The author seems to go no where with the point they are trying to make and it drones on and on until the end, when you finally realize you have gone no where reading this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
__label__1 Thief broke the plastic loop: When I used this product, I worried that the piece being superglued could come off, but when my monitor was stolen the thief attemted to rip the piece off the desk, the piece held on the desk and the plastic piece broke allowing the wire free. Now I am looking for one that is metal.
__label__2 Laughing Boy: "Laughing Boy" by Oliver La Farge was written in in 1920. It Called a Navajo love story, it is beautifully written and wne the Pulitzer. My book club selected it. It is considered a classic.
__label__1 Terrible product: The aerosol spray is very bad. Two different bottles stopped spraying when still half full. It cleans well, but the aerosol spray wastes half the bottle
__label__1 albert the apple eating appaloosa: I ordered this book because my grandson loves horses and is having trouble with reading. I thought this would be a great book for him to practice his reading. I was so disappointed when the book arrived. The packaging was fine but the text was terrible. The stories were disjointed and made no sense. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I could have returned the book for a refund but chose to keep it and use it as an example of the worst writing I have ever read in a published book.
__label__2 Used this on a sand pile in my back yard: because my dogs love to lay in it and were bringing all sorts of creatures into my home. It seems to have stopped that from happening anymore.
__label__1 Put a fork in him..... he's done.: If you like vulgar jokes this might be for you. He better stick with the Ford commercials where someone else writes the material.
__label__2 Outstanding music, lyrics, and atmospherics: Musical innovation at its best. Count me as one of the many new AvA fans. AvA has a distinct sound that's all their own--and it's good stuff! Tom's voice is one of a kind and his lyrical ability is one of the best. Unlike Blink, AvA's lyrics are mature, optimistic, and uplifting--this is very refreshing and one of reasons I like their music so much. There is "real"-ness and grit to the lyrics, but without the contrived angst that permeates so much modern rock. Put simply, the music makes you feel good and I imagine that it's cathartic for Tom to be able to express his true voice unabashedly in ways he's never been able to do before.
__label__2 A terrific read for all ages!: The Adventures of Blue Avenger is a smart and sophisticated novel that adults, young adults, and early teen readers will enjoy alike. In response to another reviewer on this page, I do not believe this book is only appropriate for those over the age of fourteen - in fact, the book is justifiably included in Scholastic's book catalog for 6th graders (11 - 12 years old)...there's nothing objectionable about it. Read, and enjoy!
__label__1 Not What I Was Hoping: I found the acting to be painfully unreal and the events not to be thorough. I would have preferred to have a good audio-book about Hudson Taylor if they can't get actors who are believable.
__label__1 DHS Clear Shampoo: As I have very sensitive skin, this product was recommended to me by my dermotologist. Unfortunately, after having spent a fair amount of $$ to order/ship the product, it was not good for my scalp. I appear to be allergic to some ingredient(s) in the product - my scalp got dry, flaky and itchy within 24 hours of using (I tried using it 3 times to ensure the shampoo was the problem).
__label__1 Polaroid one 600 instant camera ultra: I purchased this camera because of the promise of great, portrait quality prints, sharp image, 2 foot focus, etc. and am soundly disappointed. The quality of the prints is TERRIBLE-- fuzzy, no detail, etc. (and I am not a perfectionist!!) It feels cheap, the paper is expensive-- which I could accept if the quality were slightly above average-- but I consider this a TOTAL waste of money.
__label__1 Buyer Beware: FYI, this is not the concert of the same title. Just a bunch of blokes talking about how great the band is.
__label__2 A Soothing Voice In a Chaotic World: If there is one musical constant in a world of chaos it is the soothing voice and melodic songs of Enya. I love her and her music. Her voice, music and her very being are inexorably intertwined giving us a feeling of warmth and passion in our hearts that I can not find the words to describe. How can I describe exactly how lovingly she finds the beauty that is still in our world, a beauty that each of us carries inside like a piece of some great cosmic puzzle that only has to be realized. Perhaps long in coming but I love the wait and savor the moment and here is Amarantine. I truly love every track but there seems to be a special place for "It's in the Rain" for me. I have said what I have tried to put into words. I just love her music.
__label__2 Best ALL Album Ever!: This is simply the best most catchy ALL album ever. The best song is by far "Make Believe" even though most would agrue that track as made without much tought. Personally thats what i believe, I think if you just click a few of the samples you will see what i mean.
__label__2 Why Don't They Release 45RPM Version On My World Is Empty W/out You?: The only problem I have with Motown Reissues is that they never include the original 45 RPM mixes of their sides. If anybody out there remembers, My World Is Empty Without You in it's hit 45RPM mix had the girls in a echo chamber with the violins more prominent in the mix. The stereo version is flat noisy and both the violins and the back-up voices of Flo and Mary are inaudible. I grew up and have all the vinyl mono sides which in most cases are vastly superior to these awful stereo mixes. Remember you people MONO was industry standard when these discs were released, and as I remember the stereo versions even in LP format were hard to come by. Back to Mono on all Motown compilations!!
__label__1 a piece of junk: I ordered this electric swatter because it appeared to be 'heavy duty.' I don't mean killing large bugs, but doing a good job and lasting a while. I wouldn't know if it does either because it didn't work. I installed two D batteries, pressed the yellow button, and nothing happened. Not only didn't the little red light come on, the yellow 'on' button didn't even move. I'm not surprised - it's made in China. I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this item.
__label__2 Not for the Color Blind: An excellent game in which players build sets based on number, shape, color and pattern. I want to like it, but most of the folks at my house are color blind and have a hard time differentiating between the red, green and blue cards. The non-color blind have a definite advantage!
__label__2 Good game for DS beginners: This was my first game for my Polar White DS and I was obsessed. I'd never played any other pet stimulation games before, and I loved it. There's are some pros and cons though.Pros:-Exellent graphics-Cool use of microphone-Bark Mode is cool-Not challenging, just fun-Realistic (for example, your dog gets hungry, thirsty, and dirty when you don't take care of it)Cons:-Gets boring after a while-Voice recegnition unclear, takes a while-Not many things to doHope you found this helpful. :D
__label__2 Pratchett just gets funnier: Ankh Morepork and Klatchia are set to go to war over a newly risen piece of seabed (Atlantis was never like this - there is octopus art everywhere) apparently worth nothing to anyone - except perhaps if they wanted to start a war. Samuel Vimes, head of the Night Watch, has a personal organiser that has, listed under things to do today, the entry "die", and his butler has gone off to enlist. Vimes' day goes strictly down hill after an attempted assasination attempt of the Klatchian Ambassador, apparently by someone too weak to shoot the bow; Sgt Colon and Corp Nobby Nobbes go AWOL; and Corp Angua, the werewolf in watchwoman's clothing, is being held hostage and won't let the hostage-takers go. Typical Pratchett. If he gets any funnier, you'll need a doctor's advice before reading.
__label__1 Not for Mahjongg players: Have trouble navigating thru the different games. I just wanted a simple game of Mahjongg, instead I get this. Do not like the product at all.
__label__1 Sounds like a great idea, BUT.......: It read on the back like a great book. Inside though is another story. I am halfway thru it and I have not seen him CLEAN anything. It is too slow, but I want to still read to find out what happens.It is a rough patch now but I am sloggin through. If it does not pick up soon I will give up.Welty69
__label__1 Poorly finished and packaged: These are far, far from "ready for use" as described above. The cutting edges look like they were made by someone who really didn't care. These will take a lot longer than planned for refinishing before use. I thought "Made in Sheffield England" was supposed to be a statement of quality. I think they should start taking lessons from the Chinese. I also ordered separate 1 1/4" and 1 1/2" chisels which were even worse, with both having a chip on the cutting edge. I'll be reviewing those separately and rating them even lower.This set is packaged in a flimsy lightweight cardboard box with 3 equally flimsy cardboard dividers between the 6 chisels. It is a joke. The chisel handles were all a little roughed-up, but no damage to the cutting edges.
__label__2 Just one word ....."Mesmerising": "The man who cried" the title itself says such a lot of things to the viewer, an amazing performence by Johnny Depp who played the role of a man who can commnunicate with eyes, one of his best performences ever indeed. The chemistry between Ricci and Depp is excellent and beyond words. The film has its sensitive, happy, erotic and sad moments, but nevertheless beautifull. Christina Ricci was fabulous, she potrayed every sentiment beautifully and you can see that easily. A film worth a watch, if you like Silent dramas. Worth watching for good cast-performences, wonderfull musical scores and last but not the least, a good chemistry between actors.
__label__1 Oh Please!: So Buchanan wants America to reclaim her white, Christian origins?Well, he got the white part right, but his definition of "Christian" is a little askew. His ideas on Christianity are a complete and utter perversion of the message. Want proof? Just read his comments about the murder of Matthew Shephard.
__label__2 Judge Dee mysteries always a good read: The best Judge Dee mysteries are the ones with "Chinese" in the title, but The Red Pavilion is a good read nevertheless. Van Gulik had detailed and in-depth knowledge of things Chinese, and conveys this knowledge with a light touch which is very readable.The setting is on a "pleasure island" the ancient Chinese equivalent of Las Vegas. There's lots of local color, and an intricate plot.
__label__1 The Answers Are Wrong!: The author attempts to answer twenty questions from a young earth perspective. Several of the questions are irrelevent to the creationist debate. The rest are full of young earth creationist arguments which are easy to rebut. Overall, no evidence is presented to indicate that the earth is young. For a full review, see www.answersincreation.org/bookreview.htm.
__label__2 bye bye pack and play: we just purchased this for our one week Disney trip. our daughter is 15 months old and a toss and turn kind of gal. she did really well in it. didn't roll off or anything. we were tired of bringing the pack and play because it's heavy and would be considered a check luggage on airline. plus we were checking in our car seat as luggage. nowadays, it cost money to check in bags with most airlines and a few airlines only let you check in one bag for free so this aero bed is perfect because we can fit it in our suitcase although we end up putting it in our car seat travel bag (JL Childress Ultimate Car Seat Travel Bag) along with our Britax Marathon car seat in it. why waste any luggage space if we had to check in our car seat anyway?
__label__1 Poor Shiping: The product was never delivered. When I called to inquire about my order I was informed that it was delivered on April 30, 2010. I was also told by a "customer service rep" that there was nothing he could do to help me and I should contact the USPS in my town to check on the delivery. I don't know what this company thinks customer service is? But I know that if this is the way I ran my customer service for my customers, I would be out of business. I know I will never do business with this merchant again.
__label__2 Looks like the picture: I got this as a gift and the recipient loved it. It looks just like it does in the picture and it is something that you can wear with whatever color you like. I'm glad I bought it.
__label__1 Save receipt: I bought this about 4 months ago, and it no longer works. I liked it for ease of use and sound quality. It had to be reset frequently, and after the last reset it remained frozen, and then, just died. I checked and the warranty for labor is good for only 90 days. I've lost the receipt, but since the labor warranty is only for 90 days I doubt it would be worth fixing. I replaced a Creative Zen Touch with this. I had the Touch for three trouble-free years. This is much smaller and much poorer quality. If you buy it, save the receipt because you'll need it.
__label__1 Not working for me: I have been using this for about 3 weeks twice a day and my dark circles haven't lightened up at all. Mine are hereditary - maybe nothing can get rid of them :(
__label__2 Worth the Price: The title says French/English and people think it is different from English version. But it is not. I have been using the American-English accent without any problem. It is not as good as my Nuvi-350 but is really worth the price you pay.
__label__2 Another great album from a band destined for greatness!!: If you liked The Donnas before, you'll like them even more now. If you don't know who The Donnas are, after this album, you will.With better, beefier production than it's predecessor "American Teenage Rock And Roll Machine", this album just flat out rocks, musically. And the lyrics, well...the lyrics make you smile, because it's the way you probably felt when you were a teenager, but were too embarassed to admit it.This album (which includes a great cover of the Motley Crue classic "Too Fast For Love") is typical Donnas. Drop The Ramones, "Dressed To Kill"-era KISS, and a touch of The Runaways in a blender, and top it off with the punk-pop sensibilities of "Dream Police"-era Cheap Trick, and you'll come pretty close to the rock'n'roll party that is The Donnas.Don't miss out on this one, because I think it may be the start of something big!!!
__label__2 If you like Rumpole, you'll like Felix.: In his book The Joys of Yiddish, Leo Rosten sets out the distinction betwen a schlemiel (a fool) and a schlimazel (one prone to misfortune)thusly: A schlemiel is the waiter that trips while carrying a large bowl of soup to a table. The schlimazel is the person that ends up with the soup on his lap. Felx Morsom, the ptoagonist of Felix in the Underworld is the quintessential English schlimazel. Though not a fool, Felix plays an altogether passive role as misfortune falls upon him. The strength of Mortimer's book lies in his ability to portrary Felix in a charming, almost winsome manner while at the same time moving the story ahead in a plesant fashion. Mortimer has a keen eye for detail. The book is easy to read, amusing, and charming.
__label__2 Never let me down: The Beethoven music I listen to most in my old age, played by one of the greats. Highly recommended.
__label__2 NTFS for the drive: After reading the reviews on this website I was a little apprehensive about buying this drive, but I'm glad I bought it.The drive comes installed with a FAT32 file system. FAT32 has a 2GB file size limit. This can be very limiting for backing up large files. However, I was able to format the drive easily to NTFS using the format command on the Windows XP.The drive works fine after formatting. It is very light and portable and very quiet.I just wish it came with a case.
__label__1 This was my first, and last, kellerman novel.: While the plot kept the book moving and readable, it ended quickly, poorly, and dissapointed me after 500 pages. I don't think I will pick up another kellerman novel because this one ended so poorly.
__label__1 NOT RECOMMENDED !!!!: I hate to admit it, but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on this product. The paper loading problems are real - being careful or gentle has nothing to do with it. We have had a half dozen other printers previously (non-HPs) without anywhere near the problems.About 6 months after the warranty expired, the printer totally failed. Customer Service informed me that there is no repair option, but would gladly sell me a refurb or new one in exchange. NO THANK YOU!!Not at all what I expected from HP, especially because this was not a cheap printer. I regret purchasing this HP product and will be replacing it with another brand.
__label__2 Little labels--Big dreams: This little book tells some big stories about a time before the major corporations destroyed the music. It is the history of heros and tyrants of some of the most important independent record companies ever. Without them recorded music would have never been the same. Some of the stories are a little dry but others are brillant. A good read for anyone interested in the history of records and modern music
__label__2 Impressed: Lots-O-Fun. Wood and glass toys are high quality and are a good fall back for the kids to play with they are "bored". Would buy again.
__label__2 Great for Flash, not Flash MX: After attending a Macromedia presentation on FLASH MX I was eager to get a book to learn more about it. I was familiar with Flash 5, but certainly no expert. I got this book after working with Flash MX for about one week. The first thing I noticed is the book is well written and organized. Each chapter has a project at the end that covers everything you learned in the chapter, or module. However, it looks like a book written for Flash 5 with a few, very few, comments thrown in for MX. There is only one small paragraph about the new Components in MX, a big change from Flash 5. There is nothing even mentioned about Distributing to Layers, another new and great feature of MX.I like the book and will keep it for a general reference for FLASH. However, I am looking for another book now that is specific to MX. If you are totally new to FLASH, then this is a great book. If you are looking for something with specifics to MX, look some more.
__label__2 I'd give it a 4.5...:): Definitely a great book for middles-schoolers, wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger, though. I like reading about werewolves, vampires, etc, and this was a good book.Still...Sometimes, it seemed like the adults were little more than children themselves, especially Esme. OK, granted, these are not normal people we are talking about, and it seems to fit when you remind yourself 'werewolf'. Other than that, very good character development. Would have liked to have gotten to know Gabriel more. Plot was great, even though the ending sounded slightly forced. It would also have been nice to have heard of what happened to Aiden. Somehow, the blood-chocolate connection didn't seem strong enough. Great book, unless you are squeamish, that is. >:)
__label__1 I have been using this book in class, and I am not impressed: While this book certainly covers a lot of ground, it is painfully lacking in derivations or examples. I beleive it would be a reasonable book to use (as a reference) for someone who has already mastered quantum mechanics, but it is almost impossible to learn out of. Also, if you want a very terse, yet comprehensive reference, why bother with something other than Landau?
__label__2 Educate yourself: This book helped me to understand my problems with intimacy. It made me aware of the stumbling blocks in the way. Couseling and good books to read on the subject have been so helpful. It will take time and discernment to deal with my distrust, but I want to get well and this book helped me make a plan.
__label__2 terrrific value!: 100% Cashmere ScarfI buy several of these scarves every year from this vendor. I am so pleased with the quality and beautiful colors. It is so soft. Everyone I have ever given this scarf to has been so delighted. It fun to be able to make people happy without having to spend a fortune.
__label__2 Tri-Core .. Pillow: This is an adequate well made cervical pillow. It conforms to the physicians recommendations that the head and neck should be straight in the supine position. This is why on sleeping on your side you use the pillow sides and on your back the head rests in the suppressed area. I had a mild to moderate upper cervical injury that was appreciably helped by the pillow. - J. Knox
__label__1 A little to small for blow gun.: I purchased these for my grandsons to use in their blow guns but while the regular darts snap into the mouthpiece just fine these paint balls roll out the end if blow gun is pointed down. Not really much use.
__label__2 A good listen: Listen, I will admit that the main reason we purchased Moveit Like This was because my two daughters (6 & 9) wanted it.But to my surprise it is a very enjoyable listen. The songshave a great beat and the lyrics are fun. I find myselfreaching for the CD quite often as I commute to work. Yes thesongs can be similar, but they are enjoyable and fun to listento. After hearing the album I would buy even if the kids didn'trequest.
__label__2 Love it: It is really cute in person. I just love the color. I bought it because it is the month my dog was born. So I have it on the fireplace with my husband & my birthday bear, which are different months/color.
__label__2 Air Compressor: I'm very pleased with the unit's performance and the fact it is rebuildable, though in my usage I don't forsee that need. I wish I could have had a faster shipping option because this was used on a Handi-cap van.
__label__1 temp goes up way too high: I've been using this about 3 month, and trying to figure it out why my yogurt come out curdish. Then I noticed that the temp goes up to around 130F.I tried altering by adding water, putting thinner pads, but the product is simply not good.
__label__1 Don't waste your money: This is one of the most disappointing knitting books I've come across. Most of the book is spent teaching the beginner how to knit, which I have no qualms with, except to say that there are tons of books out there that do that and do it better. There are only a few patterns in the book, none of which are original and all of which are, frankly, unattractive. There are 2 multicolor ponchos which use a variety of yarn types, but the colors used are hideous. Even when trying a project like this using leftover yarn from your stash, most of us would try to pick yarns that complement each other. The worst part of the book though is the constant name-dropping for name-dropping's sake. In many cases, the entire point of Eig's anecdotes are tell the readers how close she is with the stars. If you like the Hollywood angle, try Hollywood Knits Style by Suss Cousins for patterns that are more original.
__label__2 awsome game: I don't think the game deserves an average customer review rating of 3 so people will think it's mediocor. This is up there with the best like Grand theft auto vice city, wwe Smack Down! here comes the pain OR THE GREAT PLATFORM GAMES...The problem with this game are the graphics(aren't the best). There's the most trile and eror ever in a video game and I like that because every time I failed I couldn't wait to replay the car stunts after the anoying loading times, nobody wants to complete a game in a day. My friend who is okay at video games took 2 - 3 hours to complete a stunt(by failing alot)in the second movie(the one where you drive your car go over a roof through a chimney then through a middle of a train).People are putting it down because it's hard(this world is not made of hardcore gamers). A game that's easy(Ninja Gaidan on xbox)is being called hard and that's is wrong(except for final difficulty and people still complain over normal and hard).
__label__2 open veins of Latin America: This is a fabulous work of history. It reads like a novel so it is extremely readable. It is painful but so interesting it was hard to put down. This is the only book I have had stolen from me. (From my car!) That should tell a potential reader something.
__label__1 I want MY watch back: That's about how I felt after reading Kihn's walkabout on his experiences as a consultant. I was really looking forward to this book given Kihn's other work, but this book just misses the mark. Kihn's characterizations are good, but they wear thin fast.The book has one chapter on an offsite meeting that's hilarious, but the rest of the book is weak. It's as if Kihn didn't have enough material to write a book, so several chapters have no real reason for being in the book.Overall, the book is rambling, not particularly interesting, and lacking in a theme--even though the title suggests one. The book gets one star because of the chapter on offsites and the use of upward feedback in consulting firms. If not for that, there'd be no stars.I'd save my money and pass this one by.What's interesting is that this book had several Amazon customer reviews, but somehow they've vaporized.
__label__2 Wonderful classical guitar for student: My daughter was given this guitar by her school, which provides classical guitar lessons to all students in 3rd grade and above. It is a beautiful, high-quality instrument. We would definitely recommend it for a young student.
__label__2 One of the Best Movies I've seen in a LONG time: Signs was by far, one of the greatest movies I have seen in a LONG time. It was excellently written, and told from a point of view no other "sci-fi" movie has doen before, that of a single family experiancing the event as it was happening. It doesnt even have a clear genra either. It was part sci-fi, part thriller, part suspence all rolled into one. It was especially personal in the scene with Joaquin Phoenix sitting watching the TV waiting for something to happen. After 9/11 we all know what that feels like. This movie was down-right incredible, and anyone who didn't like it is simply retarded. Nuff said. Go out and buy this movie, it will be the best $20 you spend.
__label__1 Really bad...like all dictators: As an international affairs junkie, I was hoping for a little levity and a lot of laughter with this film. This DICTATOR like all dictators was a total failure. I love Bruno and Borat and Ali G, but simply The DICTATOR and Baron Cohen was a real disappointment and a total waste of time. My wife began reading her Kindle half way into the film, and I powered through hoping for a laugh...it did not happen. The idea of the movie is more funny than the actually movie. SBC really lost his edge on this one.
__label__1 TINY!!: This thing is seriously SMALL. I guess I just didn't realize that 1 1/2 quarts was such a small amount, but WOW it's really tiny. This is probably only good for someone who only cooks for themselves. Maybe I'll use this someday for some fondue or something....
__label__1 3D: difficult, dumb and disasterous: What a colossal waste. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't pay 5 cents for this program. Possibly the worst job of programming I've ever experienced. Graphics are a joke, tools are inexplicable and the help features are useless. Need I say more?
__label__2 Who knew?: Who knew Hutch could sing? Well, I've been listening to Mr Soul since I was a boy; the only fault is "Playing To An Audience Of One" is missing from this compilation, too bad. I still have the 8 track somewhere....Way to go Hutch!
__label__1 BOOO: as soon as you finish a mission it send to back to the main Menue you can not contiue. i WOULd not recomend this product i just bought it
__label__2 UNBELIEVEABLE!: Wow. Thats all I can say! When I read my first book by Mr. Card at 11, Enders Game, I thought I had found the best sci-fi book ever (and I was a sci-fi junkie!). Then, 2 years later I was hunting around for something to read, and I came across Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind. I went crazy. I bought all three, and went home to read them Speaker of the Dead instantly became my favorite book. The beginning, just the first 10 pages, was pretty boring, nothing like Enders Game, but after that I couldn't put it down. All of the characters touched me, especially Miro and Ouanda, Libo and Novinha. The piggies were so wonderful, and their secret was truly worth the wait! This book is worth it's cost one-million-fold, and its sequels only get better. Read!
__label__1 Paper does not feed usually: I've had this for months, and it will not print unless one pushed the paper in a sheet at a time. It tries to pull the paper in, fails, then signals a jam. If one opens/closes the front cover it'll try again after 10 seconds of whirring--this give you enough time to get your fingers under the next sheet of paper so you can push it in manually. If you don't it'll usually get the paper after 2 additional tries (ie it fails, you open/close the cover it tries again).It's quick, IF it's not in powersave mode (it almost always is unless you're printing out a batch of stuff. It's output is fine. But I cannot tolerate a printer that must be babysat--worse because it's shared on my network and I'm usually nowhere it.
__label__1 Disappointed in Florida: The reading was difficult, too technical for the normal lay person. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this book to those who read to ENJOY a book and learn from it. I did order two other toddler books at the same time I bought this one and I am enjoying them thoroughly and have gotten some quite useful information from them.
__label__1 Cd doesn't work: The cd isn't scratched or anything.it looks brand new but it skips and freezes over and over again.i was so excited to receive this cd and watch my favorite soap opera of all time but it kept skipping.i was disappointed.i ordered two and both of them didn't work properly
__label__2 It works. Period.: I don't know a crap ton about HDMI, but all I know is that this works with the varying devices I've tried it with. I've actually bought 2 of these and never had a problem with either one.
__label__2 MAKE NO MISTAKE...: don't believe what they wrote about this movie. I don't care if it's not perfect, or the greatest social commentary of the day. It is damn fun to watch. Sure, I really don't think that dropping an anchor like that would work, or that ships going into reverse that quickly, but you know what? I don't care. I still found myself whooping and hollering when the bad aliens got there just desserts. It is also a warning to one and all that just because we can do something, like sending a message to outer space, doesn't necessarily mean we should. We might not like the answer.
__label__2 Sturdy Watch for child: I was a little disappointed when I found out AFTER ordering that this was a woman's watch. It came up in a search for children's watches. Still, it does fit my 11 year old well and she uses it everyday. It is nice and sturdy and so far I haven't found anything wrong with it.
__label__1 A promising subject that didn't deliver: While I was hoping for a guide to assist in reducing many expenses the book was a recap of one family's methods of scrimping and saving that were not applicable to me. While I do appreciate the statements such as "while our kids didn't always have the latest jeans or sneakers like their friends they will always have memories of our many trips to Europe" I just wasn't motivated to try these tricks. At times I envisioned that the family lived in very close quarters, driving a very old car (Chevette-like), and having mac'n'cheese for dinners. I do have to congratulate the author for making this lifestyle work for him.
__label__2 Great camera for the money: Compact and great options for smaller camera. I like the design better than Sony cameras and gave up on Sony after 3 of the later models died on us in a matter of 3 years and we hardly used them!
__label__1 WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ: it was just bland and boring, thats all, the plot was ok, but not worth reading. the only reason i'd buy is so that i could use it for scrap paper, or maybe for oragami. otehr than that, its honestly useless.
__label__1 Um...........huh?: I always wondered why this movie tanked at the box office. Now I know. This floundering animated feature from Disney should never have been let out of the vaults. One of the sub-plots concerns a clairvoyant pig, (!!!) who apparently can foretell the future by sticking it's head in a bowl of water. (How's that again???) Too frightening for children, and too ridiculous for adults, it's unclear which audience this movie was supposed to target. And then there's "Gurgi", one of the most annoying creations ever in an animated film........(let's not even go into that one.....) Your money would be much better spent on one of Disney's tried and true classics; certainly not on this drivel.
__label__2 4 stars: This is a fantastic story that got held back by the romance. A lot of the romance is weird too, and can be a book deal breaker for some romance fans but I suggest trying it anyway.Annie is a normal healthy girl but gets a fever as a child that leaves her deaf. Her family thinks she is mad and hides her in shame and abuses her (in an ambiguously villainous way). When she is 20 a local man violently rapes her and leaves her pregnant. Her story and perspective was so interesting and really sets this book apart from the genre. I wish the her POV was either the only one or wasn't included at all; that would have added greatly to the drama and development.
__label__2 Best Show Ever: I love this show and by far this is the season that I would call my favorite. I had to purchase it so that I could watch all the fun of this season over and over. I love the fact that this show shows the reality of crab fishing and what happens while they are out on the sea. I am very happy that I chose to get this from Amazon because I have never had a problem before and this was just perfect. I would recommend buying this from Amazon to anyone who would ask where they can get it at a great price. Even buying it on the used site, I would highly recommend because everything has been perfect in the past with that.
__label__2 British Science Fiction At Its Best!: Watch a fine cast of English actors keep up stylish upper lips as they confront a mass impregnation by fierce aliens. It's the original film adaptation of the book "The Midwich Cuckoos."
__label__2 Heartbreaking: I had no idea that this movie would be as powerful as it was. I could sense from the bucolic and happy beginning that doom was in the air. Especially because this film is set in Paris during the German occupation. Doom becomes reality. Yet this story is told so perfectly and truthfully that I couldn't help but be swept up. Gorgeously made and acted. Bravo to all involved.
__label__1 Both cats refuse to ingest it: I tried the full 1/4 tsp dose mixed into the cats' favorite wet food. They wouldn't go near it. Then I halved the dosage for kitties (works out to 1/8th teaspoon) mixed into an entire can (5.5oz) of wet food that my kitties adore. They won't go near it.I tried it on their dry food. They won't go near it.The only way I can get it into them is to mix it with water and force feed it via pet syringe. I don't know about yours, but my cats don't like this at all. They will hide from anyone who comes near in fear that they'll get picked up and dosed. So, you trade good urine pH for your cat's trust.
__label__2 Reality Transporter: The book is really interesting and fascinating. You will get hunger for more. While you read the book, it's like you're living the adventure of the characters, it trasportates you to the books reality.
__label__2 Thank you VW commercials!: I admit that I had not heard of Nick Drake before VW used "Pink Moon" on their lastest commercial. The song moved me so much when I saw the commercial I was driven to find out who the artist was. This album is nothing short of fantastic. My only complaint is the short length. If you are a fan of "Red House Painters" then you will love Nick Drake's music also. I was amazed to discover that the album was released in 1972. My next purchase will be his box set. His music takes you to another world.
__label__2 Negro it's an artist!: To mix some songs togheter and make a Cd it's a very simple job, but do it in a professional way...it's another story!Joey Negro it's a famous DJ, and in this CD you can find it's attitude:Simple way to make good music.Here there isn't a reserch of new sound, only reserch of good music to listen and to dance.All togheter he create an athmopsphere: DANCE WITH JOY.From the first song (IT'S YOURS) you have the feeling of the rythm that in the CD it's going from Soul to Funky with just a little of Jazz and Disco.Aquela Esquina, Storm and Inspired are very great songs, but all the general level it's very up...up up and Dance.
__label__2 Eerie and Satisfying: Just as the movie leaves you wanting to talk to someone else about their interpretation, the music too leaves much up to you. Calming and discomforting at the same time this soundtrack is the perfect mix to relax to on one of those not so normal days. The melodies and rythms bring back many memories from the film, ideas which are perfectly represented in the music. I highly reccomend this if you enjoyed the movie and want to have one more thing to remember it by. It reminds me greatly of the Thomas Newman score that accompanied American Beauty.
__label__2 The old standby for daily meditation: The "little black book" is one of the most trusted, helpful brief devotionals of the recovery movement. Useful to both AA and NA members and ever those still struggling with active addiction, "24-Hours a Day" is a wonderful way to begin each new day with a useful reminder of God's goodness.
__label__2 Works great for us!: As owners of 4 vehicles, this was a great option for us. It stays in place and can be moved from car to car easily. It has never slipped under any circumstances. Good price too.
__label__2 Another winner: I think what bugs me most, is that Savage is often labeled as right wing or some other foolish title. He's just common sense with decency, all blended together. This, and every other book he has written speaks nothing but the truth. Great, great read.
__label__2 Herron never disappoints!: I've read Rita Herron's romantic suspense, paranormal, and contemporary novels. She always creates a great plot and more importantly a hero and heroine that I can truly root for! Talk about a woman willing to take matters into her own hands to make sure she gets the HEA she deserves. With a brave heart, good friends, a great sense of humor and the right guy, Maddie totally deserved finding love in the end. Another wonderful story!
__label__1 This author doesn't practive what he preaches: This author is allegedly extemely dishonest. Sometimes examining situations reveals they are not what they seem to be, but this man who claims he worships the Lord from my personal experence is crooked.
__label__2 The Vow: Speaking from a stand point of a recovering brain paitient... I feel as though the book, was amazing. I could identify so much with this story.It really opened my eyes to see from the point of view of what my husband goes through as he is my care taker! Even if I can't help the things that I do or say at certain moments later I can go back and give him a hug and thank him for always being there. For being a rock through all of this. Thank you for the courage to share your story to help others!!!
__label__2 smallville so far: i am a big fan of this show a big super man fan even more and everything theyve done couldnt have seen it done any other way im not a big comic book person mom never let me collect them but what i do know is the original movies are good but the stories were nowhere compared to this show the new movie i didnt like at all but i hear that lana has her own comic so i think it was important to keep her on the show for as long as they did im anxious to get the louis and clarke mess rolling cause u know theres going to be lots of laughs and i hope they keep this show going for along time even if they have a bad season or two bc 2 many shows r getting cancelled for the reason that people who rate good shows bad bring them down so i hope it keeps going like its going so we can keep enjoying this great show bc it hs great story lines good characters and so far a good record knock on wood
__label__1 POOR QUALITY: Ordered this due to positive reviews from others. Product arrived damaged. Red wire was not connected on one of the adapters. Poor quality with power adapter for SATA connection. At $16.99 and free shipping, I guess you get what you pay for.Many thanks to Amazon for their 5 star customer service.
__label__2 Cards are a real blessing!: I pull an angel card every morning & read about the special energies my angel of the day has in store for me. It helps me focus on something positive everyday. It gives me a higher direction for my energies. I am finding that big changes are taking place in my life as a result of this set.
__label__1 A little less than was expected: This is not bad for an amateur type video. I had expected a more professional production to be on sale at Amazon, well I guess I learnt something too. One cannot take away from the fact that the hunting trip recorded is a remarkeable achievement and I am envious particularly since I live in the southern hemisphere and a long way from Alaska. A great story but the production quality is not up to the same standard.
__label__1 boring: Very corny and boring. Also the narators voice is anoying. Also has a ton of plot holes and the over all plot is hard to follow
__label__1 unbelievable: bought this battery in Jan 2011. used it minimally. completely died last week. wont even take a charge. no life at all. so had the battery for 16 months total, 4 months after manufacturer warranty expired. emailed them explaining that is must be a flook, that theres no way they sell crap batteries such as this and they said sorry a years up.heres the emailMe:bought battery last year and it just quite on me this week...after minimal use. I realize theres probably only a one year manufacturers warranty on it but these batteries last alot longer than a little over a year. was wondering if i could return battery for a new one as i suspect this particular one that i received was a defective one and a flook and doesnt represent all the batteries you carry. please let me know what steps to take to get this battery replaced.thank you.The Battery Geeks response:I am sorry for the inconvenience of the battery. We do only warranty the battery for 1 year free replacement.Thank you!TBG
__label__1 Mobile stops turning: This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways. I liked to idea, but just doesn't work. This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round. The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck". We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store. (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.)
__label__1 NOT for a karaoke machine but great music: Disney Karaoke, Vol. 3This CD is WILL NOT show lyrics on a karaoke screen. It is great if all you want is music. We bought it for a birthday party for my daughter in which karaoke was the main attraction. This CD has a booklet of tiny words with the lyrics. It WILL NOT show up on a karaoke screen. VERY disappointing.
__label__2 Nice: I bought my infant son a pirate costume for his first Halloween this year and I knew that I wanted to dress up with him in a matching costume but didn't want to spend a fortune. When I found this costume, I knew I had found "the one". Good looking and super affordable? Yes please!When I finally got my package, I immediately tried it on. The top fits great but it shows quite a bit of your belly, which I didn't like since I still have a bit of extra weight leftover from my pregnancy. The skirt part was a bit too big/too loose for me. Since the top was a little too short on me, I pulled the skirt over my belly to cover it up and tied the sash around my waist like in the stock photo and it worked out quite well. It helped keep the too big skirt on and also helped hide my belly more.The material the costume is made out of produces a lot of static so you definitely want to take care of that before the big night out. Overall, this was a good purchase and I can't wait to wear it on Halloween.
__label__2 Great Book: I loved my book so much I ordered my Mother one. All vitamin books are informative. This one is informative up to date gives advice and has a wealth of information. It gives everything you need to know about most vitamins and supplements. SOme amazing facts and well thought out and written well and broken down for basic and advanced information. Its just a great book! It also has suggestions for hair skin and nails and pretty much every body part inside and out. It has alot of Q&A and alot of myth busters. Just a really great reference book. You really have to read many vitamin books and research many studies and plan your vitamins and supplements according to your diet weight and age and lifestyle. Never just listen to one Doctor or one book. Take the time to research it all and come up with a plan that works for you. Alot of supplements mentioned in this book for weight loss I have tried and lost 25lbs, by doing nothing!
__label__2 HDMI Switcher: Excellent product but incompatible with my HDMI switcher. Having only one HDMI output on my big screen TV, I was relying on my switcher but it did not work at all. Now I'm having to plug and unplug my HD DVD player.
__label__2 fantasy but fun: Predictable but allowable. One falls right into the trap of this romantic and fabulous film starring two most amazing film stars from another era. It was great to see Vanessa Redgrave looking so attractive as a mature woman. Ditto for Franco Nero. Its is especially intriguing to know that they were once married in the real world. This film is pure fantasy and fun. Nothing deep to talk about over the water cooler but nevertheless, charming.
__label__2 Only on vinyl?: I have this on vinyl, and cannot for the life of me understand why it isn't available on cd.A very soulful album, with the standout track being Willie Nelson's "Always On My Mind", which is taken slowly and has got to be the most soulful version I have ever heard of this song.Please release this on cdMike Rossiter UK
__label__2 Easy to install and use: I've been using this product for 2 months now. The installation was simple and the instructions on programming and use straight-forward, although it has a lot more features than I use. The temperature sensor seems accurate.Update: After 2 years now, this product is still working great.
__label__2 The Book of Fate: A little slow at the very beginning, but I soon couldn't put it down. A lot of twists and turns. I enjoyed reading this on my iPad so that I could jump to the Internet to look up things. I had to look up a map of Sandusky, Ohio when I learned it was laid out similar to Washington D.C. If you love history this is a good one. The final player was unexpected, but I don't want to give anything away, just read it.
__label__1 An example of disorganization: You'll spend most of your time waiting for something to happen. There is essentially no connection between the CD-ROM and the text.
__label__2 Excellent item: Even at the lowest volume level, my Shure E4C earphones are too loud for me when I am listening to music in quiet environments. This level attenuator does an excellent job of decreasing the volume. No static is heard when adjusting the volume. Also, the volume between the two earphones remains balanced at even the lowest levels.The instructions state that this is intended for use on airplanes only but I have not had any problems using this with my iPod nano.
__label__1 Another Gift that was Unappreciated: I ordered KINGDOM CROWN for my husband, who is an avid reader. I never read the book. When I asked him for a review, he couldn't remember the book, so I gather it wasn't very well written or interesting.
__label__1 Superficial book: I like Chinese kung-fu very much. But this book isn't the sort of stuff that will appeal to me, for it's very superifical, without touching on the deep and varied tradition of the martial arts.
__label__2 Great book in mint condition: Book memorializes May 2, 1986 across America...on an ordinary day! I bought this book for my daughter who was born May 3, 1986...great coffee table book for her.
__label__2 A Very Solid Introductory Textbook: We have used this textbook in our 9th Grade Global Studies course with good results. Within each unit it provides an overview of geography, ancient heritage, independence movements, and modern developments for the regions of Africa, all parts of Asia, Latin America, Europe & the Former Soviet Union, and The Middle East. Each chapter is divided into sections - each with preview & review questions, vocabulary, etc. We do supplement this text with enrichment readings, but we have found it to provide a solid foundation for the year-long course.
__label__1 Overrated.: To be able to sing "much" and "well" are not the same thing. Ms. Cassidy was a singer, that's for sure, but a good one she was not. This disk is flat, both in song value and production, her voice is overblown and dosen't fit this music at all. At best, it's a must-hear to her friends and family. At the worst, it's a painful cover album lacking all the things that makes a good album worth while.
__label__2 GREAT PRODUCT: at just under 16lbs this UPS handles everything you can throw at it. This unit replaced my dying APC smart-ups 1000. It's well worth buying a new UPS at $109 vs spending $129 for a replacement battery on my old APC unit. The digital display will attract alot of us that like to see what the unit is doing. In all this is a great prodcut for a great price.
__label__2 Fresh insight and observation: I am re-reading "Buck Naked Faith" now, and I am just as engaged as the first time. I find myself saying, "Yeah, that's right" or "Humph" often because Sandras crystallizes age old (and new) spiritual insight on subjects often thought about by many.I recommend this book for just about any person over the age of about thirteen or fourteen. There are some adult situations discussed, but nothing gratuitous.You will be challenged when you read this book.
__label__2 Too short: The game is good but it is too short. I finished the game in three days. I expected it to be a little longer. 8(
__label__2 Incredibly Helpful: Speak Out! is a well written book that is easy to read for anyone, young or old, that wants to improve their critical thinking skills. Beginning debaters learn how to form good arguments and experienced debaters learn how to fine tune their points. It also helps the classroom teacher or debate coach teach logical and critical thinking skills in concrete, step-by-step ways. As a debate coach, this book helps me simplify basic debate techniques and advance returning debater's skills. As an art teacher, I teach my students how to find evidence within artworks to support their opinions...they have no idea they are being taught debate skills. Overall, this book benefits anyone who wants to improve their debate techniques or is working with people who are.
__label__2 For the serious student: This book is a collection of studies by several different authors on various aspects of Tolkien's work. It covers territory beyond The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion. For full appreciation of this collection, a knowledge of The Lost Road and The Notion Club Papers (found in Sauron's Defeat) from the History of Middle-earth series are necessary, at the very least. Familiarity with the terminology of grammar and linguistics is helpful. There are references to King Lear, Sir Orfeo, and the Finnish Kalevala. Non English quotations are well glossed. This book is for the serious student of Tolkien's writing style. In spite of its challenges, I found it fascinating and finished all except the Sir Orfeo chapter on the day that I received the book. The 4 star rating reflects the degree to which this is a specialist's book.
__label__2 "Family" in a...box....: Please know that Soul Food is Still in...in 2010....Excellent!!!! the whole series! and the whole cast! ...they all felt like family to me....I hope they bring all of them back...they have done it with the show.....("The Game"!) now on BET....maybe BET can bring back a show that we all! love and crave...smile...Anyone from BET Listening????? I'm praying so.To all the cast we miss and love you all....someone please put a buzz in...BET's ear thank you and God bless you all.
__label__1 horrible: Do not spend your money for this book. It is worthless. It is boring. It is bad written. There are other better books out there for the same ammount of money. It was a sad experience to look trhough this book, I sent it right back. I cannot believe that any person who can read and had read books in his/ her life would find this book decent. It is that bad. It has some rediculous ideas how to intertain your child. They are plain stupid. This book is embarrasing.
__label__1 dryingg: iv been using it for a few weeks and it hasnt done my hair any favors. if anything its made my hair dryer and harder to deall with. the chemical shampoos were more moisturizing than this.I have curly hair with some frizz.
__label__2 A Magnificent Read!: I really did not have any idea what I was getting into when I opened my Kindle to this story. What I found was an inspirational story that leads one to reevaluate their life and that of what is most important to them.This is a very fast read and at only 146 pages it is also very short leading the reader longing for more. Lewis uses his infamous fable abilities to transform our vision of Heaven and Hell by a simple bus ride and visitors from our past. For better or for worse we have to accept the Gift that has been given to us and we have to do this on His terms not ours.
__label__2 Yes does its job: First time buying thermal paste so I can't compare it to anything else but it does its job, CPU runs at 30C
__label__2 How do I unsubscribe to Vegetarian times?: Although I think Vegetarian Times is a very worthwhile magazine, I would like to unsubscribe to it as I am not able to cook any more.Please take me off your list. It is unacceptable to have to receive something just because I am on some "automatic subscriber's" list. I have had enough issues to last a lifetime.Thank you.
__label__1 noisy, failed after 4 months, does help with commercials: I hooked this between my sat receiver and television. It did wonders with reducing commercial volume to normal levels, but had an annoying whine in the background noticable during quiet portions of the shows. Unit then died after 4 months of use, even though connected to surge protector. Don't plan to buy a replacement.
__label__1 Not too well suited for beginners although intended.: The book covers the basics of object oriented programming and C++. The book is very theoretical and together with the long code samples you are being put away from your originally idea of fully understanding how to program. You learn the object concept and then you use C++ to implement that concept. I read Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days by Jesse Liberty, and then this book. I understood this book, but lots of my schoolmaids had difficulties understanding it, probably because they didn't read "21 Days" first. The book is intended to teach C++ from scratch, but you have to be academically intelligent to really grasp the C++ language as it is presented in the book. The book is probably the right choice if you want information about the object concept and C++ in that context, but to my oppinion it needs to be more concrete in presenting the programming language. NOT A REALLY BAD BOOK THOUGH !
__label__2 Works from all directions: I thought this remote control would only let me use it in front of the camera, but it works the same from all directions, being behind, to the sides or above. It works perfect. When working on "bulb" speed on my D90, it lets you open the shutter pressing once, and to close the shutter, pressing for the second time. I made pictures of the "super moon" one month ago using a very frim tripod and 300 mm and this time my camera did not move at all. Now i have a very sharp image of the moon thanks to this remote control.
__label__1 not what expected?: This small tome was not what was expected, with rather superficial musings about topics that deserved a more thoughtful and provocative approach... all in all a disappointment.
__label__2 Perfect replacement part for my old garage door opener: I noticed that my garage door wouldn't go down and one of the sensor's led was off. I checked with Sears. Their replacement part plus extravagant shipping and handling would make it a better value to simply replace the whole garage door opener with a new one.My web search revealed this Company's part which turns out is the identical replacement part at a reasonable price. I let my 18 year old do the replacement hook up, which took about 20 minutes (we took our time). Works like new now.
__label__1 Got cut on the metal lip!: Heats fine - but I cut my finger on the very sharp metal on the pouring spout. Not worth it. I've too many other family members who also use it. I was replacing another kettle that I'd had for 4 years which is no longer made. Guess I'll have to keep looking. What I really want is one of the variable temp ones that is also suitable for green teas as well as the higher temps for black teas.
__label__1 Poor acting, dialogue, and plotting ruin this movie: This movie could have been so much better had it not pretended to have content. As a no-brain action flick, it can entertain, but getting through the often painful dialogue and pretentious plot take too long. To enjoy this movie, rent it and play Mystery Science Theater 2000 with a group of friends. END
__label__1 Ghost Adventures: season Three: I think it's a big rip off that they have show's from Season Two on Season Three!! Check it out before you buy!! Pennhurst School, Ohio Reformatory and more!! And they over use the white laser lights for ORBS get real guys!!
__label__1 Terrible Book: Allen knows zilch about the Balkans, knows nothing about the war, prattles on incessantly about herself. Seems she heard some horrifying stories of mass rapes from acquaintances and decided to write about how bad that made her feel. That's it. If you care about that, then this book is for you.
__label__2 Sansa's not bad!: Nice little player, with only slight difficulties of deleting music and creating playlists. Definitely worth the money.
__label__2 Schoenhut 25 key Elite Spinet with bench: I boughter for my daughters both love music and dance. I found in online web. They don't know how to play yet but they tried to learn by themself and like so much it's good product. Good for young age. [ASIN: Schoenhut 25 key Elite Spinet with Bench ]
__label__1 I was duped into buying this one.....it's just not that good: The sound and picture quality of this dvd is poor, which really disappointed me. I was on a waiting list to purchase this one, and I can honestly say that it was NOT worth the wait....or the price I paid for it.
__label__2 how strong is love?: I have to admit that I decided to read this book on account of the very angry review by Mr. Huebner. I'm glad I did. It's a good book. Really made me think. I could understand why Mr. Heubner was upset upon receiving a poor printing of a book that he thought was about a totally different subject; but was the book moronic? In my opinion, it is anything but moronic. I wish I had a book club to discuss the philosophical issues emerging from this wonderful story.It begins with a young woman (Valerie) asking a successful upper class artist (Louis) whether he needs a model. As you can imagine, they fall in love.This book is not an easy read; there are too many monologues and descriptions. But it was fascinating to read about Louis and Valerie's love for each other and the sacrifices they are willing to make. I would appreciate anyone's theory on the title of the book. I'm not sure what it's supposed to mean. See? I need that book club for feedback.- posted by Poore Richard's wyfe
__label__1 A Major Buffett Of B.S.: This dude sold the publisher a bill of goods and recieved a nice payday for it. A scammer he sure is.Regarding Benny "Lefty Guns Ruggerio" his facts are totally wrongHe states Benny needed 50,000 to getout from under gambling debt to be made...well my friend...benny was a made guy long before his gaming debts! this guy is a real mutt! He worked for every family in New York ? yeah ok.......A free agent? yeah ok.....Seems like the public is crying for any OC material...this dudefilled the void....
__label__2 revisting my childhood: I had already seen this movie in the past, the fact that I had a "craving" to see it again should say something! It is a chick flick there is a ditzy blonde character nothing more than a light fun comedy to relax..........
__label__1 changed ending: I do not like the new ending. I prefered the one in the movie where the dragon comes back to Donkey. If I had known this was cut out I would not have bought the DVD.
__label__2 THIS BOOK IS THE BOMB!!!!!!: I love this book is filled with adventures of little cute Fudge. This book make me love reading, I love all the adventures that Peter and Fudge had,I hope they would be more book's about Fudge and Peter.
__label__1 lasted 10 minutes: Lasted ten minutes before the gears started to strip. Now it makes bad noises and vibrates funny. I'd hold off on this one.
__label__2 Secretariat (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo): Very pleased with product. Although 2 days later I saw it advertised at BestBuy for $2 less. Still I am very pleased.
__label__2 POWER RANGERS: This was the first power rangers ep ever. If you are buying this copy for the first box art then do it. But if you are looking to buy this because you just wanted to see the ep then you should look for the CLASSIC RED RANGER tape. You get two ep for less. You get this ep Day of the Dumpster and The Wannabe Ranger.
__label__1 disappointing: I wanted this book to be great, but it isn't. Packed with pointless detail, blind heresay and pop psychology, the author postures and predicts in an overbearing and irritating way. Coupled with the fact that Morrissey was not involved with the writing of this book and has subsequently called for Rogan's head, I felt disloyal reading this book and it left a sour taste in my mouth. Rogan claims to be a Smith's devotee and yet has painted Morrissey as a neurotic, control freak.
__label__2 Does the job: What do you want? It covers the rear of lens. Nice to have a couple around so you don't have to dig in the bag for a cap.
__label__2 Blue: Great corn meal at a reasonable price...works well for tortilla and fish batter...Watch out if you use it for frying b/c some people aren't ready for the blue'ish color in their fish batter, but its great!!
__label__2 I've tried everything: I have been seeing a dermatologist for about 12 years and have tried so many prescriptions for my acne that I can't even count. Recently my MD asked if I would like to participate in a clinical study for this product and I gave it a shot. At first my skin got very chapped, but that went away. Honestly it took 10-12 weeks for my skin to get really clear, but I was getting the product for free, so I stuck with it. Now, my skin is smoother and clearer than it has been in years. The only other treatment that has ever been this effective for me is Accutane which has many more risks and side effects. I normally wouldn't spend this much on skin care, but once it started working, I stopped caring about the cost. I will continue to use it.The 3 piece sets have lasted 2.5-3 months for me.
__label__1 Campaigns ONLY: I bought this book with the starcraft battle chest and I must say that this book is not very good. It is okay to use it for campaigns, but for custom games, it's horrible. Either the strategies are to basic, or they don't work. You'll find your self saying "Wow, thank you captin obvious." If you like to play capaigns, then you may want this book because it helps you a little bit. If you're like me and like to play custom games or have little intrests in campaigns, look elsewhere.
__label__1 Good Hardware, Hideous Software: This was my first digital camcorder. I'm not a videophile, just wanted to take some simple video of the family. The camera seems to be perfect for me. Unfortunately, the software is unusable which makes the camera almost worthless. Sony, get it together. Your hardware is good...but I need the software too. Google "Handycam Software Problems" before buying any Sony Handycam product.
__label__2 Good price for Frontline: We have 4 dogs and live on acreage....lots of bugs this year and I rely on this product. Works well! And this price is really good.
__label__2 Useful for ideas: Maybe not the best possible book in the world, but the only one like it I've found.
__label__2 Wonderful Music: I had enjoyed this album of piano music years ago on a cassette tape. I wondered where I might find a copy of the music on CD. Amazon came through with a used copy. It took a couple of weeks to get it, but I have really enjoyed having the music once again. Because it is a 22 year old CD, I had to tag it manually for album art and information, but that is to be expected. The music is great for late night relaxing and stress reduction.
__label__1 No Coperation- defective merchandise: I bought this & the adapter part did not work- I used the small card in my son's adapter & it worked- I emailed & asked for a new adapter- NO NEW ADAPTER!! I was very disappointed. I did not want to return the entire item because only the adapter did not work-
__label__1 Fantastic book....: until the conclusion. I really thought this was one of the finest books I've ever read until I reached the conclusion. The ending was so complicated and bizarre I couldn't understand it. This was definitely one of the strangest books I've read in that regard.The beginning of the book was so good that I had to give it a fair grade.
__label__1 SWANN DIVE: Told by Swann Tech Support that their 2.4 Ghz wireless camera inside an average house would need a booster antenae to eliminate the interference. Bought this antenae and still got interference, so I called tech support and was then told their wireless camera system is not labeled correctly and it is unsuitable for use inside or in an urban area, because it gets interference from cell phones, microwaves, wireless phones and cable television. Swann tech support lied about needing this device, and it did not help at all to avoid interference or get a better image.
__label__1 Total Disappointment: This "talking head" video covers all the topics of boating, but provides little or no useful information you can take with you on the water. It is well produced but void of real content. I was very disappointed in it and would not recommend its purchase to anyone.The format throughout is a woman lecturing. She does a fine job of reading the scripts, but I expected much more from a DVD. Topics like trailering, docking, knots, navigation, and more would have been excellent if actual video of boats had been used to demonstrate. Instead, its just 3 hours of a nice lady lecturing, and a few marginally useful graphics. This DVD is little more than a book read onto a DVD and much less useful than a book.I'm still looking for a good DVD or video that demonstrates boating tips, as such a video would be very useful to beginners or others.
__label__1 very disappointed: The charm itself was acceptable, however, due to the lack of care involved when packaging this item, the chain arrived to me knots and broken beyond repair. The chain arrives coiled up in a little pouch. For such a fragile chain, this is definitely a necklace that needs to be secured in a box, not coiled up in a small pouch where it will likely get in knots. The chain was broken and useless, i had to return it, and just purchase a new chain locally, as this was suppose to be a Christmas gift.
__label__1 It was a fast read, not high literature: It was a fast read. A lot of dialogue over vines and what to do. I actually was somewhat mildly surprised at the ending. It was good to lay outside in the sun, read this book and veg out. Not a book or story you would want to save or reflect on its virtues later. I felt that this book, The Prey, and Deep Water were all about same.
__label__2 Traveling Singing Man: WOW!!! This one is pure magic. Justin has clearly done his homework in studying Johnny Bush. The duets are tight and wonderful and Dicky Overby and Rick Price do things with a pedal steel that will make you swoon. The material is classic with a wonderful twist. If you're a Johnny Bush fan, a Mel Tillis fan or just a fan of traditional country music this cd will become a favorite in your collection. I keep one in the car, one in the office and one at home. Enjoy...this one's a keeper.Christina - Colorado.
__label__2 The Dark Side, Indeed: Seymour Hersh, one of America's most respected journalists, and a Pulitzer Prize winner, does his homework here in exposing the Kennedy presidency. He carefully researches and documents the exploits of JFK and the Kennedy family, from the numerous sexual conquests (JFK makes Bill Clinton look like a boy scout) to Kennedy's political errors, including the failed assassination of Fidel Castro, the Bay of Pigs, the October missle crisis, and the Kennedy family's involvement with organized crime. Kennedy lovers won't like it, but everything is carefully footnoted and documented. A well written book and highly recommended.
__label__2 Great book!: I think this is a great book for anyone who might suspect they have endo or was just diagnosed with it. It was a great read lots of info!
__label__1 Not our favorite Dora DVD....: My daughter has more Dora DVD's than I would care to admit. This one is not her favorite. As a matter of fact she never requests it. Come to think of it, it's not my favorite either.I much prefer Dora's Rhymes & Riddles or Map Adventures to this one....
__label__2 Intellectual Journalism: The title is descriptive--these are adventures, not investigations. Levy writes about encounters he has had with the many characters of French high-culture, he met so-and-so at a book signing, or in a cafe, this is what they said to each other, and how it was surprising, or disappointing. These encounters are entry-points for meditations on the larger political involvements of these thinkers. This is in no way a comprehensive history, but rather a series of snapshots, mostly embarrassing for those pictured. A good read, but almost gossipy in tone; this book is intended only for those who already have opinions about the people and ideas being discussed.
__label__1 Gasket for 4 qt. Mirro pressure cooker: Gasket wouldn't seal at all. Waste of time effort and money! Will not be ordering again.Gasket was way too narrow.
__label__2 Hilarious, from a certain point of view: If you have any retail background or sales experience and can handle the overt bigotry and foul language, watch this movie. I can't remember the last time I laughed so strongly watching something. It's audacious, but that's a big part of its charm. How did I come upon this film? My sales manager let me borrow it. It's just that tuned into what the car business feels like at times - but, of course, is nowhere near an accurate representation of current practices... I hope.
__label__1 Stop!! Don't waste your time on this book.: I was terribly disappointed with this book. I read it because I have lived in western PA all my life. There are very few local references, and they aren't really part of the story at all. This book could be set anywhere. It was full of depressed, violent, angry people who are overlooked and manipulated by "the system". The characters in this book are very shallow, and their decisions are predictable. I enjoy a wide variety of books, but this one is one I wish I hadn't wasted my time on. This is the first "Oprah's picks" book I have read and I doubt that I will read anything she recommends in the future.
__label__1 Short handles!: Be prepared to kick the back wheels. I'm only 5'5". Very disappointing. Also, you have to use your hand(s) to fold it.
__label__1 Illustrated? If that's what you want to call it....: First of all, I must say that Leroux's original novel is a bit of an obsession with me, so whenever I find another edition, illustrated or otherwise, I buy it. It's my "Catcher in the Rye" as it were...so when I found this "illustrated" edition...I jumped on it and bought it. I was truly disappointed with the pictures...I've seen better art from Jr. High students. Who would put such garbage in their book? Not only were the pictures poor...so was the "abridged" text. If you want a "simplified" version to read...read Lowell Bair's adapted version.Poor take on The Phantom of the Opera...and only a good copy to put in one's "Phantom of the Opera Library" should you be a hardcore fan that must have every edition published (as I do).
__label__1 It Made Me Laugh!: I'm not the complete expert, but I favor technical analysis over fundamental analysis. This book, however, is so flawed that it would drive the uninitiated away from tech analysis. The errors and the grammar mistakes are inexcusable, particularly in a book priced like this. The author misconstrues most of the conventional knowledge in the field, and attempts some odd pastiche of research to no avail. An avalanche of charts, provided with no meaning or context. The author reminds me of the grade school student, faced with a baffling essay question, who begins flailing with his shovel, hoping to unearth some nugget of meaning. The author here, sadly, did not strike gold.
__label__2 Great Bible for weak eyes!: I ordered this for my neighbor, who has macular generation, and she wanted one with factory indexed. So I found one through your advertising and she loves it. Thank you for letting me return it. The extra super print makes it very readable. Martha
__label__1 What you would expect: This book was rarely accurate and hardly worth the time I took reading it. Preaching from a single-minded point of view, the author professes to understand a culture and institution where she is an outsider. Having experienced The Citadel experience first hand, I can assure you it is one that is not easily explained to the outsider. Perhaps I am being a bit harsh, but quite a few of the points made in this book reflect upon a mind set that I can not comprehend. Read for yourselves, but I also implore you to keep an open mind about a school that has produced some of the finest patriots of the United States.
__label__2 brilliance: ok, i dont know why im trying to do this but here goes anyhow. of course, this is the greatest album to be released since aenima, and of course im going to say that. beyond that though, there lies some totally interesting and suprising music (even for tool) which is rather shocking in the music industry today as some of us may know. there is no one, and i mean no one doing what tool is doing in the music industry today. and what are they doing? hell, i have no clue. all i know is that this is about as good as its going to get until you see them live in concert. the album was recorded with hdcd which makes it very, very sweet to listen too. if you'll allow me to speak for you, than i would have to say that you will want to buy this album without hesitation. this is musical heaven, and i cant wait to hear it on vinyl.
__label__1 Not very good as a wall phone: I purchased this phone to replace a kitchen wall phone that had given me years of excellent service, unfortunately, even though this phone is listed for wall phone use, in order to get the receiver to remain in place when you try to hang it up it takes several tries to delicately balance the receiver on the hang up hook before it stays on the phone. Very, Very, annoying. I am now looking for a replacement phone. Oh, for the good old days of quality made products
__label__1 Don't waste your money!: I bought two of these and neither of them work. Unfortunately I did not save the packaging so into the trash they go.I tried the bubble solution that came in the package as well as other brands, and the bubble machine fails to produce bubbles consistently. You are better off with a single wand and blow your own.Save your money. Don't buy this product.
__label__2 OK Strings: These ara OK, ...the only negative is that they are just long enough, ..dont leave room for error ...but so far so good, nice strings for the price.
__label__2 Most Comprehensive Review on The Best Trees in Arlington!: This is probably the definitive text on trees in Arlington. Erudite and amusing, Rose-Wood weaves a tale of these fine, woody plants that kept me turning page after page. My first edition golden yarn bound copy is also printed on acid-free paper to combat smudging from my thin minted hands.
__label__2 Can't get enough: Any fan of NASA and the Apollo program must have this set. I have watched it more than a dozen times and will probably watch it a dozen more. It is the perfect compliment to other Apollo documentaries. Tom Hanks has done everything right in this one. If you can find a friend who loves the space program and they don't already own this set, you must get it for them, they will absolutely love it. I only wish they would make another series about more of the origins of our space program.
__label__1 Avoid this one, it contains serious errors and omissions: Unfortunately this work contains numerous errors. A few examples:--The Indian tribe described for the mission was a minority group there--the tribe that made up the majority is not even mentioned;--The local Indians did not hunt buffalo from horses, as depicted in a drawing; and--The local Indians did not make clay bowls, as a caption indicates.These are serious, fundamental omissions and errors. Accordingly, I cannot recommend this book.
__label__1 Not compatible: This product was not compatible with my Nextar P3 GPS. I would want amazon to do a better job describing the products. The only reason I purchased this item was that the description said it is compatible with Nextar GPS.Too bad I was fooled by you guys.
__label__2 Julian & Desari BK 5: The Deeeper I get into this series the More I like it. Love the hero & Heroine of this Book...Christine Feehan is an Awesome Writer!! love her books in this Series. The Storylines are Great keeps you interested thru out the whole book!!
__label__1 NOT TIFFEN!!!: Beware these are not Tiffen branded lens shades but ordinary Adorama brand lens shades. Adorama please update this listing.
__label__1 have i been in hibernation?: 'WHERE ARE THE YOUNGER YOUNGER 28'S AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THEM' were my first thoughts when i heard this album. i remember the younger younger 28's from such cd's as the soundtrack to 'test drive 4' where they accompanied orbital in making one of the best game soundtracks there ever was, in my opinion. when i heard they were finally releasing an album, i had an order in even before it was to be released, a month before infact. but to my disgrace, they sound like a bunch of pansies who have started to sing in their tracks. please tell me that this isn't infact the group i thought it was, but either way, i have just wasted good money on a cd that isn't worth listening to.
__label__1 Expensive toy that last for 2 weeks: I bought this toy for my 2 year old boy. The toy was hilarious. But, after 2 days my boy started to get bored of it. However, after 2 weeks of usage, the Elmo start to miss a few moves. After 1 month, it only laugh and waving his arm, without bending and rolling on the floor. This toy was quite expensive, so i expect a stronger durability. Should have spend the money on some other toy.
__label__1 Piece of junk: Even with the soap trick, which will work for a few minutes, the jellyfish get trapped in the corner. What a piece of junk!
__label__1 I've read it all before: I've been a bibliophile since I was about six years old, and this is the first and only book that I have ever thrown onto the floor in disgust. From the poor orphaned farm boy who gets swept up into an exciting adventure, to the completely predictable dragons, dwarves and elves, to the Star Wars-esque evil empire and resitance movement, to the appearance of the white bearded wizardly mentor (tm), it seems as if every single stale fantasy cliche gets trotted out and pressed into service. This is a book composed of stock characters and overused plot points in an entirely typical and unimaginative pseudo-medieval fantasy setting. Anyone looking for a good YA fantasy novel would probably be better off with something by Diana Wynne Jones, Garth Nix, Tamora Pierce, Phillip Pullman, J.K. Rowling, Holly Black, Monica Furlong, Susan Cooper, or any of the many other writers out there who have come up with vastly better books for younger fantasy fans.
__label__2 Decent: A good little clock for a decent price. The green read-out is easy on the eyes, and the buzzer never fails to awake me. Just make sure the battery is fresh, or the alarm will not function when the power is out.
__label__2 Pure Magic: This is the Count at his best. Sammy Nestico the doyen of arrangers is simply superb. As a trumpet player I have had these lead parts for many years. At last I can listen and learn.
__label__1 Cable unlimited: This cable does not give the nature color. It looked worse than my VGA cable. Sorry, I have to tell the truth.
__label__1 Do not buy this flashlight!!!: This is a terrible flashlight. I purchased this flashlight quite some time ago to replace a rechargeable flashlight that we had forever that finally wore out. We plugged it and assumed it would work but didn't check it until several months later. It does not hold a charge at all. Unfortunately, we did not keep the return slip or packaging from Amazon. I have never written a review before but I thought it was worth my while to warn everyone not to purchase this item.
__label__1 Not a good book for beginning programmers!: I am so sorry that I chose this book for my CS 1 course! I wish I could start the semester over. At first glance this looked like a reasonable book but by Chapter 3 I knew we were in trouble. Bishop introduces material too quickly, too compactly, and too abstractly. Her examples are huge and cumbersome. My kids are really confused and probably annoyed -- Here's another stupid college textbook that makes us feel like nincompoops! The title is *QUITE* misleading; this is *NOT* a gentle introduction to Java or programming principles. By the way, there's a cultural barrier, too, that North American students will find hard to hurdle. Just check out the "1 man went to mow" song on p. 68 to find out what I mean.
__label__2 Laymon: Pretty typical Laymon, and like Laymons other stuff, its Good! Its quick paced, bloody amd loads of fun. I found this book real suspenseful.
__label__1 bad dvd!, but movie was good to a point: I got the movie on time with no problems, but I was only allowed to watch about an hour of it before it freeze framed. I removed the dvd and found some defects on the disk. tried cleaning the disk and got the same thing. I even tried another dvd player and even cleaned my dvd players and got the same results. I would have sent the dvd back, but the cost and time to mail it is that worth the effort. So I downloaded the digital copy which wasted another 20 minutes of my time and was not happy with the mp4 compression on the video as it was not the best quality. Also your stuck using apple's itunes or quicktime to watch. I can't blame the seller for this problem, but lionsgate needs to improve it's quality control! Amazon is going to send me a replacement copy, and shipping label to return the defective dvd disk, how great is that!
__label__2 One of the best bands of all time: Led Zeppelin is one of the best bands of all time. This CD is one of their best. When I think of Led Zeppelin I think of their great guitar work on their songs. This CD is no exception. Every song on this CD had great guitar licks. "In The Evening" is one of my favorite songs on this CD. The song starts out like you are going through a maze and all of a sudden the guitar work kicks butt. "South Bound Saurez" is another song that the guitar licks kick butt. "Hot Dog" sounds like a country song with mostly music but still a good song. "Carouselambra" is a great song that really moves you when you listen to it. "All Of My Love" the biggest song on this CD is a classic and a slow song that you can dance to. Another slow song is "I'm Gonna Crawl." Only 7 songs on this CD but it is a great buy. If you love Led Zeppelin then you need this in your CD collection.
__label__2 This is one of the best !: Out of all the various US made/produced DVDs, this DVD has the best video transfer. Besides the video/audio quality, the animation is great. The story resembles that of Lupin the 3rd. The anime has good story lines, great characters, humor, action, mecha...but most of all, this show has style...which is further reinforced by the jazz/blues soundtrack. If you are not into giant robots and pokemon, this is the one for you. It's very, very enjoyable.
__label__1 If I could give this a zero, I would: I bought this antenna today, because I was trying to improve the FM reception for certain of my favorite stations, without resorting to listening to them online, or spending lots of money getting HD radio. Well, this isn't even worth the plastic it's made of. I've never written a review on Amazon, but I don't want anyone to waste their money buying this. After fiddling with the antenna for a few hours, I decided to cannibalize another FM antenna wire (the cheap ones that come with a receiver), joining them together to make the one I'm using twice as long. Cost? $0.10 if I'm being generous. Result? Perfect. No static, no problems. Why buy this worthless thing? This antenna is going back to the store.
__label__1 The worst book I've read in a very long time.: I've long been interested in the Amish culture and way of life. I chose to read this book to add an additional perspective on what I've already read about the Amish. I am disappointed that the book feels like a self-serving pitch for the author and her husband to make a profit off a sordid story. I don't feel as though I've gained new insight into why some leave the Amish community, how they come to make that decision and its implications. I couldn't finish the book--I couldn't stomach it any longer and am irritated with myself for contributing money toward someone I feel had their heart in the wrong place in publishing the book. There are plenty of other worthwhile, thoughtful and insightful stories to read. This is the only book I've ever bought from Amazon that I feel strongly enough about to write a review. My advice is to skip this one.
__label__2 Very good for the uninitiated: In the spirit of full disclosure I do know the film maker, having been fortunate enough to have worked with him in the past.That being said, I really enjoyed this doc. I really didn't know anything about the subject matter prior to watching but came away with a good understanding of what it's all about.This wasn't a doc that was strictly "preaching to the choir". My own spiritual beliefs, or lack thereof, are very different from what is conveyed in the program, but I found it very watchable and didn't feel that it was too preachy.The production values and tech aspects were right on. This was very well done.
__label__1 It's Rotted to the Core: Like a rotten apple this "garbage" is the only way to describe this mess of a cd. Mandonna looks awful and sounds awful. May she go away forever!
__label__2 BEWARE: VERY HARD GAME: Ok, I'm sure if you read any reviews before this one you got the picture, but just in case: This is a gorgeous game. I mean the kind of game that makes you feel like you're really there. But then you get over that and realize you've got a game to play. So anyway, the story's confusing, and sort of stupid, but the game's really pretty fun. You could spend hours jumping and swimming, as long as you don't get seasick. The biggest problem is that this game is hard. Unfairly hard. Evilly hard. Or maybe it's just me. But I don't think it is. I gave up on the first level and looked at a walkthrough I found on the internet. I still couldn't do it. I recommend this game anyway, especially if you're a skilled gamer. If you have no patience, try something else.
__label__2 does it all: As a long time film person, I really wanted to find a digital slr that could surpase the feel and quality of film without the guess. other digital cameras were basically point and shoot versions. with two children in athletics year round, the d50 does it all. we've shot over 3000 pictures in the past three months just of soccer and softball. the nikon software makes converting and storing a breeze. the only thing missing was a protector for the viewfinder, it's standard on the d70 and now the d80. there is an aftermarket available that does fine in that dept. I have recommended the d70 to so many people that nikon must put me on their marketing team.
__label__1 Does not work yet with MS-office 2007: I spoke to Neat Receipts. They confirmed that the business card scanner does not work as yet with MS-Office 2007, the primary purpose for which I bought the product. They requested me to hold on to Neat Reciepts until July, by when they promised the problem will be fixed. I am waiting!
__label__1 Keep Shopping: If you are interested only with picken' a few tunes this book may be what you are looking for. But, if you are interested in learning about the banjo and what makes it tick consider another title.
__label__1 Two great tracks: two stars: This album would have made a classic two-sided single, with his absolutely sick and brilliant version of "The 'In' Crowd" (dig those power chords and freakout guitar solo) backed with the original "Another Time, Another Place," which sounds like an outtake from "Stranded" or "Country Life." The rest of the album is at best OK--depends on how much you like the songs he's covering. It's pretty much a must-buy album for those two songs alone...try to find a used copy.
__label__2 Party Hard....it's about time!: OK, we went through the guilt and sorrow that was grunge, sat through the pompus britpop wave, even got snotty with indie rock. NOW, it's time to PARTY HARD. This album is making it okay to have fun again. It's not deep by any means. Andrew WK is just opening a door for all of us to come on into his party.
__label__1 Some good, some bad: There are a few good recipes in this book, a lot of them using a dehydrator, her personal story is interesting but most people in the before-after photos haven't lost a lot of weight, if they've lost a pound at all.
__label__2 Non-Toxic: During the fall, the squirrels dig up all the plants in my small backyard, and sit on my fence and throw black walnut shells against the white paint on my garage, staining it deeply. I ignored this product for a long time assuming it was toxic and because I did not want to get rid of the squirrels completely. Once I realized it really was a safe mix that wouldn't kill everything, I thought it would be nice to try. And it is. I can put a very small amount on boxed plants and on my fence without scaring the squirrels out of the yard completely; the power of the black walnut tree overcomes all.
__label__2 Great movie: The movie was great. They made a film that can entertain. This was enjoyable, can't wait to pre-order it.
__label__2 Superb: Excellent reading! Accurate historical info! Excellent blend of love and tragedy. I laughed aloud. I felt the passion.
__label__2 Death can be funny...: Death can be funny and inteligent and... can put you to think about your own life. And that's great. So, you have here a wonderful show, not funny all the time but extremely well done, with an extraordinary plot.Shame it was only 2 seasons, but, on second thought, that is good because they haven't had the time to ruin it.If you want well written televisison, this is for you.
__label__1 Rent it, don't buy it: Yep, I bought it and regret it. Just not a very good movie at all. Visually, it's stunning in parts but for the most case, I can't see why this movie was made.
__label__1 Nipple covers: I was looking for something to offer more modesty when wearing a swimsuit and thought these would help. They are OK but not quite what I was looking for because the folds in the edges show through the fabric.
__label__1 Wretched: Absolutely positively the worst book I have ever read. It took me well over three months to get through this because I had to keep putting it down after reading a few pages at a time. I get that the main character is unbalanced, but his story was just so bizarre - much ado about nothing. I certainly do not understand why this is a classic. Just horrid.
__label__2 Awesome cd!: This is a great collection of Hilary's best songs! All of the hilary haters out there don't even waste your valuable time bashing her. She rocks and that's all there is to it. Here are my ratings 5 stars being the best and 1 star being the worst.....1. Wake Up- 5 stars2. Getaway- 4 stars3. Beat of heart- 3 stars4. Come Clean- 4 stars5. Who's That Girl- 4 stars6. Mr. James Dean- 3 stars7. So Yesterday- 5 stars8. Metamorphosis- 4 stars9. Rock This World- 3 stars10. Break my Heart- 4 stars11. Jericho- 3 stars12. Fly- 4 stars13. Supergirl- 3 stars14. Party Up- 3 stars15. Girl Can Rock- 3 stars16. Our Lips Are Sealed- 4 stars17. Why Not- 3 starsOverall this cd was well worth the extra money it was to buy the Collector's Edition. So if you're a Hilary Duff fan please go out and buy this great cd, you'll really like it!
__label__1 disappointing: This dollhouse is not worth the cost. While it has some positive aspects, it is not durable or well made. After 4 months of use we will be throwing it away and looking for another doll house from a different company.First the positives: it is colorful, big enough for barbies, and my daughter enjoyed playing with it while it lasted.The drawbacks: The wood and floors don't fit together well so that the floors keep falling out. There is really nothing to secure the floors in place besides a slot for them to sit in. Because it is poorly made, the floor doesn't snap into place and falls out whenever any weight is added. Next, the swing doesn't work. Anytime a doll is put in it, it flips over. Not so fun for a 5 year old.The concept is good, but the quality is poor.
__label__1 It is awsome wow wow wow oops it broke: this gun sucks i got this piece of crap a while ago and the barrel fell out a butt load of parts came out the stock brokethe reason all the other reviews are like 5 tars cause it is the dude selling it if u buy it youll be sorryIT IS JUST A PIECE OF CRAP GO 2 WALMART AND GET A SHOT GUN OR A PISTOL
__label__1 Kindle pricing: I'm always stunned that the pricing for a Kindle copy is more than a new paperback copy of any title in Amazon. No production cost, warehouse overhead or labor. How can this be justified?
__label__1 TYPOS, TYPOS, TYPOS!: I'm OK with paying for eBooks. I bought this one, but was so distracted by multiple scan-induced typographical artifacts that I requested (and received) a refund about two-thirds of the way through the book. Free eBooks force me to tolerate some typos, as those books are done by volunteers and not for profit. But, an $8 Kindle Book sold by Amazon should be free of such nuisances. This one wasn't, and I'm basing this review solely on the poor quality of the eBook itself, not the content or theme of this book. It's a shame to hype the Kindle format while simultaneously selling a sub-standard version of that very format!
__label__2 Excellent toy, excellent service.: Even when my son accidentally snapped the antenna it was immediately fixed with a single email and some very friendly customer service. They even covered it which I did not expect since it was very much the fault of the user. I also own the SC-750 and can't say enough good about the sets. These are used with a five year old with the more simple experiments and he is already starting to understand the concepts behind them.
__label__2 Best computer deal: I've been using this laptop for over a month already and the only thing I can say is that it is a great computer with all you can need for an intermediate demmanding user ( not advanced for the lack of a great graphic support ),but other than that is amazing for a daily personal or office work. Weight and size are not an issue for me for the intended use for the unit ( office not mobile ), nonetheless it's portable enough with great power and capability. Batter is in the medium range of performance.
__label__1 Narrow scope: I used to subscribe to Colonial Homes magazine and enjoyed it, but this book focuses primarily on upscale interpretations of colonial interior decoration. There is little representation of antique cookware, fireplaces, windows, etc. Perhaps the word "decorating" should have tipped me off, but I mostly see a bunch of pretty photos without a wide range of colonial styles. Where are the simpler, more rustic interiors? Most are closer to the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg than to any working person's home in colonial times.This book is more a representation of the Colonial Revival period, which came about a hundred years later than true colonial days, and which was itself a romanticized and updated version based on the original period.
__label__2 Great CD!: Great soundtrack. Love the voices and songs. Have always been a fan of Willie, Chris, and Cash.Difficult to find this CD in stores. Great price and quick delivery.
__label__1 I'm dissapointed: bought this Thermal Press Pot to replace one, of another brand, that had bit the dust after many years of faithful service. The old pot would easily keep my coffee hot for an hour, with this one after ten minutes the coffee is warm at best. The pot is thermal, but the lid is not. Also you have to be extemely careful not to dribble while pouring.
__label__2 Family favorite: This cd is one of my favorites for Christmas, I love the arrangements and these boys can really sing!!! O Holy Night is my avorite track on this CD
__label__1 Defective book: The pages of this travel guide book were not cut along the bottom to allow opening the pages without tearing. Very disappointed in the quality of this book.
__label__1 Worked for a bit...: I've had this DVD player since Xmas 2005, and recently it hasn't been working right. It will randomly open in the middle of playing a DVD, and if your DVD has a minor scratch on it, forget it. Really frustrating. But, my friend does have the same exact one and she's had it longer with no problems, so I guess it's just luck of the draw.
__label__1 Only good for a few months: I've gone through 2 of these twinhead replacement heads in the last couple months. Something happens when you frequently pump presta tubes. All of the sudden the twinhead fails and air goes out the Shrader side. Growing very tired of having a ride delayed or eliminated because the twinhead behaves so badly!
__label__1 Good idea in theory but didn't work: I bought this with high hopes but it didn't stick to the table well and anytime my daughter slightly tugged @ it, it came off. Returning it.
__label__1 What did people like so much???: I can't believe this book got such glowing reviews. It started off slow, got a little better in the middle, but then completely fizzled out at the end. The sex scenes were not relevant to the plot and just added to the unnecessary babble needed to fill the pages. I wanted so much to like this book, but just can't!
__label__2 Wedding Goddess is divine: Wedding Goddess is a soulful look at the sacred ritual of marriage. Laurie Sue Brockway brings you into the world of weddings in the most beautiful, altruistic sense rather than how the machine of the wedding industry commercializes it. Laurie Sue is a minister who customizes weddings to the individual--there's no pat formula here, just two people in love coming together in the way that makes them feel most connected. This book is for those who are getting married but also for everyone who wants to open your heart and honor the committment to yourself and humanity.
__label__1 Bent gate: The baby gate arrived quickly and was well packaged; however, after putting the gate up, I realized that it was slightly bent and doesn't align well with the door frame, making it more difficult to open and close. The pedal does still work. I got this gate for my dogs in order to keep them separate from the cat. Unfortunately, if they jump on the gate hard enough they can push it down. I think I would have been better off getting a gate that needed to be screwed into the wall. The hands free opener is a nice touch and the dogs haven't been able to figure it out.
__label__2 I love kelly!!!: I thought that this CD is a worthwile investment for it has all the great song of your singers packed into one CD. Definanetley a good CD to buy
__label__2 Good viewing: This magnification credit card is an excellent product. It magnifies even the smallest type, such as that on product labels one might encounter in stores. It fits in your wallet. All this at a remarkably low price.
__label__1 What?: Sarah's Seduction (Men of August, Book 2)Ok, I love Lora Leigh's books but I just finished reading this one and I have to say...What? The story is about an abused girl brought to live with three abused brothers. Let me see...They are her addoptive uncles, everyone has been sexually abused and now they all want to be a family and have sex together. I fliped back several times to see if I missed something since you never really know how everyone is related or how they were abused or why they are together. I'm sorry to say I would skip this one.
__label__1 Beware of the Purpose Driven Church! It is not what it seems: On the surface, PDC looks innocent enough. But once the curriculum is implemented in the church, there are changes you didn't bargain for. The Holy Spirit is subdued, the church is run like a corporate business. (remember, God's ways are not our ways) The sermons are boring and similar to New Age thinking (everything is based on "how I feel"). People who don't like the changes (the spiritually-mature and Biblically-established Christians) are told to go with the program or get out! The church may grow, but the new converts are being taught only a 'positive' message. Sin, redemption, repentance are not mentioned. The whole Gospel is not preached. Please!DO NOT USE THE PURPOSE-DRIVEN CHURCH CURRICULUM IN YOUR CHURCH!
__label__1 Not A Good Movie: This film, about an address book killer that gets in a car wreck and whose soul goes online during a freak storm while getting a cat scan, is horrible and predictable. The movie is sterile looking with a bad look and feel. It was suspensless and extremely un-entertaining. Skip this.
__label__1 10 days and waiting for shipping arrival from BargainCell: 12.96 for shipping to San Diego seemed high but expected quick shipment. I am concerned after reading how others received quick service. No shipment tracking data yet received except an estimate of 14-17 Jan arrival, which has now passed. I will contact Amazon if no status received in next two days and order from Ebay.Go San Diego Chargers!
__label__1 Very Disappointing: Although, I love the author Stephanie Laurens this has to be one of the most boring books she has ever written. Stephanie Laurens is a great author but the problem is that she is too repetitious with her novels. She uses the same plot over and over again: the heroine is reluctant to marry the man she loves because she does not want to lose her independence! She used this plot in the Bar Cynsters and even that theme got tired! I seriously recommend that you not buy this book because you will be disappointed! I was.
__label__1 Galaxy Cheesey???: When this film came out I was too young to watch it theatrically I was 9 but I do remember it fondly from the old "Telepromters Galaxy" service of the then new Showtime..It played constantly..I was hooked at age of 11 in 1982..I bought this film now available for the first time on blu-ray just as I remembered right down to the infamous "worm rape" scene this movie is way to short barely 80 minutes and long due for a remake (hint hint) Erin Moran was a lousy choice for a empath in this movie I think and the only thing that shines in this movie was all the hard work that the effects team led by James Cameron did and Cameron's second unit photography..this blu-ray plays more like a dvd there is no closed caption and minimal featurettes..great popcorn movie though..
__label__2 NYHC till I die!!!!!!!: I saw this band live in 007 club in Prague. It was probably on of the best performances I have ever seen.I didn't know them before, but the second they touched their strings I knew I'm in the rigt place. All people there, straight edge kids, vegans, punks, NYers were so stoked, they wanted more even if the band played all of their songs, half the Integrity songs, and also one from Iron Maiden . People just shouted" I want more of thist shovelhead HC". And that's exactly how this band sounds. Mixed between Kassel Crew german Ryker's type and Madball, it's metal as it gets. It just makes you want to go out and kick in our unfair world!!!
__label__2 Panic Mouse Entertains: although, in my opinion, not as fun looking as the original panic mouse, which looked like a giant yellowmouse, this new design is technically superior. it's quieter than the orignal and it has a timer which doeswonders for conserving battery life. my cat gives it four paws!
__label__2 IVORY EXTENSION LINE: Very nice cord. Works very well and connectors are on solidly. The color make it almost invisable around a white base board. I take my phone everywhere now!!!
__label__1 Some Songs Are OK: The fans who say this is TM's best album are going way too easy on him. I think they're so devoted to him that they'd buy a CD of him singing the phonebook. About half the songs are OK, the other half are second-rate. I like "My Old Friend," "Blank Sheet of Paper," "Just Be Your Tear," "Kill Myself," and "Carry On."
__label__2 JAZZ like never before...: I'm young so I'm not much of a jazz fan but I was with my mother the other day as she played the new Bobby Lyle "Joyful". It sounded more like instrumental R&B than jazz. He has one track "Caught Up" that I just had to hit repeat for. This track features Howard Hewitt and Jarrard Anthony on vocals. Take it from someone who hated jazz all her life, Bobby Lyle's "Joyful" is a must buy CD to add to your music collection!
__label__2 The ultimate Backstreet collection for proud and closet fans: This collection is all of their top 10 hits. Not only am I a huge fan, but I own every cd they've ever made. Even guys I know, that don't like Backstreet all that much have this cd. It's the ultimate love song collection as well as the ultimate Backstreet Boys collection.
__label__1 Blu Ray Version doesn't work: The one star is specifically for the Blu Ray version of the Office Season 6 because the set was released with a serious flaw. The first disc freezes up on the "Niagra" episode, and no amount of firmware updating helps the problem. A quick search of the internet shows that this problem is widespread. Universal just goofed and didn't test the set enough before releasing it. Hopefully, a fix will come out soon. In the meantime, props to Amazon for being very gracious about the return.
__label__1 Release Extended Editions: We have already bought both extended and theatrical releases on dvd. Now they are trying to make us do it on blu-ray. This is ridiculous.
__label__2 Love the kindle: I absolutely love my kindle! To have any book I want, at anytime is wonderful. I always have something to read.
__label__1 not worth the price: I would actually give it a zero .. and would REALLY REALLY like a refund. The wavy lines at the top and bottom make it look like a 16mm film from 30+ years ago that was burned onto a DVD. It was VERY short and VERY poor quality. Two WONDERFUL DVDs I did order around the same time were VISIONS of ENGLAND and VISIONS of ITALY. These were cheaper, longer and EXCELLENT quality DVDs. (Unfortunately, Amazon does not give a refund on DVDs if opened .. but I did not know the awful quality .. until I opened it a played it. Can these rules be changed?)
__label__2 Vent Shade: Good product, great value for money, rapid shipment, highly recommended...easily obtained .. most competitive price available being compared with other sources...thanks you for this service
__label__1 Boring, boring and more boring: I found the story very weak and not even interesting. The set and fling was really poor. Nothing convicted me abut this movie, which considering the price was really disappointing. I thought that e movie would be something really enjoyable but sorry folks it is just junk.
__label__2 Thanks to my elementary school teacher...: If I could recall one event from my entire elementary school career that left an indelible impression it would be my second grade teacher reading James and the Giant Peach to our class. I absolutely loved this book, because it was so imaginative and created such wonderful imagery in my mind. I am forever grateful to my teacher for introducing Roald Dahl's collection of books to me!
__label__2 Nirvana's best!: In my opinion, this is the best Nirvana song. If you like it, you should buy it. But it's almost the same price to buy Nevermind, so you might want to grab that too. To sum it up, this is a great CD, so buy it if you like any other of Nirvana's work.
__label__1 Just horrid: I bought this at the same time as I purchased my Zen Plus. I actually bought two of each, one for the wife and one for myself. No matter which station I select, the signal is bad. I placed it outside, next to the antenna, no deal, static was louder than the music. I have two vehicles I tried both tramsmitters on, a Nissan Versa and a Chevy Venture. Ended up buying wife a new stereo for the van with aux front input and bluetooth for the phone from Crutchfield.com.
__label__2 Good dvd for youngster: We really loved this DVD.My 4 year old grandson, me and my husband, all of us enjoyed.Especially we've been reading this book to him so many times, more interesting than just reading the book.It became the one of his favorite DVD.
__label__1 Missing Song: How this CD is so called "The Best Of Jimmy James" when is missing his best song ever "Come to me Softly" this song was recorded in 1967 on The ATCO seal
__label__1 I learned my lesson . . .: The wonders that remixing a song to 30 seconds and laying images of models in a sportscar over it can bring. This album is simply trashy, distracted, and soulless. The comparison to Fatboy is totally apt, as neither one can crank out a song without the utmost concentration, preferring instead to loop grating samples and inane lyrics around beats with the attention span of a fly. Why did I think that there would be some funk and some juice here? Oh yeah, those models in the sportscar . . .
__label__2 Part of Yes' comeback: There are two good tracks on this. BTW this is the same as disc 2 on Keys to Ascention Part 2. MindDrive is an 18 minute epic with heavy Wakeman inputs. Sign Language is a simplified piece of Anderson's Harp counterpointed by Howe's guitars. One of yes' most unusual pieces.This album is better than most of Yes' - particularly the bleak 80s production. Magnification is better overall album. I would rank this about #7 or so of Yes' 30 albums.
__label__1 I THINK KANYE IS JUST A PHASE AND WILL PHASE OUT SOON: KANYE WEST MAKES SO MUCH MONEY WITH HIS ALBUMS WHY DOESNT HE DONATE HIS OWN MONEY FOR HURRICANE RELIEF AND STARVATION INSTEAD HE SPENDS IT ON JEWELRY WHEN THERES KIDS STARVING AROUND THE WORLD. ROC A FELLA SUCKS AND NAS SHOULDVE NEVER GAVE HIM THE PLEASURE OF BEING IN HIS ALBUM. KANYE IS A NAS WANNA BE.
__label__1 Big disappointment for highly touted book ...: This book would only be useful if I were travelling to Spain. And even the 3 days I spent there, not a single word was mentioned of Bilbao, Valladolid, and the northern Atlantic cities. Very dissappointing. The book reserves all of about 30 pages on Portugal, none of which provide nearly as insightful as the Lonely Planet or Michelin guides. My advice, save your money and buy something else.
__label__1 Enough Tributes: I'm sorry, but I'm getting tired of these guest star/tribute albums. I'm finding most to be disappointing, including this one.Yes, the lineup on these two discs is outstanding, and I'm a big Ralph Stanley fan. The musicianship on the discs is, not surprisingly, first rate. Same for the recording and song selection. And Ralph is in fine form. But IMHO the sum does not equal the parts. There's no flow to the recording, and most importantly, there is a lack of intensity and feeling that is definitely present on so many of Stanley's other discs, solo and with the Clinch Mountain Boys. Iif you want to know what makes Stanley special, stick to his original stuff.
__label__2 Great Album: This album proves just what the visionaries of Electronic music set in motion, a Tale of Change that has truly changed the face of music as I see it. A lot of bands turned to Kraftwerk. This album is total ear candy with a good mix of melodies (not in the form of vocals, but in the form of synthesizers), beat and inginuity as well as creativity. To me, this is by far one of their best albums. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 The Notebook: I loved the book. It was a little different from the movie which I'd already seen but still a great book!!
__label__2 THE BIRTH OF PINK FLOYD!!: Although drastically different from Floyd's later works, this album is still pretty incredible. An asset for any Pink Floyd fan, and for fans of Syd Barrett.
__label__2 A good place to start - answers lots of questions: This is a great book to get to see if trim work is something you feel you can tackle on your own. It explained many things, though I felt it could use some more diagrams to follow along with the well written 'how-to' instructions. The supply vendor list could use an update with email and/or web site addresses.
__label__2 Great walk down memory lane: I bought this movie set for my 3yr old son, who is absolutely Sesame Street obsessed. However I think my husband and I enjoyed it as much as he did. Especially the original seasons when the show first came on the air. A great look back over four decades of "Sunny Days".
__label__2 jackson browne [ revisited ]: running on empty is every thing BUT running on empty , Browne a real crowd pleaser ; love the piano , he successfully mixes rock and country { i can here the purists crying ] but thats what he has done as well as melded other sounds not common to others.
__label__2 Treasure Hunting and Treasure Finding: I am a collector of sports memorabilia and treasures. Mitchell and Ness Sporting Goods is famous for their reproduction retro sports jerseys. They also sell genuine articles and artifacts. While I leave the fake reproductions to the hip hop crowd, I'll pay big bucks for the real thing. I saw a first edition copy of '64 Intruder buried under some items in a display window. I purchased it(at retail) only because of its status as a first edition and possible future value as a future collectable, not its literary merit. I didn't even bother reading it until a boring Sunday about Six-months later. Well that boring Sunday didn't turn out too boring. What an intriguinging and captivation story Gregory T. Glading had spun. I literally couldn't put it down and turned all of its 200 or so pages in one sitting! This is great book and I hope others are as lucky as me to find a copy. I only hope someone makes a movie of it during my lifetime.
__label__1 Keeps it hot but too big for cupholder: Leak-proof, definitely, but you still have to be careful. When you screw in the lid, some coffee may remain around the rim, and this can leak out when the mug is overturned. I usually turn the mug upside down and shake it to get rid of the extra drops.There is also no visual indication that the top is sealed. So you can plop the coffee mug onto the seat, and coffee leaks out because you can't tell whether the mug is sealed all of the way. User error? Carelessness? Perhaps a little, but the design needs to be reworked a bit. I recommend the Nissan 14-oz stainless steel vacuum travel tumbler at [...]The mug is too wide to fit in the cupholders of my 1996 Subaru Outback. I usually prop up the mug next to a bag or books but invariably the mug tips over and the coffee spills out for one of the above reasons.If it weren't for these reasons, I'd love the mug. It keeps the coffee hot, and it's nice to have a handle to grab hold of.
__label__2 pretty nice: Machine actually does pulverize leaves...slowly. Wet leaves, dry leaves; passes small twigs through without damage and the cutting lines are easy to change. Much better than any leaf vacuum I've used. Much better than using a string trimmer that then burns out due to the dust. It is, however, bulky to store and very light duty. After three bags of leaves it gets hot so I give it a rest. Glad I got it. Hope it will last a while.
__label__1 ABSOLUTELY UNFUNNY: I hate giving this only 1 star, as I am a huge fan of Tracy Ullman, but this movie stunk. & since I'm the sort of person who laughs at everything, that's pretty bad. Concussions causing sex addiction? Please. The script was terrible, the acting turgid, & I stopped watching 1/2 thru the bloody thing.Waste of time. Don't bother.
__label__2 A fine book about the real Vietnam and the reality of US Vietnamese: This is a powerful and very well written book. I know Vietnam rather well (not as a tourist) and this is a rare book that gives the reader an understanding of the traumatic postwar period in this sad and beautiful country. But the book is also a chronicle of a Vietnamese refugee family and its tragic American Odyssey, and finally it is a travelogue and a book for cyclists (like me) to admire. But above all the combination of honesty and fine prose makes this a special book and so much more fulfilling than the endless sentimental and US -centric Vietnam War books that obscure the truth about this extraordinary country.
__label__1 Bad stitching: Didn't know that "Replica" meant handmade, but either way it was poor quality. From far away it looks correct, but at a reasonable distance you see that the stitches are frayed and it is poor quality :( Very disappointed.
__label__1 Unhappy that I spent so much on this waffle iron: The first few batches were a mess despite following the instructions for first time use. After that, the waffles never, EVER baked evenly. They were always too light and soggy around the edges. And the recommended 1 cup of batter was way too much. What a mess! My biggest complaint, however, is that the handle broke after only about two dozen uses. It was quite a challenge tracking down the phone number for the company because the number printed in the instruction manual was no longer valid - how convenient. I was told that the warranty was expired and I was out of luck. What a waste of money. VERY poorly made.
__label__2 The Baby Book: I first bought this book when my first child was born. Since then, I have bought it for baby showers and lent my copy to a friend (who eventually just kept it). Now that I am having a second child I just purchased another copy. I love the sections on bonding with your baby after birth and nursing. I wish that I had read both before the birth of my first child. There is also practical information and advice on child development, going back to work and nursing, childhood illness, and when to call your child's doctor. In short, I love this book.MeganMother of 1 and a half.
__label__2 Best cover for you litter maid box: This probably the best cover you can get for the littermaid box. Fits well and still provide enough privacy. My cat had adjusted to it within a few days.
__label__1 NOT TO GOOD!!!!!: Wish there was some way to get your money back when you did not like a book. The author has already made his by that time. I think Hearstone has to many characters and to many different stories going on at the same time. I was totally confused. The story is about who killed Richie Walters and Elaine Murray. Wasit the Collidge brothers, Bobby and Billy or not? Was the key witness told what to say? What about the prisoners who said they knew something. Of course the detective will do what ever to solve the case. The DA is looking out for him self and his future even if he holds back the truth. The last few pages of the trail were very good. The rest was not. I think the best thing I got was a line on page seven, "Getting into heaven was not going to depend on the size of his waistline." This is my second Margolin book may try another but doubtful.
__label__2 True Adventure: This is the cycling book that you are looking for. Scott is truly insane or truly courageous!
__label__2 Small and works well: Nothing worse than a small pump that takes forever to use when on a trail.The Mini DXG is the exception to the rule. I have had to use it twice and was pleasantly surprised how well it works with a 26inch mountain bike tire.I cannot comment on the use with a road bike that requires a high pressure of 110lbs or more.
__label__2 glow in the dark twinkle stars: I bought this for my daughter. We put them on the ceiling loves to look at them when she goes to bed.The colorful ones don't glow quite as well as other ones, but they work.
__label__1 will someone tell me: Here's a stupid question. What exactly is in this box. Is this the whole series, or just volume 1, what languag is it in? and how many discs are there? Nothing on this page seems to answer that.
__label__1 Installation nightmare: Tried installing on two computers with no luck. Went to Pinnacle website and downloaded driver, still no luck. Clobbered existing USB drivers.
__label__1 Review is right- it is like the Swiftboat book!: The Amazon review says :"But just as the swift boat veterans convinced millions of voters that John Kerry lacked the character to be president, Klein's book will influence everyone who is sizing up the character of Hillary Clinton."That is right. A book filled with lies hoping to change elections. This book is a disgrace to Penguin Publishing.
__label__1 Bernie: Bernie was awful, I expected to see a dead man acting funny but this wasn't the same Bernie , even though it was made to look like him.
__label__2 Great Classic: If you have seen the movies or know the story, the book is a completely different experiance! Beautiflly written and so much more than just a story about a man who doesn't age while the portrait does. Captivating and darkly thought provoking.. Great writting and facinating characters. Highly recommended!
__label__1 Norpro 14 inch x 12 inch stainless steel cookie sheet: I don't like the Norpro stainless steel cookie sheet. It's flimsy, cheap. I got what I paid for. I like stainless steel products but I'm learning that you really have to pay attention to the quality.
__label__1 Krav Maga = Nothing New: There is nothing new in this book that has not been taught before by other self defense systems or martial arts instructors and CQB instructors such as Col. Applegate (taught in 1943), Fairbairn, Sykes. This system is nothing more than an eclectic blend of martial arts with a Israeli label. This is not to say that some of the techniques are without merit. These techniques are designed to face an armed adversary, which in the middle east it is a high probability, not in the U.S.A. at least not yet. If you feel the odds are against you for facing an armed attacker, then carry a gun and learn some unarmed self defense techniques. Again, this book has some merits for soldiers and anti-terrorist troops. For the civilian interested in self-defense there are many more books published which have more to offer the reader. Pass on this book and check my listmania on self-defense boooks.
__label__2 I've loved all of them!: Every single Dear America book I've come I've loved, and this one is no different. Though perhaps a little slow-moving at times, I really recommend it, and all other books of it's serie.
__label__2 Words of Wisdom...: Susy Smith's AfterLife Codes is a wonderful book to read. She warms your heart sharing stories of her psychic adventures. Her words are from experience and many years of research. Words of wisdom to those that read them and allow their spirit to listen. We can all identify with Susy Smith, a feeling of knowing there is something beyond this life. Ms.Smith hopes to challenge our perceptions and give us proof. I enjoyed this book for its candid humor at times and also for the truth that Susy Smith hopes to convey and hopes that her readers will take her challenge seriously. She has spent her entire life devoted to truth, keeping an open mind and heart when it comes to possibilities of our souls eternal progression. Ms. Smith is very believeable and worth the read. Enjoy!
__label__2 Great Action: This is a great movie with really excellent photography. Johhny Dep is "perfect" in this role as is Christian Bale and others. Anyone that is a fan of police/crime dramas will really enjoy this one!
__label__1 Splitter puts lines on both screens: I plugged this splitter into my brand new Dell computer.After it was plugged into both screens, they both had lines that made viewing unacceptable. I am now going to try a splitter with a booster for more money. You get what you pay for.
__label__1 Quality could be better: For something with the Harley Davidson name on it, and how much it cost, I expected better quality.Not a bad tie, but worth no more than about $10.
__label__1 Do NOT get this for acne out of desperation: ..because that's what I did. I have been to so many dermatologists to no avail. This was gross and sticky. Honestly, if you have irritated, oily skin the last thing you need is to put honey on it. I was a gross, sticky, sweaty mess. I've determined that the honey makers got together because of the decline in population of bees and concocted that honey is a cure-all. Um, no---you just want my money.I intend on returning this. I didn't like how strong it tasted either and can't even look at the container now because it looks like it's got mustard inside it; gross.
__label__2 Old Pentagle fan gets rid of scratches: When I recently had an urge to listen to Pentangle, I discovered that two (yes two) of my old Pentangle albums had gone missing (and maybe had been for years).This selection appears to be pretty close to what I would have chosen myself (usually there's one favourite mssing). So if you're familar with the music it's nice to supplement those ancient albums with a CD and if you're not, this is pretty much all you need.
__label__2 Triple Tiger is very good.: If anything, get Driger G for the Triple Tiger attack ring. It has some of the best upper attack in the plastic generation, and is very, very usefull in attack-type combos.
__label__2 superb: This CD is a all time favorite! Tastefull,Energetic,Emotion,& etc. I can relax as I hear the first Two songs (I "feel"Happiness,Joyful,Truth,).Opening up too what is running through my mind. Getting intouch with myself. :p
__label__2 Great product: It works! It peels and slices apples for our fruit drying efficiently. Should have bought it long time ago.
__label__2 fantastic comedy-adventure: Brooke Shields is more beautiful than ever in BRENDA STARR, a cute comedy-adventure-mystery based on the buxom comic-strip character.As the journalist Brenda Starr, Shields has a ball. In each scene, she is priceless, and ravishing in Bob Mackie's cavalcade of wonderful costumes.Diana Scarwid also is wonderful, as Brenda's arch-rival Libby Lips. Also of note are June Gable, Jeffrey Tambor, Tony Peck and Charles Durning.Timothy Dalton, as Brenda's suave love-interest Basil St John, has charisma and charm to spare. The adventure builds as Brenda travels deep into the Amazon to retrieve a miracle formula that could save or destroy the world.BRENDA STARR was mauled by critics and audiences alike when first released. In fact the film was delayed and kept on the shelf for 7 years before being officially released. A decade later, BRENDA STARR has been re-discovered by new and old audiences alike as an enjoyable farce that doesn't need to be taken seriously.Delightful viewing.
__label__2 Excellent Machu Picchu guide: I have been to Machu Picchu a few times and this guide is right on. Machu Picchu is a can-not-miss experience and this guide makes it that much more enjoyable. Great pictures, insightful information.
__label__2 Better than I thought: I bought this music box for my 4 yr old daughter. She loves it !! It is perfect for her little hands to hold with out dropping. She loves that it lights up when she opens the lid. I am very happy with what I got for the price and I will more then likely buy more from the collection.
__label__2 Want to connect with the family?: This is a great game that I had fun with when I was young. I purposely looked for the original game and we sure have fun with it. Don't lose the checkers- good eye had coordination. Love it!!!
__label__2 The Best Album Of 1998: The Parc Boys have put out the best album this year and the best N.W. album since Mother Love Bone's Apple. It sound like a cross between the Pixies and Blur. The best song is "I got People" which is synth heavy and has the chorus of the decade!! These Seattle boys are going to be huge!!!!
__label__2 very good: This is the best way ever to cook fish. Then in a bottom layer cook broccoli and in a top layer spinach leaves. Turns out great.
__label__1 Master Lock = Too Easy Pick!: I've been using combination locks on my lockers since middle school. Yet, if you go to a giant college (large public school in general), like I do, I DO NOT recommend this lock! Recently, when I was in my body building class somebody tampered with my lock and got into my locker. The person stole my backpack, jeans, wallet, and keys, and did so WITHOUT breaking the lock, and even did me the favor of re-locking it before running off with my stuff! The only damage done to the lock was a few dents on the bottom and side and honestly, the combination wheel turns even smoother now that it's all beaten up. As well, there is no need to even beat the lock to open it. One can simply learn how to open a master lock combination lock with only a piece of a soda can, on the internet.
__label__1 Better info elsewhere: Pretty old books. First volume is just trig tables that your calculator will give you. Next two volumes have all the gear formulas, but not a lot of explanation on how to apply them.
__label__1 New version of lavilin sucks: I've been using lavilin for many years. But this new version is nowhere NEAR as effective as the old version in the black round box.My bet it the major deodorant companies have bought the Lavilin company, or have paid them off in some way to make this VASTLY INFERIOR product.z
__label__1 Sub-Tolkein-esque sequel generator: I've had this book lying around for a while now, and only brought myself to read it recently. Perhaps I've a little premonition in me somewhere, 'cos it turned out that I was right to be wary. From the start I found the principal characters irritating, and this was not helped by the sheer predictability of the storyline. Well-written it may be, but Tolkein-esque is almost too gentle a word for the plot.I won't go into all the "spot the Tolkein reference" passages, but if I were Gollum, I would be phoning my lawyers. There were several nice ideas scattered about through the book, but I found myself constantly put-off by the whinging of the principals, and their interminable agonising over their actions. All this, coupled with an ending that just seemed to materialise out of the need for a trilogy, means that I won't be following this one up, I'm afraid.
__label__1 The Worst Meistersinger: The Singers are not bad. But, Karajan shows us queer and dirtysounds. I can not understand! I can not find 'dynamics' anywhere. Andthis Orchestral sounds can not be Bayreuth's. If you want to feel original dramatic Bayreuth's sounds, choose 'Silvio Varviso''s one(My favorite. If you want to feel clean and neat sounds, choose 'Sir Georg Solti''s last one. END
__label__2 Pretty good, but not perfect...: First, be warned...only one of the four 20-minute Dora episodes on this DVD has anything to do with Halloween. The first segment is about Halloween and my two year old loves it! But the remainder of the episodes, including one about a wizard who is missing his wand, are just average. But I still give it four stars just because the Halloween episode is so good.
__label__2 FABULOUS: LOVE IT! I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S HIS BEST ALBUM YETFROM TRACK 1 ROCK -N- ROLL JESUS TO TRACK 12 (BONUS) LOWLIFE EVERY SONG IS FANTASTIC AND I CAN'T GET ENOUGH, NO I'M NOT A KID A 40 YEAR OLD ADULT FEMALE, SURPRISING HUH?HE TAKES HIS LIFE AND PUTS IT IN TO SONGS :)
__label__2 Well Done, Easy to Follow and Play Rock Sampler: First the quality: very good, with chord diagrams, notation and tabulature. It's a clear and easy way to learn the songs. Lyrics are easy to find, though small. It is an eclectic sampler of every decade of rock since the 50's including Fats Domino, Korn, Van Halen, the Eagles, Pantera, Don McLean and Sheryl Crow. Really good songs cover most rock styles...and that's where it shines.
__label__1 What a waste of money!: They had to be joking when they wrote this book. The first chapter pretends to prove plants have ESP because the needle jumps when plants are attached to lie detector machines. Then guesses are made as to what the moving needle means, such as "plants are sentient beings, plants have emotions, and plants can read minds." Give me a break! A lie detector measures electricity; electricity is produced as cells goes about the business of living. The authors top this off by informing us that the "scientist" performing these experiments offered his studies to the world for testing and replication -- in The International Journal of Parapsychology. Enough said!
__label__2 It's the greatest :): We have been researching Ice Cream machines for a while, and decided on this one. It was a GREAT decision. This machine does everything it says it does. Mostly we are vanilla ice cream people, but have tried other flavors also. Only suggestion I would make is putting a little less strawberries in the Strawberry Ice Cream because it seemed a bit dry.In 25 minutes we have the best vanilla ice cream money can buy. We get our cream at BJ's which is a huge savings over Grocery Stores. I use Jamaican Vanilla instead of the vanilla beans.
__label__2 My Favorite: Okay, I have lost count of the number of times I have read this book. Tamora Pierce is my favorite author. I have read all the Song of the Lioness, Immortals, and Circle of Magic books at least three times. I am dying to get my hands of the Protector of the Small and Circle Opens books. Even now, when I have read Alanna over and over again, I can't put it down. It is a timeless classic.
__label__2 Sands very well, dust collection worthless.: I picked one of these sanders up to replace an old Makita quarter sheet palm sander that keeps spitting the pad off. while sanding. I like the operation of the random orbit better as it leaves no swirl marks, and makes quick work of the VERY uneven pine stock I am working with. This sander uses a hook & loop type sanding media, so you have to be careful not to pick up the sticky back sanding media for this sander. The dust collection system uses the holes in the mounting pad and with them plugged up you are in for a dust storm in your shop! A quick swap to the right sanding media, full cleaning of the sander, and a retry resulted in much less dust, but still not low enough dust levels to not need a dust mask.Overall I am happy with the purchase. I do not believe there is a sander out there that has dust collection that works as advertised. This one is as good or better than the competitors in its category.
__label__1 Interesting as film history: But no comparison to the later version. I was surprised to see so much of the dialog the same.
__label__1 Disappointed: I was disappointed in this product. I purchased it to replace an older headset that I have had for years and was wearing out. When I first used this I noticed the sound volume and quality were much worse than I was used to. People I was meeting with via conference call said they could not hear me very well, which has never been a problem before. I am going back to my original one.
__label__1 False Advertising: Buyer beware. The flash page intices you with the prospect of receiving The Quatermass Experiment (The Creeping Unknown), 1956 - in addition to the 1979 TV version, Quatermass. Forget about it. Shameful false advertising. Amazon: take down the false advertising. Have you no shame.
__label__2 24 SEASON ONE: WONDERFULL , ONCE YOU WATCH 24 , THE REST OF TELEVISION IS JUST SOME THING TO WATCH UNTIL THE NEXT EPISODE OF 24 COMES ON. WITH THE DVD'S NO COMMERCIALS AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL NEXT WEEK. SEASON ONE PAVES THE WAY FOR THE REST.
__label__1 OK: This DVD is good in that it gets you up and moving. You will not learn how to box with this DVD. BUY THE EVERLAST DVDS with Michael Olajide.
__label__1 Not Durable: Although this is a cute idea, I would not recommend this for small children (which doesn't make sense because that is who it is for, right?). There are too many things to try to keep track of and too many ways it can be destoyed by little hands. This is one of those toys to keep on a high shelf and to only be looked at with adult supervision.
__label__2 One of the best developed characters in American fiction: I really enjoyed this book! The main character, Rhoda, is about as three-dimensional and full-bodied as any literary character deserves to be. A poignant and honest portrayal of a person who is a less than perfect human being, wife and mother. A book you can really sink your teeth into!
__label__2 Good steady pace: This workout does incorporate some cardio segments, which are not too complicated choreography wise, but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout. The compound movements (e.g., dips from the step with biceps, leg presses with delts) are challenging without making you anaerobic. The length (50 minutes) is good for a mid-week workout. Is it the most challenging weight workout? No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs. But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you're happy not being sore the next day. Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy. You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work. As in the other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline, unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down. This makes them very awkward to do, even with a mat on the incline.
__label__2 Great value, brute force: First off let me help you novices out there a little bit. Don't buy a video card because of its price, its hype, or its look, do your research! This card is excellent, it is blazingly fast, (it beats geforce 3), and it is a steal... BR>A key feature in the radeon 8500 is the programmable pixel shaders. Let me tell you a little more about them. Geforce 3, 4 and radeon 8500 all share them witht he exception with the Geforce 4 MX. The newest games will use programmable pixel shaders and if you don't have a video card that uses this, then you can't play it. The radeon beats its competition while being half the price! but be cautious because there has been driver issues with ATI and what seems to be "cheating drivers"Pros:blazingly fastcomes from a respectable companyexcellent image qualitycons:driver issues
__label__2 we like the golf course: Our grandson loves playing golf and we can play with him, too. It helps teach coordination and physical skills.
__label__1 Buy at your own risk: I strongly DONNOT recommend this manufacturer. The worst customer service I've seen in the web by iclick. After 2 moths of wait to get the replacement of my brand new, non-operating iclick 256 MB mp3 player, I received one of a lesser quality.
__label__1 didn't work: Could not use this in my smoke detector didn't seem to fit quite right. Looked like the same size length wise but is just a tad thick.
__label__2 Enjoyable pulp action novel: An enjoyable pastiche, "The Nimble Man" is an fast-moving action-adventure pulp novel in the best tradition of Doc Savage, The Shadow, The Spider, Tarzan, et. al. While it may be said that "They don't write 'em like that anymore," the evidence is to the contrary, 'cuz there's one right here. Time and again I felt a grin spread over my face as I recognized where the writers were going. And they seem to be having such a wonderful time getting there. If there's a fault to the book, it's perhaps the authors may be overreaching just a bit beyond their capabilities in a few places. Still, I can't wait for the next adventure of this thrilling troupe!
__label__1 Player/PC hangs when transferring files: I recently purchased an se510 from a local superstore. The 1st time I tried to transfer MP3s to the player using "Rio Music Manager" it froze both the player and my PC. Navigating to the RIO using "My Computer" also caused both the player and my PC to freeze. I spent ~45 minutes on the phone with RIO tech support. Very friendly and helpful but with no results. I was instructed to update "firmware" which resulted in the player/PC freeze occuring at a later stage of music transfer. Tech Support gave up and told me to contact Microsoft. Unfortunately now the player will not turn on. Luckily the local superstore accepts returns so I did not have to deal with RMA from Rio.
__label__1 Kiddie Bass: I picked up this bass thinking a short scale would help me out (I'm a female with smaller hands). My instructor about killed me! The single pick-up was terrible and NOT gig-worthy. Save a little more money, and do your homework before shelling out money for a bass.
__label__2 Perfect!: Love this product - It holds the EZ pass and I don't have to worry about peeling stickers off the windshield down the line! Thank you!
__label__2 just buy it!: You will regret not getting this book. It is a difficult task to capture the essence of Espana. This book comes closer than any, except perhaps Don Quixote!
__label__2 OMG!!! YES!!!: I was so HAPPY when they announced a re-release for this DVD. I was happy for many reasons.1. A great movie, DISNEY/PIXARS 1st moive2. I didn't get a chance to buy the 1st release, or the BOX SET3. Has lots of great features!!!4. It will be a two disc!!!!Let's hope rumors are ture that they are going to re-release TOY STORY 2 by the end of the year. I will also be buying that!!!Can't wait till Sept. 6!!!
__label__2 Cornwall,NY Sixth Grader: I am a sixth grader.I liked City Of Ember. It was exciting and made you wonder about the world. I think it would have been better with more action. The kids were not very intelligent either. The ending was twisting and I did not expect it.
__label__1 Frustrated in Texas: The unit simply did not work. I couldn't get it to work and neither could any friends or associates. The USB plug into the camera did not fit correctly. The phone number provided in the back of the instructions was "no longer in service" and the "contact us" portion of the web site was (unbelievably) inoperable. My adice is to STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY! JH
__label__2 How about a revised edition????: I love this series, and don't understand why it is out of print. Nature's God, in particular, is almost impossible to get a hold of (I found a copy via inter-library loan). Nature's God seemed a bit unfinished, like Wilson rushed it to the printers or something because he needed to make a mortgage payment. And so much for the "trilogy," because the story is left unfinished at the end of this book. In fact, readers are told to stay tuned for a book called Walls Come Tumbling Down, but that title gets used for a terrible docu-drama(?) set in modern times. If the author reads this review, I hope he will decide to revisit this series and work since I know their are many fans of Historical Illuminatus out there.
__label__2 Probably their best album: This was the frist NOFX album I heard and I still love it just as much today. The songs are funny, clever upbeat, exciting and really showcase NOFX's talent. If you like punk or pop-punk than this is definately a must have album for your collection.
__label__2 The pages kept turning: Great read, gives a good insight into the achievement of the British during the 2nd world war in cracking Enigma, a great feat of intellect and organisation.Book is a page turner, not quite as polished as some of his later work, but excellent nonetheless.
__label__1 Not a multiplayer game.: I think they did a fine job implying that you could play this game with more than one person. It is only the case if you want to play the rediculous side games, the game itself can only be played solo. The websites description of the game does not specify this, and neither do any of their trailers. Pretty lame.
__label__2 Great price and taste: The order came pretty quickly and it tasted great. The only issue was that the bars were melted and had to be put in the freezer to regain their shape.
__label__1 Poorly Built: This product is poorly built. The very first time we played with it, one of the plastic tubes broke off after being hit by a washer.
__label__1 Buyer beware: I am totally discusted with this CD. I bought it for one song "The Birth of the Beat" - A wonderful 10 minute performance. When I played it, I found out it was a cut down version (3 minutes). Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed.
__label__2 American Girl doll brush: Works great on American Girl doll hair. Always remember to wet hair before brushing. Much cheaper than buying AG products.
__label__2 Great!!: Very happy with the delivery, even when it took a bit longer to what I was expecting. I ordered a vintage one with a hard cover, I was a bit nervous as it's used one but it's in a great condition. Plus the book is very good if you want to start writing.
__label__2 CAUTION: Be prepared to actually publish your book when you read this, because Fern Reiss will show you how with a powerfully simple, day by day, action plan. The Publishing Game: Publish a Book in 30 Days is an excellent resource for those considering self-publishing. We use Fern's action plan in our publishing company, Morgan James Publishing, for every title we publish.
__label__2 Office 2007: I was very happy with the speed of delivery and the quality of this product. It was everything I was expecting.
__label__1 Disappointing: I read all the reviews and thought this would be a great game for my daughters and me. We all like Scrabble and have a strong math aptitude. Well, this game disappointed us in several ways: the instruction book is way too long and complicated to follow, the tiles are not nice wood tiles like Scrabble, and most important, we abandoned the game after 15 minutes because it wasn't very fun. On a friend's recommendation, I purchased Krypto, which is similar in concept but it is a card game. It has a short 1 page instruction sheet and it was fun off the bat while still being challenging and educational, and significantly cheaper.Original Krypto: Family Arithmetic Game
__label__2 Best read in quite a while: This book was written in 1962, but it comes thru the 48 years of techno changes with flying colors. I've read a few others of his - mostly thought they were mediocre to medium - turns out like a lot of other authors, their earlier works are their best. Guns of Navarone was #2, this is #9.
__label__2 Another excellent CD by 3D: I never have to preview a third day cd and they continue to impress me. I have yet to go wrong buying a CD by third day this one included!
__label__2 Best one: I'm a big guy. This is my third try at a comfortable bike seat. It is the best one so far. I totally recommend it.
__label__1 Gizmo an expensive piece of junk.: The product does not open very large cans. It stalls. The cutting blade assembly falls off. The product turns on when placing it in its holder. Don't buy it. A hand held manual opener works with any size can.
__label__1 big changes in computers: This book has much good (and I think correct) information on computers no longer for sale. Of antiquarian and nostalgia interest.
__label__1 WIERD!: I was watching this with my parents (im 12) until they made me leave the room do to a very detailed and graphic sex scene in which Justine has with Holden at a hotel.I could hear it though. Why do they have to make sex scences so detailed?? There was also another sex scene in which Justine has with Buba, her husbands best friend. You also see Bubas balls. Ewww...
__label__2 An Exceptional Collection of Poetry: This is an exceptional collection of Sufi poetry from a wide range of writers, some well known in the West and some fairly obscure. David and Sabrineh Fideler's translations are lovely and straight forward, and their choice of poems benefit both newcomers to Sufism and those looking for the deepest truths. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Linoleum is great!: I love linoleum. I have been colleting it for years. I am going to start a museum some day. This book is definitely the highlight of my linoleum reading! A must have for linoleum enthusiasts. Check it out!
__label__2 Still the Best Tannhauser on DVD: I will quickly say that this is still my favorite in my opinion the best Tannhauser on DVD. The production is lush and beautiful and the performers act excellently...Levine does a wonderful job conducting as well!5 stars
__label__1 Money Talks: Very disappointed that Money Talks will not play in my Blu Ray player? This was the main reason I purchased this DVD
__label__2 A Very Helpful Travel Guide: This book has all the information you could possibly need if you were travelling to Wyoming and my husband is thrilled we bought it. The maps inside are great, but since we prefer the larger ones, we will get them for free from the Wyoming visitor's bureau. If you're travelling to Wyoming, this is a definite must have and a one-stop source for all your information and travel needs.
__label__2 Better than I expected: Ok, Ciara wont go down in history as one of the great vocalists of our time. Her singing is definitely subpar. But the album is actually not that bad! I listened to it one day when I was bored and had nothing better to do and was surprised to find that I rather liked it, and have been playing it ever since! The beats are hot and even the lyrics are quite infectious. The entire album makes me reminscent of how I felt about all my crushes from my boycrazy young teenage days, especially "thugstyle" and "ooh baby". But almost every cut is listenable and will have you dancing and singing along. Overall, its just a fun, feel-good album
__label__2 This CD rocks the house!!: I have seen this band play live, I have their CD and I still can't get enough of them. Their music is inovated, creative and funky. I can't wait for the next CD.
__label__1 Beautiful but with an Achilles heel: I love the look of this canister. Sitting on my counter, keeping my coffee beans dry and fresh. Aesthetically it's extremely gratifying. Functionally however, it leaves something to be desired. Closing the canister top takes a few tries every time to be sure the lid is lining up correctly with the cannister, otherwise the lid sits funny. Also the tab to lock the lid in place is extremely flimsy and if you push too hard on it, will bend leading me to believe that it will soon snap off leaving me with a jagged edge my thumb will enjoy trying to push down to seal the lid. SO that's exciting.
__label__1 Waste of money: I tried it for 2 weeks morning/night. No difference. Burned slightly but I literally could tell zero difference in my skin condition. Waste of money. Would never order again.
__label__1 Vendor copied this from a really bad VHS tape: I was so excited to find that 'The Clowns' was finally available on DVD. And then I got this thing. Worst quality ever in a DVD. What a gross dereliction of decency to sell the Maestro's wonderful film in this way. DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.
__label__2 Awsome coffeemaker: We needed a new coffee grinder. Having used Capresso in the past with tremendous success, that is where I started looking. Well - what could be better than a "full service" coffee maker? Fill with beans, add water, set the timer and go to bed. The beans grind FRESH and the coffee is brewed immediately. No oxidation of the coffee - all the flavor remains!We just got it all set up yesterday and it was as "easy as pie"! Be sure to watch the video provided as it is VERY clear. We like good strong coffee and that is my only complaint. Even on max cups, it is still a little weak. I think we can work it out by adjusting the grind setting. If not, we can change to a heartier coffee bean.This is a great coffee grinder/maker if you like FRESH ground coffee.
__label__1 Lousy RF range; ON worked from further away than OFF: The range of use was practically useless. I could get about 10 - 15 feet of range for the "ON" button, but had to put the remote right against the receiver to get the "OFF" to even work. I bought this particular model because it had discrete on and off buttons, to make it easier for my elderly mom to figure out (was supposed to be used to remotely reboot her cable modem located in the basement), but in the end it was too flaky to let her fuss with it. I switched to a different unit which had about 50 feet of consistent, reliable range and tossed this one in the junk drawer.
__label__2 Awesome designs: For those who want something fun to crochet for babies (without making the same old boring pastel stuff) - you have to check out this book...It's awesome! Candi's designs rock! It's my favorite and the most used book in my crochet library, and even as a beginner crocheter, I was able to make a number of items from her book without a problem!!! Totally fun and hip coats and sweaters, Ugg-style baby booties with a matching hat and jacket, crocheted dresses, even a kimono-styled dress and sweater set! Totally fun and worth every penny!
__label__2 Leticia: This is a very nice ring for this price. The stone is suspended in a bridge-like style. It gives the impression of a very expensive ring. It looked really large to me in the picture, but it is of average size. If you like Iolite, you will really appreciate it.
__label__1 out of stock?? -50 points.: I ordered a Kindle. Now I wait, and wait, and wait some more. Why is a highly hyped item allowed to be out of stock without even so much as an estimated ship date? Part of the charm of a Kindle is not having to wait for a book to be delivered. So to have to wait to even be told when the Kindle will be delivered is utterly maddening.
__label__2 excelente: good producto,,, buen precio,, rapido envio,,, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si pequeño,buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo
__label__1 Made in China: When I saw the "made in China" on the packaging, I should have sent them back unopened. I was desperate to have socks without spandex and latex in so I kept them. That was a big mistake. I don't know what was in those socks, but if you are looking to buy these socks because of allergies, save your money. I bought them because so many people with allergies claimed they were good. I don't know when Buster Brown moved their manufacturing to China, but these socks are toxic. I had to give them 1 star because zero wasn't an option.
__label__2 Helping to cope: After recently losing my sister to suicide, I signed up for a support group called SOS (Survivers of Suicide). They sent me this book to read. My heart went out to this mother and her grief. She addresses all the questions you have in your mind after you expierience death by suicide, but you are afraid to say them out loud. She explains how your feelings are normal and there is no right or wrong way to act. Sue Chance has allowed me to put some of my anger and grief into percpective. This book has given me the strength to continue on without my sister.
__label__2 Great Toy: I love having Bristle Blocks in my classroom, it really helps student use their motor skills. This set is great. I really like how it comes in it's own storage container. That is really helpful. I would recommend this to anyone!
__label__1 a Trevanian potboiler without the razor: If you enjoy the fetishization of firearms, the eroticization of violence, and the cheezification of Faulknerian language, this novel is for you. It's Trevanian and Alistair MacLean with lots of italicized homespun wisdom. Macarthy's reputation is puzzling: his dialogue is hokey, his prose is impoverished American modernism (like Faulkner he likes to skip the apostrophe in contractions; like Joyce he eschews quotation marks), his characterizations are utterly uninteresting from a psychological perspective. This is not to say that he does not construct readable books. I gulped this one down right quick. But it's tripe.
__label__2 Excellent the real truth behind Michael Moore's Movie: This movie shows what really the facts are, half of them left out in Moore's movie. Most interesting is Dick Morris who was working with the Clinton administration. As he puts it: If Bush was to be blamed for 8 months into the office, when 9/11 happened, Clinton should have been blamed for 8 years. Under the Clinton administration, 8 of the 9/11 terrorist were identified as suspects; officials working for Clinton asked him to go after them, but Clinton only accepted a solution to make sure whenever the "suspects" travel, their luggage travel along with them (because that's what brought down PanAm 103 back in the 80s).It is also very interesting to see people who were in Fahrenheit 9/11 critisizing Moore not showing what they were really saying, i.e. Moore edited their interviews to present his own view. The victims feel betrayed by Moore, and as one person puts its, Moore is nothing but just an "Ambulance Chaser".
__label__1 Horrible: Purchased this game as a family Christmas present - for two teen-agers, two adults and two grand-parents. We usually play board games or card games after meals - and have a great time. This game brought the fun to a halt. After about 10 minutes the two teen-agers and one grand-parent said, "this is boring" - and asked to play something else. Game is confusing to play (arguments over who said what last, who repeated someone else's word) - and just not fun. Three generations agreed it was something we would not ever play again - and we switched to Balderdash!
__label__1 OK: Though Buckland did give a plethora of useful information is Obsession o himself and his own accomplishments distracted from the book as it became more about vanity of his own doings rather than a Craft instruction
__label__1 Ehhhh.: Typical Chinese quality item. Missing some hardware, flaky paint, tray has thin sheet metal, etc. Mine was missing hardware to attach the door handle, the cabinet also did not have the drawers as pictured and the tray was bent in two places. I just took a pair of pliers and fixed the bent edges since the paint was already flaking off on the tray and cabinet. I just need it to hold some basic hand tools and small items while working, if you need it for anything more than that look elsewhere.
__label__2 Works as described. Great!: I bought this little mount and received it in 2 days. Very easy setup. Took it out of the box, unwrapped it, and put the mount on the base (takes 1/2 a second) and attached my Garmin GPS to the mount (another 1/2 a second). I took it out to the car, put it on the dashboard and drove around taking sharp turns. No sliding at all! It's awesome! Everything I expected :) Genius invention. No more gross spit marks on the windshield where my other windshield mount used to go. Also no more GPS falling off the window and scaring the crap out of me when I'm driving. Happy customer here!
__label__1 Slow, long and repetitive: How could this novel be nominated for a Man Booker Prize? I've read lots of books, and some I don't like very much but at least I can appreciate the structure and the beauty in the writing. Not with this one. It didn't produce anything... not a tear, a laugh or a thrill... flat story, flat characters, rainy days, slow, long, repetitive and predictable.
__label__1 Where is Capitol Hill????: the map is portable,durable, but limited in its' scope. i plan on staying and touring the Capitol Hill Historic Area, parks and cemeteries nearby, but this map cuts this area off. disappointed!
__label__1 Sizes don't work for females: I was excited to get these gloves due to the reviews. I need gloves that actually keep my hands warm without sweating so I don't have to pull them off while running. These were supposed to do that. However, the size of the gloves are just too large for my hands & I don't have super tiny hands; rather, I have average size hands. There weren't any other sizes, so I was extremely disappointed.
__label__2 As The River Needs The Banks To Flow, So...: As the river needs the banks to control its flow, so the soul needs destiny to channel freedom. This metaphor captures the nature of this fascinating book for me. May does not disparage one over the other. For him, license is the corruption of freedom, and fate is the corruption of destiny. He states that true psychological freedom grows out of destiny (or having a destination) and in having a destiny, we are free to grow in spirit and in mind.I underlined as I read. It seems to be the best way to read a book by May. He has a cogent writing style and never lags. (I particularly enjoyed his blasting of the behavioralist school of psychology, but that's just my thing.) Any student of psychology should read this book; May has provided a balance in therapy, he writes to establish the fulcrum which should hold the conflicts and conflicting ideas in level balance.Take the time to sift this book. I hope that you will find it as valuable as I have.
__label__2 Three Legged "Dogs" Ain't Half Bad!: With the untimely passing of Gene Eugene, I wondered how well the next project from Lost Dogs would turn out, or if they would even continue to record without him. 'Real Men Cry' definitely lacks Gene's contribution, but with Terry Taylor's creative genius, it is a toe-tapping collection of country style numbers with a touch of bluegrass (In fact, every time I listen to the CD, I picture myself sitting on the front porch in a rocking chair with a cold glass of lemonade in hand, head bobbing in rhythm to the music). Harmonic vocals and great guitar work permiate each track. And once again, Terry's lyrical talent shines. NO SHADOW OF TURNING is my favorite tune, but A CERTAIN LOVE comes in a close second. I get the impression that Terry was thinking of the band when he penned THREE LEGGED DOG and it seems he's returning to his 'roots' with the style of music performed on this and the last project 'Gift Horse'.
__label__2 SCREENPLAY BY THE AUTHOR: I read that novel a few years ago,and this film i beleive does it justice.The fact that the author himself did the adaptation to the screen helps a lot;after all it is his baby.Previous adaptations of JOHN IRVING'S books(THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP and THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE(a mess))were not of the same quality.There are however two points i want to single out here:the fact that HOMER can practice medecine with a fake diploma is rather hard to take;it is also never explain to us why the doc(MICHAEL CAINE)always needs ether to find some sleep.Is he a drug addict?Personnaly,i would have cut the episode of the black man having made his own daughter pregnant,but it helps us to understand that HOMER has not lost what he had learned before.
__label__2 Yummy: This works great in our popcorn maker. It makes the popcorn have the great movie popcorn look. A must buy.
__label__1 Good movie. Horrendous DVD transfer - AVOID!: This is a charming film with good performances. It reads like a precursor to Aaron Sorkin's "West Wing," except Martin Sheen is the best friend in this one. Michael Douglas is president.HOWEVER, the DVD transfer on this disc is fairly notorious on DVD review sites as being one of the worst ever created. You would be doing yourself a disservice by buying this disc. Get the VHS tape or wait for a new edition on DVD.
__label__1 Good Story but the Main Character Sucks: I am late in starting this series but I just have to comment on this book.The story is great and I love where it is going however, Rachel, the main character, is the worst written character I have ever read and I have been reading for a LONG time. The first 3 books she was bad but this one, she is horrible and I am debating on continuing because of her.Rachel Morgan aka Witch, is flat out stupid! She is a condensending, self centered moron and the way the author explains away her faults is just rediculous.I have the next book in the series so I will read that one but if the character of Rachel does not change, it will be the last one I read in this series because as much as I like the story and the secondary characters, I just cant stomach Rachel. I find myself throwing the book down in disgust.
__label__1 What a waste....: This series has been one of the biggest disappointments I have had for awhile. Fairly poorly written in general, it just went down hill so far with popularity. These guys stretched it out to make money...more and more money (I hope they have used it to do the Lord's will). I beleive this series was pushed heavily as an evangelism tool and became popular because it was more fun to read than the other books trying to "save" people.If Christians or others would like to read quality books on fictional charachters and ideas with biblically inclined story lines, check out the Christ Clone series. These three books are so far beyond the Left Behind garbage. Left Behind may have gotten a 3 or 4 star rating it it were cut down to 3 books or so. How much can a story be tacked onto to extend for more $$?
__label__2 Don't need ballet experience! Great workout: I have and love both this DVD & the Booty Barre Abs & Arms. They're both challenging but fun. I noticed a couple of reviews talking about ballet experience. I have zero ballet experience and I can do these. Granted, I am pretty flexible, no injuries of any kind. I like the flexibility component of her booty barre workouts. Also, doing a lot of leg work works out your abs. I want all her DVDs.
__label__2 No techie degree required: Product is easy to install. Plug in the provided cables and the system (WinXP) recognizes as a new drive called "FreeAgent Drive". Unit powers off when PC is shut down. Quiet (you can't hear the drive spin) and does not get warm. I'd buy another if I needed another 465GB. The 5yr warranty is a nice piece of mind....just in case.
__label__2 Continues where the other Artemis Fowl books leave off!: This series is a good introduction to sci fi thrillers for the younger reader. And anything that gets them to read and not drain their brain in front of the TV or video game is a plus.This book reads easy but not too simple so it will keep their interest. Probably better suited for a boy than girl, as it continues with a steady diet of flatulence humor, as did its predecessor.This story surrounds Opal Koboi. It involves clones, high tech gadgets, and takes the young reader on a journey of Fowl after his mind has been erased of memories of faries and the such.If your child liked the first books, he will enjoy this one as well.
__label__2 Great: Easy to transport. All over waikiki on it! Very well made and stable. I was apprehensive but am now very pleased!
__label__1 Something was overlooked!: Before making my purchase I read other customer reviews and decided this was a good choice. Was I the only one that did not appreciate the fact that my 12 cup coffee maker water reservoir only had the capacity to hold 9 cups? Does this make any sense? Not to me. When I ordered a 12 cup coffee maker I expect to be able to brew 12 cups. Unhappy to say the least.
__label__1 41 inches: I bought this because it was one of the few gates that seemed like it would fit my 42 inch opening. Nope...good for 41 inches, but not 42. Sent it back.
__label__1 Going to take the pain to Vince.: Vince will pay for his evil doing junky son of the b***h that he his. I don't even like that guy at all & he's gonna get his ass kick in the jaw by HBK, I can't wait! So, this is the game that everyones been dying to have, IDIOTS! Theres nothing fun here in this rusty crap, just regular game like a child would play. So go get South Park instead, thats enjoyable!
__label__1 waste of money: My Professor has the answer book where all the ads are rated and answers are given. Also, he got color transparencies. How come they don't include this in the package?! (I don't mean Amazon) The book is really bad! The illustrations are black and white which is terrible! The quality of the paper is cheap! I regret I bought this book.
__label__2 Desperado: I loved this soundtrack and I loved the movie - very enjoyable listening and humorous in parts - I recommend it.
__label__2 this is amazing: this film was amazing. it is like no other thing i have seen. although it does relate to alot of ideas given by D.C. and JG ballard. it is somthing totally new visually and idea wise. buy... this movie anyway for you to see it. it shows you what you can do with a camera. i'm watching it again.
__label__1 Good movie if you have Insomnia....: Okay so I figured I would rent it just to give it a shot and needless to say thank goodness I rented and didn't buy. It was okay, cheesy at times and pretty predictable. Great to watch if you need something to fall asleep to.
__label__1 Learn it is a waste of money: As with all Barbie toys this comes with a million little pieces. Definitely not something that you want if you have younger children in the house.This toy is absolutely a waste of money. It is cheaply made. The "chalk board" comes apart constantly, the piece of cardboard that goes in it constantly comes out and gets trampled on or torn up.There are many pieces to this toy that get lost in the carpet or stepped on.This toy is very cheaply made.
__label__1 mistake: To order this from the seller was a mistake. The product was not as advertised (quite inferior). My e-mail to the seller after receiving the product was never acknowledged nor has a refund been forthcoming (I returned the product). This is always a danger but is my first bad experience. This is an entirely negative review.
__label__1 Waste of $: Used this machine only 10 times on my upstairs hallway carpet. It completely stopped suctioning leaving me with a dirty, smelly, wet carpet. Called customer service & was told that there was only 1 service center in the entire city of San Antonio. Chances are I won't even bother making the drive.
__label__1 andy andricci,retired cook: The pots looked beautiful when i first opened the box,the smallest pot had two black spots in the bottom of the pot,after boiling two hot dogs the pot was discolored.I placed the pot in the dish washer and at the end of the washing and drying cycle,I removed the pot and the inside was tarnished.I tried to remove the brown stain with no luck.I have not used the other pots,I am hoping that this does not repeat this problem when using them.
__label__1 ooops. Amazon didn't send it to me!: I ordered this book after being "assured" it would arrive between Feb 8-12. When I placed the order, it was to arrive on Feb 15. I was on vacation--and leaving the 15th. But we waited....and waited...and waited. No book delivery. We left for home! When I wrote to Amazon after I got home, they said "give it another week!" I was 1200 miles away by then--first time I've ordered a book from Amazon and probably the last! Thank goodness for my local library! Got the book before the book club actually met!
__label__1 stupid and dangerous: I didn't find this a bit entertaining, insightful or compassionate. This book is a piece of garbage and junk science, wrapped in a pretty package that panders to obese individuals. Obesity is a disease that eventually affects all organs and leads to morbidity and premature death. Trying to justify obesity in any shape or form while making it "acceptable" is criminal and dangerous. There are medical criteria for obesity and if you fit those, go seek professional help rather than waste time and money on books such as this one.
__label__2 cash's last CD: First time i heard the songs I was a fan. A man at the end of his journey at peace with God and man, and that is reflected in each song. An old man still full of music and having fun with it .. as far as I am concerned, this CD has got meditational value as well. Peaceful but full of life at the same time .. I love it!
__label__2 Good Brand: Last at least a year of constant use, before dulling. Have to be careful that the spring doesn't get knocked out, vs, some other versions, with the other style.
__label__1 Do not buy this DVD !: I was very disapointed with the DVD, the image and sound quality are very poor, the interviews are useless. The one and only DVD you should buy is the "All Excess" .
__label__1 Disappointed: When this product arrived I opened the box and it smelled like the product andthe jar was all greasy.I could not tell if was from the jar itself or if itcam from a case that had a broken jar in it.It looked like it was sealed butit did not pop when I opened it.This does not make me comfortable with using it.Need I say more.Do you want a satisfied customer? Or not.
__label__2 glad I ordered this: I had heard that lanolin was best for dry skin so decided to order this. It came very quickly and well packed. It works great on my dry skin. I was concerned about the scent but it is very mild and pleasant. It is not oily, soaks in quickly and my skin stays soft longer. Glad I bought this and will be ordering it again.
__label__2 Franklin Sports 2774 MLB heavy duty professional batting tee: Very sturdy tee. The only thing is that the way the top of the tee is designed it is a little hard to keep the baseball on it. You have to have patience as it takes skill and a little luck to place the ball.
__label__1 Why Did Grizzly Bother Manufacturing this Tool?: I have NEVER had more difficulty with any power tool in my 50 plus years of buying and using tools. I have had more problems getting this power tool up and running than anything I have ever bought. The manual of instructions for assembly is woefully incomplete. I suspect that a novice would never have been able to get the machine running. While I now have it running, it still requires more adjustment and modification. All I can say is the person who designed it either is not a woodworker or this is the first time they ever designed a power tool. Clearly that person never tried to use it after it was on the market. In conclusion I can only say I would not recommend this sander to anyone and plan to send more detailed comments with pictures to Grizzly. Allan Furman, Deerfield Beach, FL
__label__2 A must read for 2009: To all citizens of America, this is a MUST read book. You need to see how this country was led by a man of character because we certainly do not have it in the current group in Washington DC.Peggy Noonan does her usual stellar job of bringing Reagan's words and deeds to life. She crafts her stories about Reagan in such a way as to make you feel you know him on the same level she was!
__label__2 High energy: This DVD is one of the few that actually gets my 3 year old up and moving while it is on. He loves to run to "I'm gonna catch you" or throw a beach ball around to "Under a Shady Tree". The cinematography is pretty basic but he doesn't seem to notice.
__label__1 Not Satisfied: I ORDERED NAVY SOCKS AND GOT WHITE SOCKS... MY HUSBAND NEEDED THESE SOCKS FOR HIS FOOTBALL GAME AND THIS IS WHAT HE RECIEVED. THANKS
__label__1 InAliennable: The concept as potencial,the drama does not make you believe in the actor`s.To much missing part the story goes to fast, that make you feel lost.The movie as grate actor, but the exageration of the caractor make you feel like they dont belong in that type of story.G.
__label__2 A trip to bountiful: It is such a pleasant escape to go to Job's Crossing, Texas, and spend a little time with Biggie and J.R., to go down to the tea room and schmooze with the patrons--maybe have a piece of chocolate pie. The plot isn't too much, as mysteries go, but who cares? The characters and the atmosphere are what a reader needs after all the bloody violence of mysteries that top the best seller lists. I'm not usually a great fan of "cozy" whodunits; still, from time to time they are the perfect antidote. Nancy Bell knows her place and people well, and I enjoy going with her.
__label__2 looks bigger in the picture: Just to let everyone know, this item is smaller than it looks. Much smaller. so are the bratz babyz.
__label__2 the fight over music: Holloway's book is a wonderful introduction to what the history of western political philosophy says about the role of music in shaping people's character. The belief that music has a role in forming the character has always been a controversal stance, starting with Plato, and remains one still today. One only has to be reminded of Allan Bloom's chapter on Rock music and the reaction that section provoked shows how powerful this theme remains today. Liberals (ancient and modern, capitalist or not) don't like the idea that music plays a role in character formation.. and what Holloway's book does shows the reader what the big stars of western philosophy has to say on this subject. Holloways argues by ignoring the power of music in the formation of character of the young especially, contemporary society and the music it has bread.. has lead to extremes both in music and people's character.. and both for the worse.
__label__1 This book is a big disappointment!: I cannot suggest to anyone that this would be a good read. It was rather boring, not nearly as exciting as his other works.Avoid this one!
__label__1 Buyer Beware - Smells like a knock-off: Buyer beware! I've been wearing Chanel's Allure Sensuelle for a couple of years and it's my favorite scent. It has a very distinct and deep fragrant. I can no longer find it in stores, so I was excited when I found it on Amazon through one of their vendors. I am very disappointed with what I received, it really smells like some knock-off brand. If it was a Chanel original, it is extremely old. The scent is very faint, almost one-dimensional, and does not stay.
__label__1 OK but very expensive for what you get.: These are basically stackable cardboard (reinforced) storage boxes They are strong and well made, work pretty well, and get the job done. However, I think the price is *very* expensive for what you get. I use them in a walk-in closet and they work ok for that purpose.
__label__1 i don't see why everyone is so caught up with leo: i think its' kind of sick to write books about a person who has contributed nothing to our society except enertainment, which has too high priority in america. we paly athletes and entertainers tremendously high wages, and yet there are still starving people in this world. waht is wrong with the world today?
__label__2 Works: I bought this product because I have sun spots on the upper parts of my cheekbones and forehead. I had heard that this product's ingredients are not as harsh as a lot of the skin lightening products on the market. I've been using this product for about a month (2 times a day when I remember) and it has helped lighten the sun damage considerably. I don't know if the sun spots will ever be completely gone. But I've started using dermablend foundation which has worked out well to help cover what still remains. I have very pale porcelean like skin and with the help of this and the dermablend my skin looks almost perfect.
__label__1 If you don't understand already, this book doesn't help.: After reading this book, I still didn't know how to insert an e-mail address or jpeg into my web page. It did not provide step-by-step direction and certainly did not help you when things don't work as easily as the book claims. Not as good as the QuarkXPress Quickstart. A waste of money. I had to go back and find another book. Langer also has an annoying habit of writing "I discuss topic X in chapter X" every other sentence, which splatters you all over the book when you're trying to research a problem.
__label__2 The CORRECT Tracks on this release...: This is actually a vinyl 12" single, with the following tracks:Side A...Passing ByMonday - Paracetamol (Mojave 3 Remix)Side BIn All The Wrong PlacesWherever You AreThe tracks listed are actually for the Manitoba/Caribou release "Start Breaking My Heart"To my knowledge, this is the only release with the Mojave 3 (former members of Slowdive) remix of Monday - Paracetamol.
__label__2 Fantastic: Loved this book. A super great read! I feel like I know Mr. Franzese now. What an awesome witness to the Lord! I would recommend this book anyone who is searching for answers.
__label__1 Just Bad...: I will avoid talking about songs 2-4, and I will just focus on 'These Boots Are Made For Walking'(which will make this a short review something I am prone to do when I when reviewing items).When I first saw the video, I was shocked. I mean Horifically shocked. First of all the song was barely inaudible (or maybe it was just me) and I had too put the volume on my TV all the way. Jessica being know for her crazy ballads going crazy with her voice is not doing that here, which makes the song boring. The dance moves and her bikini shot at the end just disgusted me. I detest that celebreties use their bodies to gain attention and make some money.(Or as most celebreties say "Not ashamed of showing their sexiness" etc...or some other moderation of it.)Anyways have a nice day &, Ciao
__label__2 DC's Best!: Another classic from DJ Kool who always has jamin party music. The title cut is a party starter every where it is played.
__label__1 might be deliscious BUT CLEARLY misslabeled: Pasteurized MIlk is not RAW milk. I have no opinion on the taste of this product, but I stay clear of companies who try to defraud me by mislabeling their products
__label__2 As fresh today as it was 30 years ago: "Rock 'n' Roll Animal" is the second-best live rock LP of all time (right behind Warren Zevon's "Learning to Flinch"). Oddly, the addition of bonus tracks on this reissue detracts from, rathers than adds to, the album. Leave them off when you transfer the CD to your iPod.
__label__1 outrageous: Don't waste your money. More than half of this little paperback book is exercises. I was astounded to find a little card in the book asking me to send $3.50 to obtain the answers to the exercises!! After paying $20.00 for a book that is clearly overpriced. If you want a textbook, look at one of the many others that are better and have better prices -- and include the exercise answers.
__label__1 not for me: Tasteless - for someone with diet restrictions or allergies only, otherwise stick with another brand.
__label__1 bad paper quality: the book is printed on recycled toilet paper, the colors are dull. is it really necessary to rip people off this way? is DC comics so poor?
__label__1 Readings Inaccurate: This scale was relatively accurate up to 13 lbs at which point it is over a pound off. I had reservations buying this initially for my baby since this scale is made in China and is so cheap. If you are buying this to breastfeed forget it, not only is it inaccurate, but it doesn't measure small changes well. Overall, I felt I wasted my money on this.
__label__1 Bargain book purchase: I had this title saved in my shopping cart for weeks. I had read all the reviews for this book and all were encourging except maybe one or two. Thankfully I hadn't made my purchase because I caught a glimpse of "The Toddler Busy Book" under a stack of books at my local bargain store.I was going to purchase this book on amazon but I'm glad I didn't. I paid $1.98 and got my money's worth. Some of the activities are thoughtful and creative. But most are symplistic and unimaginative. -I wouldn't need some one to suggest giving my toddler a full kleenex box so they could pluck out every tissue for ammusement.
__label__1 Kid's hat a so-so product: Hat is one size - not adjustable. Tight fit fir an 8-year old girl. I would recommend looking for an adjustable size hat.
__label__1 generic review, for a generic soundtrack, for a generic movie: What the hell is it about summer and a corny movie about dancing that involves some dude who totally doesn't fit in. but threw his dancing abilities he shows everyone they're wrong about him. Every summer we have one of these "feel good" movies that involves a ton of dancing. The soundtrack is what I'm revewing though, where do I begin? Oh, I know, how about most of these songs don't go together. We've reached a point where "Now that's Pop" cd's are huge sellers. I'm not saying these songs are bad (some are, some aren't) but most don't really fit. Random good songs make for a pretty bad soundtrack. There is no flow here, it's too all over the place for me. The Sean Paul & Keyisha Kole song is pretty smooth, as are a few others. As a soundtrack it doesn't work though.
__label__1 Couldnt stand it!: This is the nicer, prettied up, cosy version of Dangerous Liasions with the happier ending. I just personaly found it quite light weight and crass, and the story was weakened with all the tragedy, evil and complexity taken out of it- so as not to disturb tiny minds. It seems like it has been dumbed down in an attempt to appeal to the Hollywood market, despite not being as well known as the infinitely superior "Dangerous Liasons" that stared Glenn Close and John Malkovich. Although the cast had some good actors, their performances where patchy as if they hadn't quite got into character yet and the whole plot seemed rushed through like a dress rehearsal. But I know some people who love this version, so I guess it's just horses for courses.
__label__1 MSW 2004 comes up SHORT: You don't get the newest version of Word with this suite. In typical Microsoft fashion, they are sticking you with the older Word 2002. They have included the 2004 versions of Money, Encarta, Streets & Trips but not Word. If there was a generous rebate offered on this software it might be appealing. But packaging old applications with new adds a bit of stench to this suite. Avoid it.
__label__2 d-link wireless bluetooth usb adapter just works!: I have an older mac (ibook) that did not have bluetooth. I did a lot of research and determined the d-link wireless bluetooth usb adapter dbt-120 was the tool for the job. It was delivered quickly, I plugged it in, and it just works! Absolutely great! I am using it to connect to my blackberry 8830, and using tethering to get online.
__label__1 We've heard it before...: Well, I know that Ministry's career was/is supposed to end in a trilogy of anti-Bush albums. I guess if you like a lot of protest/political music, then that's something that works for you. I also realize that Al has made political music throughout his career. As for me: Enough is enough. The most "new" thing about the album is more of a metal sound than most of his works, but that's not a major difference really. Some of it is good, but it's not the most memorable album and the concept wears thin as you're listening to the album. We get the point, and it won't be changed for another two years, but come on: This is nothing particularly special. As the other reviewer said, "Greater Wrong of the Right" by Skinny Puppy was a much better leftist album than the two more recent from Ministry, and I actually enjoyed "Molé", since that was also diverse and artistically interesting. This is just more of the same and it's not even interesting this time around. Next...
__label__1 Don't waste your money!: Piece of junk. This product is so poorly constructed I consider it completely defective and hazardous to use.
__label__1 Pure garbage!: This is nothing but rightwing propaganda. Pure lies. But hey, its what the right wing does best. LIE.~~~~~ Junk, not worth squat and a waste of time.
__label__1 Top fell off after 3.5 years: We have used our kettle daily for 3.5 years which is pretty rigorous use but I would prefer it if small appliances weren't disposable. When the top stopped flipping up it was only a week before it fell off altogether. I'm going to try a Russell Hobbs kettle next time around.
__label__1 graco jumper broken cable: when baby first jumped, one of the 3 cables broke, was not useful. I returned it
__label__2 MRS. PARKS DOES IT AGAIN: ELECTA ROME PARKS DELIVERS ANOTHER PAGE TURNER IN ALMOST DOESN'T COUNT. THIS BOOK IS A GREAT READ WITH UNEXPEXTED PLOT TWISTS THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE.
__label__1 Mind-numbing: Many kids movies are at least tolerable, if not somewhat entertaining, for adults. Not this one. My 8 year old son loved it though.
__label__2 Java for the world wide web was a good book.: Java for the world wide web thought me the basics of Java programming. But, the book doesn't really tell you where to get a Java compiler. And I wouldn't recomend asking Dori her self.
__label__1 Waste of $: First time I inserted a disc ( DVD +R) and tried to initialize, machine shut off. Tried it again, same thing only now it's locked up. Had to unplug the power cord to reset. Called Samsung and was told to try a DVD -R. One reason I bought it was the fact that it used ALL formats. A friend suggested I go to the Samsung site and download firmware updates. I figured, I pay that much for something, it should work right out of the box. Sent it back next day. No problems there, thanks, Amazon.
__label__2 Suzuki: Extremely fast shipping. I could not believe how quickly the item was shipped and I received.
__label__2 A decoration with which to decorate: It's pretty cool looking, exactly what I was looking for. If this product intrigues you, buy it. It's definitely worth the price.
__label__1 Please Don't use this Book: This is the only book that the AAP lists as dangerous.It goes against instinct, and can hurt your baby.Ezzo's grown children no longer talk to him ... I think that says it all.
__label__1 Unhappy: The base comes loose from the main frame and I suspect that's why it's a Re-con. They should have done a better re-con or not at all!!!!!
__label__1 big mistake: Hi I just bought this shaving cream, thinking it would smell good. I was so wrong it smells so bad I am urging you not to waste your money, you will regret it. I can't really tell you what it smells like but it's bad. The shaving cream itself works just fine but the odor is just awful, save your money and don't buy it
__label__2 Not Bad.: Decent story line even though a couple things didn't make sense (the adults couldn't notice a giant alien just on the other side of the house from them?) but the CGI was done well and it's a fun movie to watch. Good for the whole family which is a BIG plus in my book especially now a days.
__label__1 Fumio Demura DVD set - DAMAGED DVD's: I have bought several copies of each. Onlyvolume 1 works in Macbook Pro. All the rest are damaged and will not play to end. One won't even play from beginning.I can not recommend the DVD's Sensei Demura's Martial Arts however are excellent. I have known him since he came to the USA since 1965/Dr Zarlengo
__label__2 General Overview: This game is. . . well to be honest, expansive. There are about, oh, 12 basic weapons give or take. Then you have four more powerful versions of that weapon. Then you get into the legendary weapons, which there are quite a few of. There are a dozen characters each of which can be customized. The human/newman characters have 18 different outfits. The android characters each have 25 metal/paint stylings. There are, I'm going to say again, 12 different levels in Episode 1. I cannot tell you how many there are in the second, seeing as I have not yet completed it.There is also an interesting unit which hovers above your shoulder, known as a MAG. When it first evolves it will change depending on your class. So there are only three evolutions at first, but then it becomes a whole lot more complex.
__label__2 I can't wait for Elliott's CD: I first heard Moody's Mood for Love sung by Linda Ronstandt and fell in love with it . . . and to be sung by MY IDOL ELLIOTT in the show was sooooooooooo soooooo fantastic! He really should have been the AMERICAN IDOL! I LOVE THIS CD!
__label__2 De'Longhi EC155 15 Espresso & Capp Maker purchased at Amazon: Most everything about this machine is great, good size, good steam, rich coffee. However, I noticed that the first cup of the morning came out cold, not warm or hot! So I had to run the water thru the machine as if I was making the coffee, without the coffee, and once the water had cycled thry the pipes, the second came out nice and hot. Has any one else experienced this "machine needs to warm up first" problem??Also, I tried to get my rebate and got ready to send in all the papper work, however the shipping box from Amazon did not have an invoice in it, which is needed to get the rebate. I tried to get someone on line to send me an invoice to no avail. It appears that we are tempted by the good rebates to purchase something but it becomes so difficult to cash in!!!!Linda
__label__1 Too Much Cumin: I thought I tried something different rather than just plain old potato chips. The cumin flavor was very strong in one bag while another bag was light in cumin (and better for my taste buds). The flavor was just too overwhelming for me. I would not buy this product again.
__label__2 As Advertised: I purchased these for long term storage of digital photos and music based on recommendations found on the internet. I've made several DVDs and all have worked fine. I also plan to convert old VHS family tapes to DVD using these.
__label__2 Remember, this is FICTION!: People seem to expect the characters and events in Harris' books to appear real and believable. This is FICTION! They aren't real and neither are the events. Ultimately I think Harris does a good job of telling stories that have the ability to make one's skin crawl and have us looking over our shoulder for whatever spooky reason. I thought "Hannibal" got off to a disappointing start, but after the first few chapters I began to enjoy it for exactly the same creepy feelings I got when I read "Silence of the Lambs." Hannibal Lecter's character fascinates me because he is so creepy! I admire Harris for conjuring up characters such as Hannibal and Mason Verger, to allow our imaginations to run wild. The ending surprised me, and in fact I had to read the last few pages twice to make sure there wasn't some sublety I might have missed the first time. It definitely leaves room for another sequel!
__label__2 Great writer, great book: I've long been fan of Bill Lyon, as a reader of the Philadelphia Inquirer, but was unaware of this book. I saw it referenced in one of his columns awhile back so I bought it on the strength of his talent alone. If you're a fan of great sportswriting, you won't be disappointed. And I'm not even that much of a football fan.
__label__1 Overpowering baby corn flavor: I have a high opinion of other TastyBite foods and I enjoy Thai food so I thought I'd give this a try. It is very bad. The sauce contains green beans, baby corn and potatoes. Unfortunately, the flavor of the baby corn overpowers everything, including the relatively bland flavor of the curry, making the whole dish very unappetizing. I bought a 6-pack from amazon and after having consumed two I am considering just throwing out the rest. I'll never eat them unless there is no other option.Bombay Potatoes and Jaipur Vegetables are great! But the Yellow Curry Vegetables are better done without.
__label__2 Never so true!: Book is great, our son loves it. Great story and very relevant to today's issues. Berenstain Bears are always worth the money.
__label__1 Rid the world of pan & scan: Everyone has a handful of titles that they just wait and wait patiently(?) to be released on DVD. This is one of mine. Imagine my surprise to find that this release only contains the pan & scan version of the film. Hands down one of the best looking wartime films out there. The cinematography is/was breathtaking. I'm basing this on the distant memory of seeing it in the movie theatre since there has never been a letterbox version of the movie released. What a golden opportunity!! - Lost! The powers that be at Columbia decided that the old dinosaur pan & scan was the best way to release this film. Sorry to rant on like this but I think it's because the ultimate insult occurs on the back of the DVD package where there are three 1:85 still shots from the film - what a slap in the face.
__label__2 If you enjoy steak, you NEED this book!: I am, without question, a steak connoisseur and I knew quite a bit about steak to begin with, but this book is loaded with everything you could possibly need or want to know about it. Aside from the general knowledge and resources (and impressive list of top-quality steak houses) this book has tons of creative recipes for a variety of types of steak as well as side dishes and sauces.I highly recommend it!
__label__2 Friends what can I say: Friends what can I say it was absolutely the best sitcom ever you really thought of them as the friends next door,we all couldn't wait til Thursday night to see what happens next time after the show went off the air I just had to have the complete series in my collection to be able to watch any time I need a friendly fix.LOL If you missed any of the episodes you can catch up on them on your own time & never miss a beat.
__label__2 Good for stain resistance and subtle shine: Does everything it claims. Henkel products are without a doubt the best and Factory Direct is the best place to buy. Product will make floors a little slippery, be carefull rugs have rubber backing.
__label__1 Sahara's background music distracting & inappropriate: The excessive use of irrelevant 1970s music adds nothing to this interesting adventure story. At times it is nearly impossible to understand the dialogue due to the volume of the music. Most of the music (songs) chosen have absolutely nothing to do with the story and they mainly serve to ruin the experience. The book was many times more interesting.
__label__2 What a sweet testimony.: What a sweet and lovely tribute to a daughter who died too soon and certainly in a senseless way. I was a little leery to read this book, as I'm the mother of two teenage daughters. I wasn't sure what type of information or details would be included and I was pleasantly surprised by what it contained. What I found was a book written by two parents trying to make sure people didn't forget about the people involved in the Columbine tragedy, and most importantly, show that there is HOPE and PEACE in Christ! They share stories about their daughter and share stories from her journal. Rachel's faith in Christ was amazingly intimate and not one you'd expect for such someone her age.I enjoyed this book and would recommend it for teens and adults. I would hope that if I was presented with such a tragedy, I would present myself the way this family has.
__label__1 NOT AUTHENTIC: This is not accurate or complete or un-edited, bits and pieces. Not a good study tool for a student.
__label__1 Weak, almost tasteless, Coffee: Bought this based on CU's ratings. Big mistake. Most friends tell me I like weak coffee, and to me coffee made by this machine is overly weak. Taste more like hot water than coffee. And the taste is unchangeable - coffee taste the same regardless of how many scoops of coffee you put in the basket. Strange!! Not a coffee maker I can recommend.
__label__1 Works fine, the first time...: Bought this for a rafting trip for our family. Took lots of great shots, took the film out for processing (after a little trouble rewinding the roll.) Tried repeatedly to put in a new roll of 35mm film for another adventure, but after many attempts, going over & over the instructions, determined that the camera was broken. The wheel that is supposed to advance the film didn't work properly, and although the wheel would turn, the little teeth that the film is supposed to grab onto didn't move, prohibiting me from installing new film. This ended up being a single use camera, rather than an environmentally friendly, reloadable camera. Boo.
__label__2 Point system is not for everybody, but it worked for me: The hardest part of exercise is getting started. This program really helps because it makes every little bit count. You can start by doing lite exercise and move up to more strenuous workouts. If you are already in shape and exercising regularly, you can also benefit. I found the point system fun -- kind of like taking a quiz in a magazine.
__label__2 Baseball Is A Game: Someone once wrote that major league baseball is a business, but minor league baseball is still a game. For those of us who love baseball, but have soured on major league baseball, Mike Shannon's book hits it on the nose. His romp through the Frontier League is an entertaining and informative narrative on the players and people involved in the lower minor leagues. They truly love the game of baseball and you will love this book!
__label__2 Parts manunuel!!!: Looks like it will work for me. Just got it this pm so not much time to look @ it yet, but looks good and came timely also !!!Thanks, Sean
__label__2 Es un libro basico: Este es uno de los libros basicos para los mastozoologos marinos, ya que se hace una revision sobre la evolucion de los mamiferos marinos.
__label__1 broke twice and can't get replacement parts: don't waste your money on this blender. I have had it a couple of years and it broke two times. First the blade broke. Kitchenaid no longer made the blade so we had to spend $35.00 on a whole new jar assembly. Than about a year later the black coupler with the 6 little teeth that spin the blades began to break off until they were all completely gone. now we are left with a bottom unit that works but can not spin the blades and a new jar assembly that we wasted money on.. Ok so we call Kitchenaid again and they do not make this part either!! Also we were told you need to buy a special tool to fix the blender and what do you know? they don't sell that either!!!! I think this blender has some serious design flaws and would strongly advise people to think hard before you waste any money on this blender!! We will be buying a new Wering blender!!!
__label__1 If you have no experience at all: with Cisco products then by all means purchase the software to assist you with your preparation for the exams. So far, I have only taken (and passed) the switching exam, and I am quite disappointed with the lab. There was a lot missing - ATM,FDDI,Troubleshooting MLS, and the worst was the lack of commands for the router when configuring Inter-VLAN routing. But, like I said before, if you have no "real" experience with switches and the like, this is the product to get you there.
__label__1 The literary equivalent of Cinemax after hours: Think early Bret Easton Ellis channeling Shannon Tweed. Then move on.
__label__1 Very Disappointing Read: I have always enjoyed Laurell K Hamilton's stories, but this one was awful. I will hesitate to buy any Anita Blake stories in the future. For those of you who haven't read the book, let me summarize the entire story so you can save yourself some money. Anita has sex, debates who she'll have sex with, plans to have sex, and anguishes over abstaining from sex for five minutes. That's the entire book. When are we going to get back to Anita Blake actually doing something other than her boyfriends?
__label__2 One of the best sounding, and best ideas for a compilation: This is not a lame Cleopatra Records collection thrown together hastily for a quick cash in. This collection compiles Stone's cover tracks spanning five different decades by some of the biggest names in music at the heights of their career. To be fair, a small amount of lesser acts contribute too.David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Aretha Frankin, Linda Ronstadt, Grand Funk Railroad, and the Ramones are just a few of the heavyweights involved. Most tracks are reworked here and there to most suit the artist, but there's no denying it's a Stones classic they are covering. One of the best sounding, and best ideas for a compilation I've ever come across.
__label__2 For die hard baseball lovers only: I found this book quite interesting, the subject is well documented and the facts are clear and understandable. The roots of baseball are many, and Block did a fine job of exploring all of them. I did enjoy the many drawings and manuscripts enclosed.If you really are a student of the game and it's roots, this is a book you cannot ignore.
__label__2 Love Candex!: Received this product, and all things I order from Amazon, in very timely fashion. Candex simply works in my system. I live with a high level of yeast, which causes all kinds of troubles, and Candex is the only item that I have found that destroys the cell walls of the yeast so the yeast killers I take can do their job and I can flush the yeast from my system. I don't think I will ever get rid of the yeast completely, but Candex has made my life SO much nicer. The price from Amazon is the big reason I purchase this item, and many others from Amazon. Thank You Amazon!!!!
__label__2 Nice intro to Window 98 programming: Introduction to Windows 98 programming is a good book for beginners. The good thing about it is that it concentrates on the true basics of Windows; that is the Win32. The authors progressively bring the reader throught the concept of Windows Programming and handling the basic resources. The only mention of MFC is in the last Chapter - this is good because MFC can be tough on the beginner. This book is good for the beginner.
__label__2 Classic: I saw this movie a long time ago had to get it for christmas for my mother I knew she would love to have and be able to watch this movie again :)
__label__2 Great product: Easy to use and keeps the water in the waterbed from getting yucky (technical term - lol).Product was shipped quickly
__label__1 Awful: Zipper was sewn on wrong. Couldn't open the bag. Wasn't worth making the return so I just tossed it. Find another option.
__label__1 "B" movie script sold as a novel: This book is a painful read. I couldn't even finish it. The author lists several scripts to his credit, and this must have been one no one would buy. The narrative is very stilted, the characters are one dimensional and their "lines" are so lame as to be funny. This story reads like something the Sci-Fi channel might have produced in their early years before they had money and viewers. Even the book font is blocky and clunky - just like the story!
__label__1 Let those who ride decide!: This book should be scorned and avoided! Accident avoidance not helmets save lives! Buy a book about improving your riding skills instead!
__label__2 Monkey Dance on Wiggles Yummy Yummy: I would just like to tell everyone who is bashing this video because The Monkey Dance is not on here that they are watching the wrong video. The Monkey Dance is on Wiggles - Yummy Yummy. As for this one, it is great. My 2 1/2 year old can not get enough of either of the videos. They are a must for young children.
__label__2 Little bear: Very entertaining and educational. My nearly 3 year old enjoyed it thoroughly. Highly recommended.
__label__2 Great DVD Set: This set is complete and tells you everything a real Beatles fan would want to know about the Beatles. It goes through the entire history, guided by Paul, Ringo, George Martin, and others, and has many interesting storys on the way. The footage that is also on these Dvds is phenomenal!
__label__1 Se 8 3/4" Professional leather punch S.S.: The punch, at first glance appeared to be well constructed. However on further inspection, it was noted that the punches did not line up perpendicular to the anvil. This made it virtually impossible to punch a clean hole. On punch did not appear to be sharpened and I could only make an impression in the leather with it. I later purchased a "General" rotary head punch which worked quite well. I would seem that a more careful set-up during the machining and sharpening process would make this an excellent leather punch
__label__2 A CD you can listen to over and over...: I'd never heard of James Tipper until I heard about this CD on a newsgroup. I rarely buy CD's based on one song but I did this time and was very suprised. It has lots of different styles and moods so you don't get tired of one vibe like you do with alot of CD's. There's something for everyone. I like the techno sounding stuff like Bioluminescence and Evolve and the title track and my wife likes the ballads that are done mostly with piano. Lyrics are great and there are clever production touches. Overall, money well spent.
__label__1 Not as strong as it seems: At first I thought that this was a great product, I've had other kingston's in the past and this continued the trend. I'm not a fan of Sandisk so I thought I'd give another retractable a try, especially since this one has such high reviews.Worked great for about 3 weeks, but then it started to slow down on transfer rates, not impressive in the first place. I'm rough on electronics, and unfortunately the plastic didn't hold up. On campus, people bump into computers all the time and one time was enough to break the plastic on this. It only worked for one day after that and is now useless.So over-all I can't say I'm impressed.
__label__2 Not as sticky as I'd thought, but good fun nonetheless: The tattoos are quite cute, and I had no trouble with alignment in my printer; however, they aren't quite as sticky as I'd thought they'd be. The top and bottom flaps, in particular, seemed likely to pull back.The tattoos are pretty easy to create -- I used the online tool (search for tattoo on their site) to upload one of my photos, rotate and crop it, then create a .pdf file to print.FWIW: I currently use the tattoos with a clear iPod case and that solves the peeling edges issue nicely.
__label__1 Only for certain applications: This will indeed ruin drywall and pull off paint, particularly if the previous paint job was done over dusty drywall. It is great for taping woodwork,however.3M makes a Safe Release tape for Delicate Surfaces. That is THE One to use on painted drywall surfaces.
__label__2 A little better than the first one: The first of this Moonlight Bay Trilogy, Fear of Flying, was excellent. This one is a little better. I liked the way Mr. Koontz portrayed Bobby Holloway, Chris' best friend. He got more part than the first book, eventhough I kinda missed Orson, the dog, since in this book he was kidnapped. I finished this in two days -- would be one if I'm not jammed with uni stuffs -- and I can't wait for the conclusion. Hope Mr. Koontz will hurry up....
__label__1 Ridiculous!: $19.99 for a replacement head when a whole new brush costs $21.99? Do yourself a favor - go to Oxo's web site where you can buy one for $4.99.
__label__1 Only Paleo in Name: I've never tried these so they may taste fantastic, however, looking over the ingredients shows that these are in no way Paleo. If you are truly living, or trying to live, a Paleo lifestyle move on. Look at the ingredients below:Ingredients: Coating (Maltitol, Cocoa Butter, Nonfat Milk Powder, Whole Milk Powder, Lecithin (An Emulsifier), Natural Vanilla), Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Rice Protein Concentrate, Whey Crisps (Whey Protein Isolate, Rice Flour)), Maltitol Syrup, Almond Butter, Glycerine, Dry Roasted Almonds, Digestion Resistant Fiber (Fibersol 2), Coconut Oil, Fructooligosaccharides, Lecithin, Natural Flavor, Omega 3 Concentrate Complex, Xylitol, Covalent Bonded Glutamine (GlutImmune(tm)), Sea Salt, Green Tea, Elderberry, Rosemary Extract.3/4's of the items listed don't belong on the Paleo diet.
__label__1 Black bar on the page: This cartridge printed a black bar on the right side of each page. it was more than a streak, it was solid and about a third of an inch wide. Returning it was easy enough, though.
__label__1 Quality: This is just it...Why spend time on a single, when you got more and better on their album "Tyranny For You".Is it worth the effort to stick in a single for 10 minutes of fun? Stick to the longplaying."Tyranny for you" is a great Allboom
__label__2 Big enough for a dad: The other reviews I read about this bag made me hesitate to buy it because a lot of them said the bag was not big enough. But I went ahead and got one anyway and honestly, if the bag were any bigger - it would not comfortably fit on a grown human being. The style of the bag (as a messenger bag cut) would not work. It would be too bulky.It may not have all the space that a super-huge diaper bag may have but it's got enough space for what you'll need. And most men I know only carry their wallet, cell phone, and keys with them. All that fits in here with the baby stuff. For a woman, a lot of us have lots more in our purses that must be combined with the baby stuff in the diaper bag (hence the need for a larger bag) - unless you plan on carrying two bags and baby.This bag is perfect for dads.
__label__1 No Control over Steam Settings, Gunky Water Tank: While the water in this steamer heats up very quickly, there is no control over the steam settings. Be careful and don't leave this appliance unattended as the water will soon boil off. While initially the quick heating seemed to be a big plus, I realized that the lack of control settings (i.e. high, medium, low) was a minus. An even bigger minus was the fact that the way the water tank is designed (a plastic tab inside the tank obstructs ventilation), it never dries out completely. Also after one use, there was some sort of gunky white stuff on the bottom of the water tank. Tried the vinegar rinse, but the gunky stuff remained. In short, this appliance lacks control settings and it needs a redesign to allow for better drying between uses.
__label__1 What's Love Got To Do With It?: This isn't a sugary sweet little love story and don't let anyone tell you it is. This is a book about sex, pure and simple. I mean, come on, folks, what the heck else could he want with her? Ya know? The mistake the author makes is trying to tie the whole little lusty affair up into a saccharin sweet doughnut of love and roses. If you believe this is love then put your tooth under your pillow and dream of the tooth fairy. I could have stomached this book had the author just given us the explicit details of the sex relationship rather than waxing long and laboriously about every stupid thing under the sun. I mean, if I want descriptions of covered bridges and all, I'll just buy a picture book. Oh well, back to Crush. At least there I'll find some much needed details.
__label__1 Watch broke and service took WAAAAY too long....: My son was so happy to get a new Timex watch and then after about 3 weeks the Indiglo feature stopped working. I sent it back to Timex who, after a month, sent a replacement back to us. However, the replacement was the wrong version of the watch (analog vs. digital). I called and they said they would ship me a postage paid box to return the wrong watch and then they would order and send the new (correct) one. It has been another month again and I have gotten the box for the return but no new watch. I called again today and they said it would be 4 more weeks due to "inventory" that they have to conduct at the end of the year. Very dissappointed since I always thought of Timex as a reliable company. I will likely not buy their product again since their service has been less than stellar and the watch broke after 3 weeks.
__label__1 Anyone ever considered that Ann's not for real?: I mean, seriously: She basically is a caricature. Her looks, her books (short, repetitive, not really, ahm, researched), her life (she's living in Manhattan, for heaven's sake! why not in San Fran?!). Maybe it's all just satire. What if she writes a book in a few years: "My Life as a Conservative Barbie Doll"...?Come on, you can't say you haven't thought about that, can you?
__label__2 I have waited *SO* long for this...: Seated next to the sound board, in San Diego, for the 1989 tour of Tommy, I bought the VHS of the Universal Studio show the instant it came out. Although I missed the 96/96 tour of Quadrophenia, I did see the original band perform the music live on the U.S. tour of that album's release. I have been looking for a DVD copy of the Tommy performance for years now, and to see a set with Quadrophenia included is to have too many wishes come true! If you have any interest in seeing The Who captured Live in the best of settings; having *way* too much fun, you absolutely must get this set!
__label__1 Typical of the Series: One of the problems with Enterprise is the accusation it ignores establised canon. The premise of this story: if Vulcans kill does it betray the teachings of Surak has already been addressed in The Original Series by Spock.
__label__1 Didn't clean my platen: The platen had been screwed up years ago by someone trying to shrink wrap without release paper. It cleaned up somewhat but not enough to satisfy me. It might work well for others.
__label__1 Several problems with this crib: Although it was very easy to assemble and reasonably priced, I am not very happy that we bought this crib. First, we wanted to put bumpers around the crib, so we had to line the "headboard" side with velcro. That worked out fairly well, except that when our baby was too old for bumpers, we ended up peeling off the paint along with the velcro. Secondly, most mobiles don't fit very well on this crib. Our mobile just didn't look very sturdy on it, so we took it down, even though I think our baby would have loved it. It's attractive, but the bumper and mobile problems were annoying.
__label__1 Very poor performance.: I had to replace my Linksys router after a surge blew it up (Despite a very good quality surge protector).I was attracted by the idea of the dual band and therefore more reliable connection. In fact, this router is anything but reliable. The range is very poor and the maximum connection speed I have ever had is 11mbps. I have had occaisions where I was literally sitting in the same room as the router and been unable to get a signal.Tech support was polite but not at all helpful. I found that they were reading to me from some source.I even eventually bought the companion Belkin card for my laptop. Didn't make any difference that I could tell.Sent it back, bought another Linksys router and life has been good
__label__2 Really comfortable: Received the merchandise quickly. Brand new and in the box. The shoes are made well and very comfortable. I have bought Palladium shoes before and very pleased with the product. Very happy with the purchase.
__label__1 Is suggested as a case for the Sony Handycam - doesnt work: When I purchased the Sony Handycam Amazon suggested this case for it. It does not even fit the camcorder. Just watch what accesories they suggest you buy.
__label__1 Heavy Time is a must-miss: I just finished reading it. I don't understand why anyone would recommend it. 3/4 of it is repetative fluff. This could have been an average short story with proper editing. Absolutely nothing happens in the middle of the book. Read the first 20, and the last 20, and you have read it all.I'll stick with Asimov, Heinlein, Drake, Weber, etc for sci-fi...
__label__2 I Spy Junior: The activities in this software are exciting and fun for a child as young as 2 1/2 years old. Children choose from 6 types of activities that hold their interest. The objects move when they are selected and the animation is life-like and fun to watch. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for your child's first software program.
__label__2 Ducky Tub: My son had one of these. I wanted one for my niece, 17 months old and afraid of the "big" tub. I couldn't find one locally, so ordered from here. My little tub arrived in about 4 days and my niece LOVES IT!!! No longer a fight to get her in the bath, just out.
__label__1 Most horrible band ever: Grim Reaper is the absolute worst band without a shadow of a doubt ever! These guys absolutely ...(stinks). Worst of all is their singer with his nadless screaming and you cant forget the cheesy lyrics. My friends and I unanimously agreed that Grim Reaper is the worst band ever (worse than Stryper, Danger Danger, and the Bullet Boys!) On my birthday i recieved this pathetic excuse for music as a gag gift from my friends. Beavis and Butthead were right......I would give this negative stars if possible.
__label__1 Poor Quality product: Within use of few days I noticed a leak. I believe it was because of the water pressure it started leaking. I ended up buying heavy-duty hose.
__label__2 part for pool: good, worked well for the reason it was designed and ordered. It was the one recommended by the pool manufacturer
__label__2 touching: I thought the movie unfolded beautifully in a not such a beautiful reality it depicts. I especially liked Demi Moor and think she did a pretty good job playing Lola's Mom. The parallel drawn between 4 generations of women is apparent and fun to watch.
__label__2 The Beginning: I have been listening to the music of Christian Vander for many years now, and it is difficult to remember back to how and when I was first really exposed to his life vivifying music. But I do know that this was the first album of his work that I ever owned.And what an album it is! This is the very first album of Vander's most well known band Magma and it remains to this day an incredible and powerful listening experience. There are other Magma CD's (and indeed, other Vander related projects) which move me even more than this one does, but this one will always hold a special place with me due to the fact that it is the first I owned and the real birth of Vander's exhaustive and wonderful musical output.For the uninitiated who are truly seeking a rigorous and wonderful musical listening adventure, I do recommend starting here and then continuing on through Vander's incredible body of work.
__label__1 oops: My wife wrote this in a fit of insomnia at 4:30 in the morning and accidentally posted it under my name. Not too bright, that woman.
__label__1 An Irish Folktale that should not have been retold!: I read this book before reading it to my little one and I am glad I did. Not only does it not have a positive message, it is a story of rewarded laziness and greed. And the message is not subtle either, it is all out there in the first line .."Jamie O'Rourke was the laziest man in all of Ireland." -- and he was still so at the end of the book -- and proud of it! The only decent aspect of the book are the illustrations which are very nice, but alas not enough to risk sending a totally wrong message to our children.
__label__2 Ancient treasure.: I love this game. Fast, smooth 3D polygon graphics on the Genesis, with responsive, easy digital gamepad controls. The cartridge is as cheap as a cough drop and the ROM plays perfectly on the GP2X if you want to take it on the road.
__label__2 In time and good condition: This book was a gift to my son in Amsterdam. It arrived in time and was in good condition. I am sure that he will enjoy reading it as I did!
__label__2 An A+ Movie!!!: Phenomenal movie! An absolute must-see! Fantastic actors, well written script, and well directed. Keep the tissues nearby when you watch this one!
__label__1 meh: Just not very good. Cool intro and premise but epic fail after about 15 minutes. Good actor selection, nice opening script but just bad after that. Who's the target audience?
__label__1 Good Ideas That Don't Work: I received this book as a gift. I can see why it was chosen: there are nice photographs and many interesting cookie recipes. I really could not wait to try them out. Unfortunately, a few recipes I tried did not work. The Valentine Sandwich Cookie recipe yieled a mousse-like batter that just melted in the oven and the Checkerboard Squares batter seemed to be going the same way. I added some flour to help them, but no amount of doctoring could save them. The Spritz cookies worked out really well. But it is hard to tell which recipes will work out.
__label__1 You better be an expert in VB if you want to understand this: On the back of the book is a diagram showing each book in the Wrox series written to build your 'Visual Basic career'. Each book represents a logical next step as you move from beginner to intermediate to advanced. According to the diagram, this book is supposed to be the very first book a wanna-be programmer should read. You've got to be kidding me. This book is much more complicated than the next level book, Peter Wright's beginning Visual Basic, yet that book is ranked ahead of this one. The programs are well explained, but even these explanations make it difficult to understand what is truly going on because they expect you to have a pretty advanced knowledge of VB in the first place. If you're a good VB programmer, buy this book. If not, get Peter Wright's book first, then go back to this one.
__label__1 Boring and mostly unimaginative: The early entries in the book (first 100 pages) are very interesting tales of unconventional lives revealing the author's confusion with his/her ethnicity. However, after ten or so entries, the reading becomes old and repitive revealing many Americans need to preach their problems. Being biracial/multicultural is not a problem but a gift which I can personally attest. The readings need more creativity in establishing a point that is engaging but captivating. Its too easy to simply say back when I was 4 I came to the realization that... and over and over again. With this book all I can say is find the entry which most relates to your personal history because this book proves that the whole is not greater than the sum, of a portion mind you,of its parts.
__label__2 Teenagers Love These: Note that there are only 3 episodes on this DVD. I thought there were five but that's my fault. My teenage grandsons eat this stuff up and just LOVE these stories.
__label__1 When Clooney is confused we are confused: I strongly sense the confusion in this film is not deliberate, but rather due to poor editing and a jumbled script. There is way too much going on in this film and more is not necessarily better. About a half dozen storylines should have been stripped out of this film, since they become loose strings in the end. Really, only three storylines matter here and not one of them is the storyline that follows Clooney's character. Whatever statement this movie was trying to make is simply lost in all the clutter. If this jumble of storylines was deliberate, then it was a nice attempt but ultimately a failure. If it wasn't, well, find a better film editor.
__label__1 Limit the Number of Installs = More Hassle for the Customer: I had pre-ordered Spore, but canceled it when I heard about the SecuRom DRM on the game. The three game activation limit seems more aimed at killing the used game market rather then preventing piracy. Luckily, there are several other new games on the market now and I'm not too broken up about it.Here's hoping that EA realizes the problem and changes the DRM setup so that it doesn't limit activations.
__label__2 You Know He Had To Have Been Working Day And Night: You know Tupac had to have been working day and night when he was alive, since he died he had quite a few albums with previously unreleased material come out, plus all the music he made when he was alive.I think this CD is pretty good, the best songs are Pac's Life, Sleep, and Untouchable Ft. Yaki Kadafi, Hussein Fatal, and Gravy.I know there was another version of Untouchable he did with Left Eye from TLC. Too bad that version's not here.
__label__2 good seat, but...: my 11 week old has enjoyed this seat. it is comfortable and he liked it from week 2. it's been good for us, too - it's often the only way my husband and i could eat dinner or grab a shower. however, now that he is older i want something a little more stimulating. this gives him nothing to do or to look at. based on other reviews, i am going out today to get the kick and play boucer.
__label__2 Superior: "Cornford arrived at a picture of the origins of Greek philosophy which was historically superior to that which anyone else has so far reached." -The Classical Review (on back of 1957 edition). I strongly agree.
__label__1 Could be better: This video was made about 10 years ago. The models do not appear to be enthusiasts of either Tai Chi or Yoga, as none of the models seem to be instructor quality. All the instruction is provided in VO. The instructions do not give a complete routine or even provide transition for most of the moves.Gets a 0 for instructional qualityGets a 1 for production valueGets a 1 for quality of intstructors/modelsGets a 1 for camera workGets a 4 for the concept.With the popularity of these exercise methods growing, increased popularity in nude yoga specifically, I would think there is a great market for this video to be remade and remade properly.
__label__2 A kick ... cd: Well I went to a Guttermouth concert and this band was playing called Authority Zero. The band put on a wonderful live show from great moshing music to irish dance to the fastest punk rock singer i've heard in concert. The cd only makes this band even better. A great live show and a excellent compilation of sounds on their cd.
__label__1 Disappointed: I've just reached the chapter where he tells me I have to read the book again. I believe everything he says (except why I started) but the constant attacks have actually got me smoking MORE and have me terrified of trying to quit! He could have reduced the book to a few words. You are a drug addict. Stop feeding your addiction. Plus a few more words on how filthy, unhealthy, expensive and pathetic smoking is. But I already know all that.
__label__2 Classic Syleena. Needs improvement: on Syleena's webiste, You can hear a more explicit version of the song. That version is not on the cd. That version should be released.
__label__1 Rancid: I ordered 3 boxes of Jammie Dodgers (over$24) as Christmas gifts on Dec. 2, 11. They were not opened until Xmas and a week or two later. They were spoiled. They smelled off and tasted awful. The best by dates were covered up. They seemed like they were over a year old. I will never order anything from them again!
__label__2 5 stars all the way: I was pleasantly surprised when I watched this movie. It is amazing! I have watched it several times already.
__label__2 surprising: Plenty of battery life with rechargeables. I have had no problems with batteries. Great features and specs for the price. The most surprising is how nice photos with flash look. Even up close results are soft and highlights are not blocked up and washed out. The large viewing area is helpful for eyes which are not as good as they used to be. I would like a viwfinder option, though. This camera doesn't have one.
__label__2 good to deal with: I got the item in a timely manner and it came as advertised. All in all, pretty happy. It had a little more wear than I expected but it plays well and that's what matters!
__label__1 Not Too Helpful: I was a little disappointed with this book. When I bought it I thought it would be more of a collection of spells and charms. The most useful part of the book were a number of quick cure type charms which would only be helpful to a novice. Most of which, I now use other spells in place of. Many facts I even found false, and others were only half truths. Frankly, I learned more about true magick from talking to friends than from this book. It was only good for an entertaining read.
__label__2 Excellent book for Christian parents: I guess I'm not surprised at how extremely polarized the reviews of this book are on this site. We are becoming a more and more polarized society (just look at how close the last presidential election was!) and it's going to come down to whether you will follow the teachings of the world (which immediately condemns any thought or idea that does not agree with it as "intolerant" and "hateful") or the teachings of God.For those who follow the teachings of God, this book will guide you through a loving, biblical approach to parenting boys. I found it extremely helpful.
__label__1 Not worth money: Cheaply made, dog had it destroyed in few hours. Have to watch so dog doesn't choke on rubber pieces. Never buying from this company again.
__label__1 True decadence: Shorter Ayn Rand: A combination of greed and cruelty will get you more power, sex and money than either greed or cruelty alone.It's a crummy novel, too. When I was in college, long ago, the architecture students used to arrange a showing of the movie version once a year, at which they would jeer and hoot and holler not unlike the way a later generation behaved at 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show.'
__label__1 Save your money.: The thing arrived promptly but is pretty much useless. I can pick up more hair by sliding my foot on the carpet.
__label__2 A fabulous book.: This is one of the first books that I really couldn't put down. It was easy to read and had me spellbound from the moment I started reading. It tugged at the heart strings and brought a tear to my eye in some parts. Eventhough it was set in 1952 in may ways it could still happen today. A story I won't soon forget.
__label__1 DON'T DON'T DON'T ! !: The DVD that I ordered came from Brazil, and when I played it, it was very bad.DVD has terrible picture and sound. If I had known the condition that the footage was going to be, I would have never ordered it. Even though I love Fleetwood Mac. A waste!
__label__2 bobby beats frank: Having grown up with Bobby Darin on the radio and big screen I knew he was good, but I had forgotten how good until I listened to this 4 set album. The set starts with his pop hits, moves into his ballad /Vegas years and ends on the 4th cd with his final change into his protest style Dylan-esk stage. His ability to slip into these three styles from pop,to lounge singer, to country is remarkable. He is so comfortable in all arenas of music that you will be amazed how utterly smooth he is. His best? "A Nightingale sang..." is a man at the top of his form. He out Franks Frank in the best lounge singer tradition. Smooth as polished steel. My wife found his ballards romantic and my teenage son was replaying several songs. The enclosed book is most informative,filled with stories of his tragic relationships and personality flaws,his triumphs, why he was so driven, pictures and recording histories. This man could sing. This man could sing. Buy it.
__label__1 TRAGIC WASTE OF TALENT: I am a huge Ashley Judd fan and this movie is a tragic waste of her beauty and talent. It's just horrible.
__label__1 Review - amazon Purchase: I ordered the book on February 19 and it was supposed to be delivered by March 5. The company did not sent it out in time so the money was refunded and the book was to be sent anyway. Well it is March 12 and still no book. I start my class today with no book and have to go and buy a new one from the book store at the college. I am very upset about this as the book new is $134.00. Not sure I would purchase from this company again. The book said it was in transit, but it has been that way since March 5. Sorry to have to write a bad review, but this was not good as I have no book to start my class with. Lisa

__label__1 Total waste money!: This DVD totally wasted my money. It contains only a few things that have relation with The Rock. Other things are view points of The Rock from some people that The Rock don't even knew them, and the picture quality is really bad, and contains notthing, I totally regreted to bought this DVD, if you bought this DVD, you will feel the same way that I feel. Trust Me!! I still cannot believe that The Rock could let them make this DVD for him...
__label__1 Fifty Cent's "Get Rich or Die Tryin": This album is crap. There was only one good song on the whole album. Don't waste your money on this album like I did. Just buy the single of "P.I.M.P."
__label__2 Best of the Ice Age movies: Thought this one of the Ice Age movies, loved the squirrel, going to rent it again when my grandchildren come to visit me, they too will love it. Thank you
__label__2 Liberace:The True Story: This book is a Great Read! It starts right from the beginning and goes right until his final days. He really was a great entertainer! Nobody could play the piano like Liberace!
__label__2 Very good movie.: Very good except you can imagine from the beginning what characters are likely not going to make it. If you like these movies and you are a patriotic American you will enjoy this and if you don't already, you'll probably be more willing to thank a service member or Veteran on the street.
__label__1 The worst Ravenloft book in the series...: I've read the majority of this series and this one is by far the worst. It's painfully obvious that Laurell K. Hamilton has never played D&D and has little to no idea how Ravenloft has been portrayed by her fellow authors. The first Ravenloft book that I read concerning Harkon Lukas was "Heart of Midnight," which was excellent. In that book, Lukas was suave, sophisticated and subtle in his evil. Here, he's just plain bloodthirty and cruel, not at all how I pictured him after reading HOM. Maybe LKH is a decent author. I don't know, since this is the only novel of hers I've ever read. All I know is that she has no clue how to write for D&D.
__label__1 Worst choice - useless: I bought couple of these and for both I noticed they quickly deteriorated after couple of weeks. The lamplight became dim and I was wondering if I am slowly getting blind. I examined the bulbs and noticed the tube tarnished inside by a mirror-black residue - presumable film from metal evaporation, because it was not there when I bought them. When you turn the light on, it takes couple of seconds to light up, when turned off - it continues glowing for up to five seconds. This is not how halogen bulbs should be!I replaced the Feit bulb with another brand and guess what? The non-Feit 150W bulb is BRIGHTER than the Feit 300W!Do not buy Feit halogen bulbs.
__label__2 real history: This book opens the door to a part of american history that has little written about it. it read quickly. now i am destined to travel to the sites mentioned in the book. glad i found it.Steve GlazerMA. History
__label__2 EXCELLENT Text BOOK!: I really like the way that this book is written. The material is clearly written and easy to follow. Also, the chapter lay-out works well nicely!
__label__2 The mike works well: The microphone is convenient (hands free and you are not wired to your desk) and the sound quality is good according to the people I talk to.One problem I have and I don't know if it is the mike or my Mac: sometimes the light stops working. If I reboot or unplug/replug the USB cable it starts working again. Even if the light isn't on, the mike still works when the button has been pressed. It is just harder to tell that it is depressed.
__label__2 Loved these...: I tried to wear my regular Spanx for awhile, but they became too constricting. These are really comfy and do the trick.
__label__2 Garmin Streetpilot 340 Portable GPS: We love it! We recently moved to a town in the mountains with no street numbers or names! I can always find where I want to go, even if I have to go North, South and East before I can go west!
__label__1 Bored And Bored AGAIN!!: SCEAM AND SCREAM again was something I saw a lot as a child and I never understood what was going on but I watched it anyone because it was VINCENT PRICE and it seemed to be a horror film. Well I watched it recently and on this very disc and still could not be able to tell you what the sub-plots in the movie are about. I could give you a vague guess and then tell you most of the movie is about a crazy scientist who is making super beings who live on blood. But it is SO BORING!! I don't know how I watched it so many times as a child. THE OBLONG BOX is my least favorite VINCENT PRICE movie so I cannot reccommend this under any circumstances when I refuse to own it myself. I immediately sold it after I watched it because I was so mortified by it's total lack of entertainment value.
__label__2 It was way better than I thought....: When I read the book, "Daddy's little girl" I was surprised because I thought it's going to be not good.Trust me readers, this Mary's best book so far since "All through the night"
__label__1 Casino: I am really shocked that someone can sell this "quality" dvd. The story is okay, if you can see it, as it jumps and is not sharp in any way, you can't see the titles half of the time, it says you can switch them of, but you can't. It looks like they download it from Internet together with fansubs and burn it on dvd. It is really pitty, as Simon Yam is great as usual and the movie as such too. Shame on the company!
__label__2 Really fast shipping!: They said shipping time was two months and I received my first issue two weeks after I placed my order. I am so pleased with this order!
__label__2 Very pleased: I ordered this product and it arrived very quickly. I've been using for about a month now and haven't had any problems. I use it mainly to transfer data from one computer to another. The only problem I had with it was one time it would not disconnect from my laptop, but it was a problem with Vista and not the unit itself. Overall, I'm very, very pleased with it.
__label__2 You Will Not Be Disappointed: Nikolaj Arcel did a remarkable job with the screen play adaptation. Noomi Rapace is a little tall for the role but does an excellent job with the character of Lisbeth. Unfortunately, the complex character of Erika Berger is not fully developed. Some reviewers have written that only Swedish language with English subtitles was available. The version I received has an option of English dubbing or Swedish language with English subtitles. Perhaps these options were not available in earlier editions.
__label__1 Truly a disappointment: I've been a diehard Foo fan for years, purchasing everything I can get my hands on that is associated with them. Granted this DVD biography is not officially licensed, it is not nearly worth the money. You learn the bare facts about the band, but you could just get online and learn just as much. If you're in the market for a Foo DVD, please use your money on the fantastic live DVD Everywhere But Home.
__label__1 Why so expensive?: I have been a big fan of "House, MD" for many years now, and I am just starting to collect the seasons on DVD. Out of curiosity, I checked out what it might cost to purchase digital copies of the full seasons online. WOW!!!! Is there any reason why it is so much more expensive? I purchased Season One for $19.99 at a local big-box store. They carry all of the show's past seasons, and almost all of them are $19.99, but no more than $29.99 apiece. So my question is, why does it cost $37.99 to purchase a digital copy from Amazon? That just seems like a rip-off to me...
__label__2 fan from the start: Being from Minnesota and having traveled all across the state to see him perform, I have adored Jonny Lang for years. For those slamming Smokin', do you realize he hadn't even been playing for a year when he recorded this album. I'd like to see you learn the guitar (at 14), record an album, and book sold out shows across your state all within one year. Sure he's no SRV - give him 20 more years then you can compare.
__label__1 DON"T BUY THIS BOTTLE: I bought this as a perfume bottle for myself. It was such an ugly piece of junk when I got it. It looked like something I would have got at the dollar store. The glass was very poor and flawed. The etching on it was very poor as well. I was so disapointed.
__label__2 Great film to see: This film was very good and the actors took the story to another level. It was great to go on this journey with these characters and the film was entertaining!! I definitely recommend seeing the film and its well worth your money. Two thumbs up
__label__2 For the Garand Man: Every M1owner should have a copy! It's the Bible for the M1 Garand ! Get a copy while you can,not always easy to find.
__label__2 absolutely fabulous!: This is a great series. Very smart and entertaining. I don't think I've ever been so addicted to any series.
__label__1 good for laughs,but not scary: This movie was a joke.It was also inconsistent with the other Psycho movies.First of all ,Mrs.Bates was really Norman's aunt(if you saw Psycho 2)And also Mrs.Bates and her lover were found in bed(Psycho 1) but here they were found in the basement.And Norman was supposed to have killed them when he was 12 years old (psycho 2)but in Psycho 4 he killed them when he was 15..Those are just a few examples.They took a good movie(The original Psycho) and made a joke out of it by creating this satirical film.It was not scary at all,just ridiculous.
__label__1 Not a Women's Watch: The watch is an attractive watch FOR MEN. It is enormous on a women's wrist and in fact does not even properly bend around the wrist to fit. Amazon should not have this listed under women's watches.
__label__1 too small: no enough room for anything the clip keeps pupping open very unsatisfactory for the cost of the product extremely over priced
__label__2 FINALLY: i been waiting 4 this release for years and now the wait is OVER i bought both versions the blu ray and the dvd gd quality 4 the blu ray i recommend the blu ray plus both versions include special features and the making of godzilla vs biollante i just bought the dvd so it will fit in with my other godzilla dvds and it fits in pretty well xD now all i need is destroy all monsters and a OFFICIAL USA release of the return of godzilla aka godzilla 1985 even though my bootleg copy has amazing quality so guys buy this on blu ray better quality and buy the dvd version so it can fit in with ur other godzilla dvds xD.
__label__1 too many mistakes: I certainly have nothing against this story and Jennie Shortridge's style is fine. It won't win any prizes but it was an easy, enjoyable read.I could give it only one star because the edition I read (paperback) was full of typos, double commas, hyphens in the middle of a word and simple spelling mistakes.(bom instead of born???) Where were her proof readers and her editors? At one point I started marking the mistakes and found that there were at least 2 per page. I'm sorry- but this is not professional and gives the author an (undeserved?)bad name.
__label__1 DO NOT BUY THIS DANGEROUS GAME!: I beta tested this game back in March, and it caused me to have violent, uncontrollable outbursts, which continued to happen after I stopped playing the game. I lose control of myself during these "blackouts" and have no memory of the violence I've committed, just what people tell me afterwards. Several other beta testers have been affected this way as well.Since then Sega and Visual Concepts, the companies behind it, have been lying about the dangers of this game and trying to cover up the truth. In a recent memo from Sega, they claim that the occurrence of this "undesirable effect" in 0.5% of the people who play this game is an "acceptable risk."I don't know about you, but I find the risk unacceptable. To read the full story of my ordeal with this greedy corporation, and to see more evidence of their deceit, visit ...... -- and don't support these liars by buying their game!
__label__1 Very poorly written: This is probably the worst written book, I've read in years. The historical aspects are as thin as an onion peel.The character development is non-existent. The plot lines are totally ridiculous. I love Italy and thought it would be an amusing read on a recent airplane trip -- I should have taken a nap!
__label__1 Tired of Racisim in Pop Culture: While viewing this film I could not help but be offended by the way the character of the family babysitter was written. They wrote the character to be a black female who wanders around with a stupid expression making stupid choices while being the one who hammers out the profanity and the one liners as comic relief. Why do movie producers feel this kind of depiction of blacks in film is okay? There are quite a few scenes in this movie that are so sterotypical it is almost sick, namely one towards the end of the movie where the babysitter is "saving the day" by messing around with dials in the control room of the house and if one listens carefully, the sounds she makes with the dials are that of a rap groove. Really offensive!! This is a really bad example of how shallow those in coorporate seats have become to racisim in our pop culture. I thought we had moved past this mindset years ago.
__label__1 Didn't Like It: Well, I was bored. I couldn't connect with the characters, I found it hard to finish. I didn't finish this book with good feelings for the characters like I usually do with a romance book. I found Brandon's temper disturbing, he is very mean and cruel to Heather, reminded me of an abusive relationship I was in. I don't think the rape scene was necessary, it was to violent. I wouldn't recommend anyone who hasn't read this story, to bother. I hope this isn't a sign of things to come from Kathleen Woodiwiss. I actually wondered while reading this story if it was even written by her! Seriously! This story did evoke some emotions......but unfortunetly none of them were good.

__label__1 Amazing Book, DON'T BUY KINDLE VERSION: I am a scholar of gender and religious history (currently completing a PhD). This is a seminal piece of scholarship and I highly recommend it. HOWEVER, the kindle edition is awful! Mine was missing half of the first and the entire third chapters. I promptly returned it and bought a hardback copy.Thanks but no thanks Amazon, what a failure!Also, the Kindle version does not contain traditional pages so citing is difficult.
__label__2 Greatest live album of the British Invasion: One listen to the Yardbirds take on "Smokestack Lightning" will convince you that the song' author, Howlin' Wolf, was right when he said it was the best version ever laid down. And that includes his original! "Here 'Tis" also cooks and smolders. Keith Relf's harp playing on the entire album proves that he is the best harmonica player from Britian. And he only had one lung!
__label__2 Sounds Even Better Today: Classic psychedelic rock from the 60's . Time has come today still sounding good as ever. Nice soul toneswith the rest of the album to cut away from the hard edge title song. But still a must have for anyone who remembersthe 60's sounds and loves those long play jams that never seem to end.
__label__2 Heart + Soul: Stunningly beautiful. Richard Buckner's voice is sad, longing and beautiful. I picked up the album (way back in '97) after hearing him perform the songs on a local radio station. I was mesmerized. At the time I had no clue about "Alt country", the words and his voice were heart and soul. Every time I listen to the album, I feel a mix of emotions. (From feelings of escapism, loneliness to falling in love)Lyrically, he offers little stories that constantly keep the listener intrigued. This album and the Hill are the Buckner albums that I recommend.
__label__1 Too difficult for a 6 year old: My six year old is an experienced game boy player. He very much enjoys the Rugrat movie game version. But this new version, with the promise of enticing levels to follow, leaves you that much more frustrated trying to get through the first level. The first level is incredibly monotonous and difficult. It may well be enjoyed by an older player.
__label__2 Just wish it was longer: This is a great video put together from some of the last trekking around Florida done by Acoustic Alchemy when Nick Webb was still alive, plus a live concert in a studio near where Nick and Greg Carmichael used to write a lot of their material. If you are an Acoustic Alchemy fan, this is a MUST HAVE.
__label__1 T.I. vs Covers of Songs from the Album King: Ive loved TI ever since he came out with "I'm serious". It has been downhill since then. Ive loved all of his albums except for this particular "effort." The reasong being : same beats, weak lyrics, and feeble attempts at classic one liners. See the trend? If the album were full of recycled beats and killer flows from his first effort, an entirely different story. Not the case. Don't buy this before you try this. Thanks friends.
__label__2 Simon Birch DVD: This movie is so good. I recommend it for young teens to adults, and don't forget to have tissues handy. There is a good lesson, in that, as we all know, don't judge a book by it's cover. And special people are just that, "SPECIAL."
__label__1 Terrible.: The movie had a very basic storyline, and ended on a note that didn't make sense at all. Africa is huge, and the idea that every square inch of this country he is in is swarming with the undead is highly unlikely especially due to the fact that I can low crawl faster than these zombies walk. Parts of this movie are decent but the majority of it sucks. If you want to watch a good zombie flick, click next, try something else. 4/10
__label__2 FREAK OUT HONEY! THIS BOOK IS A PARTY!!: I am so very proud of Mr. Harris. I've now completed all of his novels and this was definitely a book that made me want to dance... made me want to sing... and ultimately made me cry. I was especially moved by the ending and did not find it at all unsatisfying as I know some have suggested. I also want to recommend "The Coldest Winter Ever" and "Pseudo Cool" for additional riveting reads about African Americans. Queen Lakisha!
__label__2 Word can't discribe the item: When receiving the cd holder expecting a small and thin item, but when opened it stood out in the crowd. No mistaking the OCC logo & the Orange County Choppers on the other side. Still a good 5 star rating from me
__label__1 total disappointment: I have to give this 1 out of five stars, because I only liked two out of eleven songs. "Ain't it funny" and "Be alright" are tight tracks, laced with banging beats. "I'm real is ok too, but I don't like it as much because Ja Rule can't sing. The rest of the songs fall short of the original cd, I've only listened to the cd a few times, and wonder why I wasted my money every time I listen. The music on the other tracks don't accomodate J. Lo's voice, and sound like a bad blend of terrible buzzes and whistles and J. Lo's weak voice. I'm sure it'll grow on me sometime in the future, maybe with a few drinks or old age. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend purchasing the entire disc. You're better off buying the tracks that you like separately or getting them by some other means. ;)
__label__1 Very Weak Product: This purchase is simply not worth the expense. It is not even up to You Tube standards: no race course coverage, no compelling narrative, no sense of drama or intrigue. Money poorly spent in my case.
__label__1 The Most Stupid Book: even thou he attacks hip hop saying that it raps about groping women and treating women like objets, bill o' reilly is being hipporcillal in his book do not tresspass or what ever its called referring to his 1998 so called suspense thriller he says "ashley was now wearing only brief panties. she has signaled her desire by removing her shirt and skirt and so on....." in his books he talks about so called fisting. i think we have a hipporcite here.
__label__1 Justine, a desperate try of scandal.: I've read this book without any prior knowlogde of its content. Only background information on Sade as anyone else could have. It has surprised me the low level philosophy that he tries to work with (I have to admit that some paragraphs were too much for me so I put in practice my rudiments of quick reading methods, basically jumping words). What I find most interesting about the book is the fact that his author has passed to the history of literature just by scandalizing. This is perhaps his best contribution. For the rest a lot of sexual content with the 'morbo' of being reported by a virteous young girl. I have the feeling that some of the content of the book could be forbidden in our times with charges of pederastia if it wouldn't be a classic. Another paradox, as much of the sex-related issues in our times.
__label__2 Mac Scan: My macbook pro was really lethargically slow and I ran the mac scan it it brought MY COMPUTER BACK TO LIFE! I have cocktail but it doesn't do a very thorough job. Very good product.
__label__1 Disappointing: Totally unsatisfactory! First, to find that by "reversible" the manufacturer means only that one can mount it facing either way: second, to find one can NOT mount it either way in a sliding window, since one such direction places the adjustable shutter down, forbidding extending it.
__label__2 GREAT BOOK FOR SPORTS FANS BY:KELSEY K: Honus and Me is a great book. It's about this little boy named Joe. He loves to collect baseball cards. One day he bought a pack of cards and found a one-of-a-kind Honus Wagner card, What he didn't know was that the card had a special power, ( You need to read the book to find out)My favorite character was Joe. He was a good kid who loved baseball. I like him a lot because I am a big sports fan also.My favorite part of the book was when Joe played in the major league game. He got to experience something that no other kid has done before.I would encourage SPORTS FANS to read this book. Even if you aren't a big sports fan I still think you would really enjoy this book.
__label__2 Book makes you agree with the title: Shows you why you should avoid supporting Bush. As for me, I'm voting for Libertarian Michael Badnarik for President.
__label__2 Fun book to browse, but there are other choices, too.: Like the title suggests, this is a coffee table sized book about homes that are primarily glass, generally in the classic modern tradition. The book is in five sections: Pioneers, Glass Structures, Landscape Houses, Urban Houses, and Glass Features. It is wonderful to browse. A minor weakness in the book is the layout of some pictures; some are too small and others go on both sides of the page but the book crease sometimes interupts the flow of the picture. The text, while often useful, sometimes could have been better understood if a simple drawing of the floorplan was more often included. A good, solid and fun title to read that includes more types of buildings, like a townhouse, than in other titles. But I would consider purchasing Classic Modern; Mid-Century Modern at Home, by Deborah Dietsch, or Living Modern; Bringing Modernism Home, by Andrew Weaving before purchasing this title.
__label__1 Cheap piece of junk: This has fewer controls than the controller that came with my DVR. There is no page up or down on it. There is no Yes/No buttons to answer questions like "delete this show?" The manual was not written well in that the sequence for programming a device was incorrect. I had to mess with it for an hour to figure out the problem. Not what I would expect from Sony. I wanted a controller that would do it all. This ain't it! There were many positive reviews leading me to think this was a great controller. A pox on your reviews.
__label__2 NES vs. Yobo knockoffs: Why the guys on here despise the Yobo knockoff NES system is beyond me. You get a cheap, NEW, top loading nintendo system. You cannot buy a new NES period, so buying a used real NES, likely for more money if it is in good condition, you still take chances of the old problems those things had. Plan on blowing in the door and in the cartridges to try and get dust out and avoid the flashing screen. Nintendo is not making them anymore so it's not like they're losing money to the Yobo system. I have a yobo and while it feels cheap, it works great for the nostalgia of every once in a while old school gaming. You just don't need a real system unless you want it for a dust collector... er I mean collectible.
__label__2 A great resource on Law of Attraction: This book is a perfect companion to "The Secret". I read the book and also listened to the audio book and found them both to be very insightful, meaningful and enjoyable. I urge anyone who wants to become exposed to or learn more about this very powerful concept to purchase Hooper's book. Five stars all the way.
__label__1 stab out your eyes: Jonathan was the son of King Saul, and a friend of David, who would usurp his father's throne.I doubt Dick Bach probed that deep. I've had more insight from "Bazooka Joe" comics and gnawing the pink edible Lego brick inside.This is a `Tijuana Bible' of spirituality, and immediately reminds me of the line in Tony Hendra's `Deteriorata' "Be assured that a walk through the ocean of most souls Would scarcely get your feet wet." Fans of this book invariably live up to that.Okay, if folks are looking for spiritual enlightenment, may I suggest tackling something a bit deeper than a `metaphorical' tale of a winged crap machine? St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Augustine's `Confessions?' Even "From Reading Gaol" tops this gobswallow.Please, for the respect of your own soul, try just a bit harder than this.
__label__2 Near the Beginning of Jazz: My dad had an old vinyl E.P. of Louis' Hot Five, and those wonderful 4 songs are on this set.I'm very happy with the sound (considering the primitive state of recording in the mid/late 1920s) and very happy with the information in the booklet (although most of the songs' composers aren't mentioned).Such an education, to see the beginnings of Jump & Swing and even scat vocals. I think Louis was just as good a singer as he was a cornet & trumpet player.Amazing to hear how the rhythm went up a big notch with the arrival of Lonnie Johnson and Earl Hines.Yeah, if you wanna hear the beginnings of Jazz (and how cool it was even back then), then this a great education and musical delight.
__label__1 Worst product: Some serious problem with the lamp. Probably the worst thing I have purchased on Amazon.1. several days after normal use, it started emitting an obnoxious smell similar to what laser printer would smell during printing. After 30 minutes, the room is filled with this smell causing headache and nauseous. I'm certain it is not the heat burning the plastic. For whatever reason, this smell cannot be good for health.2. the rubber feet material left circular brown marks on my daughter's otherwise beautiful white desk. Tried all kinds of cleaners but didn't help. Not only I cannot use this lamp because of the terrible smell problem, it also ruined my furniture.3. contacted manufacture. they want you to pay the shipping to them, as well as $18 return shipping back to you. Not worth it.
__label__1 Nice capacity, but poorly fastened: I have used this bag while riding single-track trails. It is constantly coming unfastened from the bottom of the saddle. Fortunately, it has never disconnected from the seat post, so I have not lost it completely. It is still a hastle that could have been avoided with better design.Like I said in the title, it has plenty of capacity for a spare tube, tire levers, keys, etc... If you're just riding on pavement, it's probably fine.
__label__2 Outstanding: This was my first O'Reilly book, and one I've used ever since as a yardstick of what they're capable of producing.Faced with the daunting task of writing a compiler, I discovered this book and was amazed at the wealth and depth of information it contains.It could possibly do with a little extra theoretical background, but if you are looking at any sort of task involving lex and yacc or their derivatives, buy this excellent book.
__label__2 The Key is Lost: This book was an excellent outlook on life during the war. When you read from Lisa and Eva's point of view you understand what it must have been like for people during this time. This book was one of the greatest books I have ever read on the Holocaust.
__label__1 This CD-ROM is written for Windows 3.x: Since the font management has changed radically, from Windows 3.x, to Windows 95 or 98, the program cannot utilize the special characters which it needs to display the pronounciation symbols. Do not advise buying it unless you are using Windows 3.x, or if the pronounciation symbols are not importanat to you. It is excellent for other uses, however.
__label__2 Lawn Claw is a great aid: I have a huge apple tree in my yard that drops many apples to the ground. Every year, I have to rake up the 'bad' apples that drop (some of them drop with bites out of them already. I am guessing squirrels). Then I have to bag the apples. When I saw the Lawn Claw, I thought it would be a big help in scooping up the apples to get them into a garbage bag. I was right! It scoops up lots of apples at a time. The same tree will soon be dropping leaves, and once again the Lawn Claw will be a big help in picking up those leaves.
__label__2 Amazing: The fit is unbelievable, unlike most denim style pants they don't bunch up when you need to extend a leg while climbing ordered three more pairs
__label__1 Description is inadeqaute: I thought I was buying 100% recycled paper but this was only 30% recylced. The description should be more detailed and accurate.
__label__2 Seems to work.: I dont know what else to say but it dropped right in, and now that the weather is cold, it seems to be working well with my Aprilaire Humidifier. Will buy again when needed. Price was great.
__label__1 Save your money on this book.: This is just another example of a Liberal academic distorting the once sacred tradition of the Nicene Creed with his own agenda. I to have repeated and studied the creeds for years and can't disagree with Willis' views enough. I am flabbergasted at his personal emotionalized feelings of what they means or what they could mean to each individual. The Creeds have been solid (militant) foundations of truth that have brought people together in their one true faith for centuries, it was something that could be agreed upon to promote unity and community. It was more or less instituted to weed out people like Willis and his new age views that promote self central focus instead of putting Christ as the central focus. It is scary to know that this is what the so called theological elites are teaching about Christianity.
__label__1 New Medical Therapies you already know: Seems like the miracle you were waiting for. But it is [an inexpensive] leaflet kind of thing, with a overview of some trails on lung cancer. Ask your doctor or surf the web, and you will get better information on pending trails.
__label__2 You're about to enter the Lion's Den - His House!: A good friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday. Ken Shamrock is one of my favorite personalities in the wrestling world (and the martial arts world, too).This is quite a touching book. In the first half, you get to read about his life as a youth, and how Kenneth Wayne Kilkpatrick became Ken Shamrock. A nice story of hope and courage.The second half contains lots of training tips and things to improve on your fighting skills. I've taken up karate and kickboxing for about a year now, and he shares a few nice tips that I've used from time to time.I recommend this book, especially if you like to read stories about people with the drive and the urge to succeed in life.
__label__2 Great wall mount: It was cheap and it works perfectly. I mounted it twice since I moved 3 months ago. IT tilts down so I can watch TV from my Bed and can be adjusted for perfect position. It does not tilt sideways and does not stick out. I prefer that it does not stick out because I prefer to have it stick to the wall as much as possible. The only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the TV sometimes.
__label__2 Entertaining: Was a decent addition to the Madagascar trilogy. With new characters and adventures, The kids were very entertained by it.
__label__2 Great episode: If you only watch a handful of Next Gen episodes, The Best of Both Worlds Part 1 and 2 are the way to go.
__label__1 disgruntled: Sometimes we received our faxes, and other times we got blank papers. Also had problems faxing. Called Brother and they are in the process of replacing it..... hope it works better. We know it isn't our phone line because we have an all-in-one printer and when we hook it up to that machine we received every fax.
__label__2 Exactly what I needed: I was a little surprised at how light it was when it came, but with everything plugged in for about a month now, it all seems up to par. My only complaint is the little outlet covers. They are hard to slide open.
__label__1 This couldn't work less...: Got this for my foster pit-mix. She barked and stared at it a few times, then apparently got over whatever high pitched noise it made and ignored it...fail...
__label__1 Uncomfortable: I've worn Rockport shoes for years, but this is the most uncomfortable shoe I've ever worn from any manufacturer. At first I thought they just needed breaking in, but it's been a couple months now and they still hurt.
__label__2 *sniff...*: This has the start of the conclusion of Battle city.Yami Marik's face becomes more distorted than ever.The story between the Ishtars is so compelling...but it's in Japanese.I would suggest buying 31 with this one, to avoid cliffhangers and see BC's nice ending.(Marik's lovability becomes really high in 31)
__label__2 nice deal: The book is in good state and the marks help quite a lot! The content is the same as in the new edition and some of the exercises of the new one also appear in the 3rd one. So yes I recommend it!!
__label__2 Comic Crime Fiction at Its Best: Chili Palmer is a laconic tough guy who, caught up in the madcaps of the mob, becomes endearing because, unlike other mobsters, Chili has a certain humility and wisdom shining beneath his stoic persona. Because the plot is so well known through the famous film version, I will focus on the prose style. Leonard makes the prose look easy but it's not. It's really a sort of jazz riff and in an interview, if I remember correctly, Leonard says jazz fuels his writing tempo. You can see the musical quality in his playful, clean, clear prose. I've also heard that many aspiring writers try to imitate Leonard's prose style yet no one can do it. For a clinic on character study through witty syntax, Get Shorty remains one of my favorite crime novels of all time.
__label__2 DELIGHTFUL: This is a really easy to read book. Very matter of fact and as it's written by Michael Jackson himself it is a real joy. It's a very nice looking book as well and I particularly like the way his signature is on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader. It's delightful. It is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to 'hear' Michael Jackson's version and intepretation of various events, which is markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers. If you have already read books about Michael Jackson, you will recognise some of the events mentioned in the book. The reader gets an insight into Michael Jackson's interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids' interpretation of Michael Jackson's world.
__label__1 Too repetitive and simplistic: Serious Sam Next Encounter is repetitive to the point of leaving you thinking why bother. I would not describe the game as fun as such. There is no tension, no real thought required on the part of the player. It all comes down to shooting various creatures, standing you're ground until it is possible to advance forward, then you're find you're back in the same position of holding you're ground shooting more creatures. It wears thin very quickly, too quickly.Pros:There really aren't any.Cons:Linear Game play.Not very many different creatures to shoot.The lands/worlds look very basic/bland.Weak sound.Overall Serious Sam can only be described as a simplistic game with not much going for it. Not a game I would recommend.
__label__1 Barely a mention of Filipino guerilla fighters: The story is told as a celebration of the courage and skill of the American soldiers who freed hundreds of brutalized American POWs. The footage is dramatic, the heroes and their reminiscences profoundly moving.But it was the courageous Filipino guerillas -- whose stealthy reconnaissance, knowledge of the land and of the brutality of the Japanese -- who made the American rescue not only possible, but massively successful. These young men, thousands of whom died in defense of Americans here and elsewhere during the war, should be honored with so much more than the minuscule mention they receive in this film.
__label__1 Worst Organizer on Earth: This is the worst Organizer I've ever had or laid eyes on. I messed with the USB connection for hours, and the bottom line is, "It doesn't work very often!""IF" you are lucky enough to establish a USB connection, you can import or export csv files without using Outlook. However, be warned that your USB connection can, and probably will, be lost in the middle of the transfer.I didn't save my Sharp packaging, but I will try to return it anyway. I will NEVER buy another Sharp electronic device after the experience with this one.Shop around, find something that works. Your time is more valuable than messing with this Sharp "DIS-organizer."
__label__2 AWESOME!!!: First, I'll admit (and preface this review with) that I will see anything with Andy Garcia in it ..... I am a huge fan. Aside from that, this movie was AWESOME! I laughed and cried at different points throughout the movie. And, I learned of a place that I had never heard of. I will own this movie as part of my collection. Thank goodness for our little independent movie theater here in Las Cruces or I may never have have had the pleasure of seeing this film. A real winner!!!
__label__2 The Best: The best Rice book I've ever read. The best book across the board by anyone I've ever read. I lost count of how many times I've read it, and it dazzles me every single time. I would love to see this book be brought to life with full blown opera performances!A real gem.
__label__1 Yngwie unleases the fury - not!: On this CD, Yngwie demonstrates incredible guitar playing facility but also reveals anemic compositional skill. In short, the music was unsatisfying. Yngwie often says he can play violin solos such as Pagganini's 5th Caprice. It would be interesting to hear him sit in place of a solo violinist of a classical orchestra and play electric guitar to great classical pieces from composers such as J.S. Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, etc.
__label__1 Alexander the Numbskull: I'm not attacking Oliver Stone's effort or anything. I'm just saying, strictly as a member of the audience who's shelled out money with the hope of being entertained, that it's hard to enjoy a movie when you can't wait for the main character to die. Alexander leads a huge uninspired army that wants to go home. And all he does for much of the movie is force them to keep going. At some point, I could no longer sympathize with him. It would be different if his followers WANTED to conquer the world, but they didn't.
__label__2 GREAT Entry Level (and Daily Use) Yoga Program: I love this DVD so much that I've bought copies for family and friends. It is a little challenging, but I still consider it easy. I do this DVD several times a week despite no longer being a beginner. I like that you have the options of full instruction vs. the meditative quietness of minimal instruction. These two workouts are less than 30 minutes each, and I like them equally. A wonderful overall "stretch" with moments of quiet meditation. I highly recommend this DVD for beginners and anyone just wishing to have a good overall daily stretch in their lives.
__label__2 Mickey toaster: The toast has to be a little dark to see the image of Mickey, but is does work great and is fun. We did have a pop tart fall inside which took time to clean out.
__label__2 YODA IS EXCELLENT, WELL DONE: Today i went on a rampage and bought 5 figures: anakin hangar duel, padme, count dooku, mace with battle droid, and Yoda. Yoda is by far the coolest figure to get in the AOTC line so far.He looks like he's really [mad] and ready to go hard core on Dooku, who i also bought.Yoda comes with a levitating base which is pretty sick, a hard core minni green lightsaber which fits in his hand nicely, a walking stick, and blue lightning. The lightning is awesome too, you wrap it around yodas wrist and you can attach a piece of debris which comes with it (this is supposed to be him using the Force)... MAny cool accessories, and yodas body is well done too.. very well done, BUY THIS IF YOU SEE IT
__label__2 Great Mower!!: This mower does a fantastic job! As with any reel mower, you can't let your grass get to tall before mowing, or else the grass will be pushed over instead of being cut. Other than that, I will never go back to a gas or electric powered mower - this mower is low cost, quiet, and environmentally friendly! Even an electric mower produces emissions at a power plant somwhere.
__label__1 low pressure: low volume water pressure compared to my first purchase of this product, maybe due to my not purchasing the suggusted hose to go with it that i purchased with my first one purchased. Either way I am very dissapointed with the low volume of water pressure that I am now getting.
__label__1 This book stinks.: I was not impressed by this book. It was not very informative and very inaccurate.
__label__1 Very poor quality: I'm not a complainer, but I had to warn others about this extremely poor quality electronic gadget. It might be low in price, but your frustration level will be off the charts. The instrument's "power on" button sensitivity is a joke, the battery is weak and the reading changes will drive you nuts. Corolife should be ashamed of themselves for putting their name on this product.
__label__2 Good for your collection: Just having this one in your collection is great. Videos have certainly changed from the early days of Luther.
__label__2 Mtay's review: For anyone who truly loves old-school rap, this CD is definitely for you. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!
__label__1 Failure by All New Books to Deliver: My order with All New Books was placed on 2 December 2009 Two months later (4 Feb 2010) I am still awaiting delivery of the CD "Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive"I cannot recommend the service received from All New Books.
__label__2 great book: I bought this book for my wife. Now I'm going to buy it for my daughter and daughter in law. I'm even considering outlining it. The information is useful for everyone, not just women. Great book.
__label__2 One of the all time best...: It's really hard to describe this album without foaming at the mouth with praise, but I'll try. You know how there are some songs that just grab your attention and never let go (ie Born to Run and Free Fallin')? Well this entire CD is like that! The other big thing is to give the CD time to work it's magic on you. It took me around a month to fall madly in love with this album! Right now you can get a copy of Astral Weeks pretty cheap, so if you don't like it, it's not a big loss. But, if you do like it, you'll get the bargain of a lifetime!
__label__1 SecuROM is a dealbreaker: I have waited for the release of this game for years, only to discover that Electronic Arts has saddled it with SecuROM and a 3-installation limit. It is a shame that EA could not give this game and its customers a proper treatment.
__label__1 1 Star only because I did not have the option to go lower!!: I was a huge Eddings fan until I read this book. The characters are uninspired and boring. It was like reading something from a Jr. High student. If this is the best of what Eddings has left in him, then I suggest that he take up a new career. In other words I do not recommend this book. Read some of his earlier writings. Those you will enjoy.
__label__2 Erin of the irish: Omigosh! When I read this book, I fell in love with it. I have always loved the tale of Beauty and the Beast and Robin Mckinley brings it life for me! Rose Daughter is a touching book, and it has stayed will stay with me forever.
__label__2 Profound work for the soul's journey.: If you are a seeker in this life and are looking for the honest work of self revelation this book could be your catalyst for growth and joy. I found The Work to be simple, difficult, astounding, and ultimately liberating. Byron Katie offers one a key to the door of true awareness.
__label__1 An Awful Movie: The Boondock Saints is an awful movie. The script does not hold together and saying that the plot is weak is putting it mildly. The acting is 3rd rate at best as is both the direction and the special effects. Too much of the movie is clearly done for shock value alone and there is little internal consistency. There is little common sense to anything that happens in this movie. Ultimately, the suspension of disbelief is violated due to the film's manifest shortcomings.I rate The Boondock Saints at 1 out of 5 maximum stars only because there is no option to rate it at zero stars.
__label__2 Super affordable, less stick than hoped for: They get the job done for sure, but they do not have much re-stick power, and lose their stick after a while compared to other brands. Might not be an issue for some people, but I have a sticky system on my desk, so when they don't stick well it's bothersome.4 stars because it's super affordable, and you normally get what you pay for.
__label__1 getting your feet wet is only the first step: Any book that proudly uses such over-the-top buzzwords as "insider guide" and "A to Z" should really pack a lot of punch. It should be filled with useful, lengthy and original material and make the reader feel as if they have really invested their valuable time wisely.Unfortunately, the publisher name "WetFeet" speaks volumes about the severe limitations of this empty pamphlet. They are asking way too much money from people who are looking for jobs. They deliver only the bare essentials and hardly anything new or worthwhile.Tons of other books on this subject do a much better job: What Color is Your Parachute? is only one.
__label__1 Very Expensive 1-off: After this purchase I found a (full set) for nearly the same price of this -one- item. Unfortunately it was not sold through Amazon. And about a year later, I found a single like this for half the price. Yes it works and lasted about a year before it had to be replaced again.
__label__1 Horrible rack: This is a terrible rack. It does not hold the bikes on securely as the straps are weak. I've have several scary highway moments. Plus, it does not separate the bikes and scratches and dings your bikes. It is poorly designed. Additionally, you have to buy a locking hitch pin to make it secure. Do not buy it unless you want to ruin your bikes.
__label__2 Couldn't put it down: I love historical fiction so I could not put this book down! I was actually getting a little sad when I knew I was nearing the end.The Historian was the kind of book where you want to visit every place the author describes.I found myself googling images of Lake Vlad, Budapest, Istanbul...The book is lengthy, so if you're looking for a quick read, you might want to bypass this one.
__label__1 Band Seems to Mostly Just Hinder Workout: I started working out with the Ana Caban pilates dvds and wanted to try out a little variety. I purchased this dvd hoping to alternate it with my other pilates dvds and was excited to incorporate the band into some of the moves. I was disappointed, however, when just about every single move uses the band and I often found myself more distracted by it than actually focusing on getting a good workout.With Ana Caban's dvds the time seems to fly by and at the end I feel as though I got a good workout. As I tried out this dvd, I found myself relieved when the end of a segment finally came and it seemed almost never-ending as I tried to get through all five. There were certainly some good poses and instruction that were pointed out in the dvd where I learned a little something about pilates, but overall I felt bored with the workout and frustrated/hindered attempting to incorporate the band.
__label__1 Radio ratios: 2 1/2This quite abruptly moves between engaging fused funk reminiscent of Jamiroquai, and schmaltzy light jazz reminiscent of your local waiting room, unfortunately focusing a majority on the latter in vein crossover attempts when it is apparent where the talent lies. The clue as for which tracks to avoid? Pretty much anything with vocals-Mcdonalds theme and scats notwithstanding.
__label__1 A falsetto folly: You can never be quite sure as to what you are going to get when you buy a Beck CD, since he is on a proverbial audio odyssey, always exploring new forms of music. But he droped the ball (or the mirophone) on this one. A meandering eleven tracks in a 80's-ish falsetto can be tolerated for only so long, and the bitter-sweet memories that are conjured up of hot pants and teased hair is one stroll down memory lane I would refrain from taking. "Sexx Laws" is perhaps the only tolerable track on the CD, leaving the listener to wander through a bland cacophony of mixed up mixers and random disco flashbacks.
__label__1 picture is not accurate: I did not receive the product as advertised. The picture is not accurate.Instead, I received one that looked like this:My Days...My Writings (Children's Journals)I ordered the product partially based on the cover picture, which is much more inviting for children than the one I received.
__label__1 Poor quality: Be cautioned- these cd's start delaminating and skipping after a few months if used for music. CD's that were kept in jewel cases and never used after initial recording had problems. I haven't used them for data, but I imagine they'd be no different.
__label__2 real size is smaller than described: I read one customer review mentioning that the size is smaller than it describes and I did not believe it. So I measured 3 times and made the order. When it arrives, it is nice product however it is so tight on my son's head. So I lost $10 shipping fee from the refund. I will order items with free shipping only for size-sensitive products.
__label__1 Poor reproduction: I bought this thinking it was a nice little print I could frame and use for decoration. Turns out it's a photo print of the sort you see at Cost Plus or Target in their "art" sections for $4-5. Colors aren't very saturated and it lacks contrast and sharpness. I should have realized that you pretty much get what you pay for.
__label__1 Sleazy, camp Eurotrash interpretation - doesn't quite work: This Eurotrash production of the Contes d'Hoffmann almost, but not quite, pulls it off. As one would expect, the decor is ugly - lots of naked light bulbs, rotating scaffolding, man in dirty raincoats, women in stockings. The singing and music are reasonably good, but not great. But Offenbach's music is so charming that it's probably hard to destroy a score like this.Perhaps this production aimed at a genuinely sleazy, realistic interpretation of the dark side of Hoffmann, but it seems to me to have fallen short. Instead, one ends up with a rather camp production, half-way between a British Carry-On film and an am-dram play.Worth watching as an addition to better versions of Hoffmann, but don't expect too much.
__label__2 Helpful in Working With Torture Victims: I have worked with several individuals who suffered extreme physical torture sometime during their lives. Scarry's work helped me to understand the internal world of the sufferer in ways I would never have even begun to approach. Each one of these individuals lacked the language to discuss their experiences. What they were left with was inarticulatable images, physical sensations, emotions, profound helplessness and alienation. Scarry's book helped me find language to give to my patients -- language that helped to normalize their reaction to, and experience of inexplicable events. Her exploration of the abyss of human destruction is accomplished such original, humane, and thoughtful detail. Her book is an ingenius work of art.
__label__1 Wish List: I found this book very boring. I found tha language used was effective but this did not overcome the fact that the jokes made where very lame. I found it very hard to get into this book.One of the very few things i like in this bok was the relationships, such as Beelzebub and Saint Peter or Frankie and Meg. Remember this is my own personal review and you can think what you like.
__label__1 Do not try this at home.: I ordered this book and began to study the diagrams and directions. I soon found that the diagrams and the directions are not the same.The diagram will show a piece cut at 14 inches the directions say cut the same piece at 14 3/4 etc... these kinds of inconsistancies are numerous in every project and if you study the pictures it is clear that the person who built these lamps did not follow his own directions. This book was very poorly put together. I have bought many books with project plans and have never bought one with as many mistakes throughout the whole book.
__label__2 Great little tuner: Shipping was super FAST, that is always a plus.The tuner is so small I had a hard time believing it would accept a 1/4 plug... but sure enough it does.The digital face is good and I love how the meter sways just like an analog dial. Lighted arrows tell you which way to tune - green is dead on. Neat features too, like a pitch pipe and cord finder. The only thing I don't love about it is the on/off button. It can easily get pressed when not in use, but I believe it has an auto off feature so the battery life should last quite a while. I like this tuner and plan to buy a couple more.
__label__1 Rate an Item - or rate an item never delivered: I would say that for the frustration of having these on order for 5 months and still not having received them, money would be better off spent elsewhere. They look to be beautiful, and folks who actually do have these plates attest to their quality....however, they are not worth waiting for 5+ months for.Look elsewhere.
__label__2 Woodstove vac: Just got around to using this.We have a huge woodstove. heats 3,000 sq feet) My husband put the vac together and just used it. He said that any chunks larger than about 3/4 inch get stuck in the metal nosepiece. He just needed to take the nosepiece off and turn it around and suck it out and then replace it. He did this maybe 4 times while cleaning the stove. I asked him if he was not pleased with the purchase. He said," I like it a lot better than having the ash get all over the house.This is clean and if you need to dislodge a chunk or two, so what, it is still better." He is starting a new fire and the stove is clean. We only need to clean it maybe once a week. It is fired up 24/7 when it gets colder, because It is our main source of heat. We really appreciate the convenience of a vacuum that is cleaner than the ash bucket. Plus the stove doesn't have to be totally out to clean the vents and the sides.
__label__1 Had to return: The seam of the pillow cuts into your neck like a wire couldn't evern sleep one night with it...had to return :(
__label__2 Works.: It works and the performance is decent. I ordered 3 and they are actually daisy chained. WRT54G->200ft(cat6)->switch->50ft->switch->100ft->switch. No impact on internet performance at all. Did not test with LAN data transfers though. These have been reliably working for over a week. If you just need 100mbit performance, buy these.
__label__2 I'm biased. this has always been one of my all time favorites: this here is guy flick, women invited of course, however, this film captures the wanderlust of men. and the negative consequences of that wanderlust.
__label__1 Looks COOL, but that's about it: a) router is VERY noisy(if you are planning to put this router in the same room that you sleep - low pitched noise will drive you crazy)b) poor range(I placed router on the second floor - first floor doesn't have a connection. Now the question is WHY did I want the wireless router??? ahh didn't want to bother with wires... what a bummer).c) if you have 2.4 phone - connection drops immediately and doesn't get restored until you turn off your phone ...d) and the last little thing - poor admin interface:- little middle window with configuration parameters- admin password cannot be longer than 12 characters ???...And all of this after 15 min using this device....
__label__1 A complete waste of time: This is a terrible book. What little it does tell you, it repeats over and over and over and over... The tiny amount of information to be gleaned from this amateur attempt at insight into female sexuality could have been paraphrased in three sentences. 1) Don't be afraid of asking for what you want. 2) Sex is better when the woman has orgasmed first and 3) You deserve it! Get a life women and figure it out on your own.
__label__2 Singin' in the Rain: One of the greatest movie musicals -- I'd argue THE greatest. The commentaries and background material included in this package add to the pleasure of viewing this MGM classic. I first saw Singin' in the Rain as a teenager and have seen it many times since. Now, after purchasing this DVD, I am able to share Stanley Donen's and Gene Kelly's creative genius with my grandchildren so they, too, can enjoy a sample of the golden age of Hollywood's movie magic.
__label__2 Good color guide: This book is a good guide for putting together colors for decorating a home. The only thing I would have preferred is the colors of the actual paints used in the book. It would be nice to be able to reproduce the actual colors.
__label__1 The Complete Book Of Finches And Softbills: This book does not cover the different types of finches & softbills. It is very general information only, on breeding and care of finches & softbills, no help to the person wanting more specific info. on the different types of finches and their care.
__label__2 My daughter loves this!: My daughter loves this. It has been one of her favorite toys. She sleeps with it and feels protected with this plush toy. I would recommend and buy again. Shipped on time and exactly as described.
__label__2 Only God Can Judge..: If you read this book with an open mind, you would learn that the Crips gang started out as just uniting other gangs around South Central. Stan was a mischivous little boy who I believe had potiental to do great things if only he was given the opprutunity. He says that living in South Central you had to have the mentality of "Survial of the fittest". And that's where the fights with other males really began, I believe. Much of the information about his case is left out but there are clues that connect someone else to the crimes. Hint: The people who let him keep his weights at their house after not having a permenant place to stay. Right before his grandmother died she said she had a feeling that Stan needed to get outta LA because something bad was going to happen.I'm going to stop there and hopefully this information has interested you enough to read this wonderful book that will hopefully open your eyes to a positive light.
__label__2 So much packed into this book!: Just about anything you want to know about finances, Suze has packed in this book. Even things you thought you knew she has gone into detail and you can learn something new. Also, she has done a great job in motavating people to move forward and take care of business.
__label__2 An Unparalleled Book on Golf: A better collection of essays about golf has never been produced. Following Through is a collection of 27 of Herbert Warren Wind's essays from the New Yorker magazine. You will find yourself rereading this book and recommending it to others. Get it.
__label__2 Great feature, better price: This camera is great for the price. It has many feature that enhance the thought that is still a sub200.00 camera. The size and weight is incredible. One draw back is the size of the viewfinder, it rather small. If you dont need or can afford a digital camcorder, then this is perfect for filming parties, and events.
__label__2 well done, but doesn't have the battery saving auto off: Its a wonderful camera with all the nice features. I really liked it. I have used it on a trip to Niagara Falls and the photos came out fantastic even in low light. My only negative about this is that it doesn't have the auto shutoff feature.
__label__2 Great Mix: I love Everything But the Girl. The faster songs on this album are where it's at for me. DJ Slyside will rave about the slower ambient pop tracks because that's his bag. Ben really throws down some serious beats on this album. Tracy's always on.
__label__1 Not as good as Wen: I bought this because I like Wen but not the price tag. DermOrganic does have a nice lather but thats it. It left mine and my 3 yr old daughters hair so dry that I couldnt even brush through it while it was wet. I noticed that her hair has been very tangley since using it. Im returning it and going back to Wen..
__label__2 You Can't Bring This Down: After Fireproof, Pillar became my favorite band, and after this cd, they're even better. This album totally rocks! the sound is a little different, but change is definetly good in this case. Fireproof was trip hop rapcore, this album is more towards hard rock and its great. The guitar is better then any band i've ver heard and is not just basic chords, Noah Henson can really play. The lyrics are great and send a great message. BUY THIS CD!!
__label__2 Great family flick!: This is one of my 7-yr-old's favorite movies. We all find it really funny and very well-written. This movie has such a great line-up of actors too, and it doesn't disappoint. We've watched it a dozen times easily.
__label__2 Graceland: Graceland. This is a classic recording by Paul Simon. The 25 yr. documentary on PBS showing the history of its making was excellent.
__label__2 Definitely riding under the radar...: I heard "Change Me" on a smoothe jazz internet station and immediately downloaded it to my ipod. Then I had to see if this was a one track wonder and to my surprize, the whole cd is off the chain!! I don't know why they don't play more of their music on the smoothe jazz stations in the LA area. They appear to be one of those great performance bands with great chemistry with one another. Each instrument compliments the other. This is a new "driving down the highway" favorite for me.
__label__1 Price and quality: Perhaps my video system is NOT calibrated to the right extent and I have just seen the first part of this Blue ray disc, but I am here to find out if I was hoodwinked by Amazon.com. The price of the DVD version is higher than that of Blue Ray version! Also, I think the DVD version came out first whereas Amazon.com advertised the disc as playable only on Blue Ray players and did not show the DVD version. I bought at the same time a Walmart disk which, with my current calibration plays better. Now I find this disk is the last option in Blue ray versions of Carmen.
__label__2 Very useful diagnostic tool for DIY car repairs: This diagnostic tool helped me identify and repair a problem in the heated oxygen sensor (HO2S), which would cost more than $300 at minimum in some repair shops. It was a great experience to be able to find the problem and do the repair by yourself. Great buy!
__label__1 Lacks a purpose and climax: This book starts out rather interesting, but after that it is all downhill... By the end of the book you are left wondering what happened to the plot. This book completely lacks a climax. I would definitely recommend not reading this book, unless you're very interested in horse racing and politics. I was told it was supposed to be a mystery about the main character, Ben, abusing drugs, but the majority of the book was about Ben's father running for Parliament. I am not a political person so this did not interest me at all.
__label__1 Actually not that bad.: Let's see if I got the plot to "Candy Stripe Nurses" correct. I believe it went something like this: topless woman, topless woman, naked woman, topless woman, naked woman, topless woman, 2(!!) topless women. There was also a subplot about one of the nurses trying to help a patient beat a charge of armed robbery.In all seriousness, I rather enjoyed parts of this movie. I know this is going to be hard to believe, but the acting by the women playing the nurses was wonderful. Usually the women in these types of movies simply have to speak English and look good without their clothes on. (Although sometimes the speaking English part isn't necessary.) Every one of the actresses in "Candy Stripe Nurses" did an admirable job and all of their characters were sympathetic ones. That really helped to partially overcome the cheesy plot. I've seen A LOT worse '70s movies similar to this one. Kinda fun little flick...but nothing that'll blow you away.
__label__1 Caution: This is Poison!: I first encountered this book in 4th grade when a girl in my class did a research project on witches. It looked good to me and I asked her where she got it. Now, years later, after I finally have a true concept of Wicca and the Rede, I picked up this book. As soon as I flipped to the "Black" magick section, I put it back on the shelf as if I had touched something that scalded my fingers. If anyone has half a concept of ethics and 'right-and-wrong', they will steer clear of this book and anything else by the same author. As soon as I put this book down on the shelf, I knew I had wasted my time even looking at it. Don't even think about wasting yours.
__label__1 Programming and Problem Solving with Java: I purchased this book to use as a text for a beginning programming class and found the programming logic to be adequate, but overall I am not impressed with the way the author tries to teach Java in the text. I found his outline to learn and his methods of teaching the basics very poorly laid out. I feel it did not teach the basics of learning programming in any language, much less Java. What it did address, I don't feel it was presented in the proper order...he tried to teach you how to run before you even knew that you had feet. I would not recommend using this book to learn Java. This book was my initial exposure to programming and the only thing I learned for sure is that there has to be a better way to learn Java, or any other programming language, than the author presents in this book.
__label__2 Artie Lange's Beer League: Very Good movie. For the money spent making it, it's a home run. Better than some big budget films, I watched it 2X during the first week after getting it. Only down side is that Artie is trying to steal all the funny lines and not letting all the other cast members having their fair share of zingers. But overall a very good movie.
__label__1 ok, not as good as the previous REs: i love biohazard/resident evil. unfortunately, capcom changed a few things that were staples of RE: 1) no item boxes. what the heck were they thinking? 2) instead of letting the story put you in control of another character, which was very cool in previous REs, you have to keep track of two characters at all times in this one. big mistake. it was much more frightening when you were off adventuring around in creepy mansions or wherever by yourself, only to run into other people infrequently. solving puzzles/perfoming tasks with two players [stinks]. and you'd better make sure you're in control of rebecca at all times because if you try to run away and there are two zombies around her she is so weak that she will die almost immediately which is... since you as the player didn't do anything wrong. i did give RE0 2 stars though because it is an incredibly gorgeous game.
__label__1 Talk Fast..............: Save your $$ and pass on this P.O.S. - I have suffered with this phone for almost a year now and am shopping for a replacement. The Battery life is almost non existant and has been from the beginning. After sitting in the charger overnight it dies within the first 10 minutes of making a call. Thought about replacing the battery, but I hate this phone so much I don't want to even look at it anymore. The Telezapper feature didn't seem to slow the telemarketing vultures down much either. I'm leaning towards a Panasonic or Uniden - wish me luck!!
__label__1 book: did not find this story as one the granddaughters really liked. they have so many books it is hardto tell if they look and read it often
__label__1 Jackie Collins she is not!!!: I thought this book would follow in the tradition of a Jackie Collins novel....NOT. I found that I hated most of the characters in this book so I did not care what happened to them. I forced myself to read the entire book to see if it got better but it did not.
__label__1 Vintage? More like "vintage inspired": Reading other reviews, I heartily agree with the problems of this book. I've just checked it out and I'm glad not to have paid for it! I'm a small girl myself, so no size problems...but really all the fab style details I was hoping for are not there!I appreciate confusing old patterns being modernized, but really these are so far modernized as to lose their vintage charm. Some of the patterns I wouldn't recognize as being vintage style at all. The beaded sweater is especially maddening--the original has the daintiest collar, pretty shaping and is so cute. The modern version? not really anything special. I've seen other books that gave the original pattern too--I'd have sorely appreciated that here so I could hybridize the two patterns a bit!In short...request this from your local library like I did or get on Ravelry for your vintage sweater fix!
__label__2 A Moving Story of Survival and Triumph of the Spirit: An incredible true account of the author's experience of incest at the hands of her mother. Sandor's story is courageous, and although hellish to imagine, ultimately a testament to the healing that is possible. The writing and poetry are honest and candid without being self-indulgent. This book is a beacon for anyone who has survived sexual abuse, anyone hoping to help someone who has been victimized in this way, or anyone who wishes to be reminded of the strength of amazing grace.
__label__2 Bearpaw demi boot: I actually like this very much, its very soft and comfortable. but ifeel the size may run small. i ordered a 10 and it fits snug and my footis a 9 1/2 actually. Overall its a great boot purchase.
__label__1 Failed after 4 months.: Got this 4 months ago and it worked great until 2 weeks ago. Now the red lights on the front blink to show that it has a signal, but the base unit doesn't emit any signal. I was able to plug in the wired extender LED and that is working for now. I was initially very impressed by this product, but after seeing other one-star and two-star reviews on here where they've had the same problem, I'm now not so impressed.
__label__1 Not Comfortable: If I could rate this 0 stars I would. Although the package says "Improved fit" it is not true. The underwear feel like they are two sizes smaller than they are supposed to be. Since they are cotton, they will shrink, therefore, it was a waste of money to purchase these. I have worn this brand for many years and have never had a problem. The other thing that I noticed about these is that they do not have JMS logo printed on the wasteband, so that just makes me wonder if these are truly JMS??? I purchased the other package with the variety of colors and those fit perfectly.
__label__2 Awesome lotion: Have been using this moisturizer for many years, previously bought from a local salon. This large size is awesome, I do not run out and have to depend on someone else having it.
__label__1 I didn't get Techno Bears, I got standard Haribo bears: The product I got, the standard Haribo Golden Bears, get five stars. I didn't order Haribo Golden Bears, I ordered the Techno Bears. Pretty disappointing, be careful about ordering.
__label__1 I found the book to be disturbing propaganda.: I found the book to be very moving. The violence, disceit and corruption that is inherent to drug prohibition (as it was to alcohol prohibition) causes one to wonder why we as a nation don't consider alternative harm-reduction techniques and strategies to help reduce the frequency, as well as the destructive and harmful effects, of drug abuse. Mr. Lightfoot's story is very disturbing, but are we ready to give up more and more of our liberty, privacy, and rights in the name of the drug war-a war that has proven itself a failure, often making problems worse by making the drug trade more violent and prosperous, while making the drugs themselves more dangerous through adulteration and misrepresentation? Education is the answer, not incarceration; not just for the drug abusers, but for the rest of us as well.
__label__2 A fine novel and a great series: Knots and Crosses introduces the reader to Inspector Rebus, a somewhat inexperienced police officer in a precinct in Scotland. This is a long series that culminates with Exit Music (featuring a much more experienced, wisened Rebus). The inspector is a womanizer, a bit of a slob, a smoker, a frequent drinker (though probably not crossing into the alcoholic category). Though he would not admit it, here he is reliant on the smarts and help from his coworkers.A string of murders of children horrifies Scotland and seems to be linked to the inspector's own history. He will have to work hard to save people most precious to them. Here he is not quite the inquisitive, smart investigator that he becomes in the finale but this is a great book with which to start the series. Recommended.
__label__1 It's a $30 table: This is a $30 table. Nothing more. It most likely will arrive scratched. Don't get me wrong, it is ok for $30, but not much more. If you are looking for a high quality, sturdy table look elsewhere.
__label__1 Fair: Fairly good, could of been much better. Very nice Photography, very limited information about things to do with too much emphasis on certain stores and hotels instead of sights. Note - This video is only about 22 minutes long. Subtract the intro and closing and you only have about 15 minutes of usable information.
__label__1 Big Letdown: I found this book to be poorly edited and very repetitive. If your looking for some inside stuff on the President and behind the scenes stories, read something else, you won't find it here. There is a constant repetition of "we board the plane, we eat, watch a movie, land, go to the hotel, sleep, I get up early and print the news clips, and deliver them to everyone on the list." There's nothing more in this book. The author does provide vivid detail on every meal and article of clothing he wore, for some strange reason. Chitester has absolutely nothing to say which is in the least bit controversial about anything. I consider myself a junkie for this type of subject matter and after one chapter I was bored to death. In regards to my comment about editing, there were many repetitions in the text from one paragraph to the next i.e., the book constantly repeated peoples' titles in perenthesis with almost every mention of the person's name. I will try again with Stephanopolis or Isikoff.
__label__2 Scary profiles...: This book really went into detail about the lives of many female murderers throughout the united states. Their lives, their loves, losses, and what led up to their crimes. Most dont explain WHY they did it, but its good enough if you want to step into the lives of real viscous women killers!
__label__2 Only a matter of time...: You're crazy not to snatch up this album. She is such an amazing artist and even better person and you can hear it in every line!!!
__label__2 Addicting for a good reason: Everquest is a game which has pretty much revolutionized the MMORPG by drawing hundreds of thousands of gamers into an immersive fantasy world that some find hard to leave.Every time a new game comes out AO, DAOC, etc. everyone predicts to downfall of EQ but it never happens and this expansion will put EQ back on the same page as these new games graphics wise. In addition to the new eye candy this expansion also brings with it a new race and an entirely new class the Beastlord. This new expansion takes place on the moon and promises many new zones for all levels 1-60.
__label__1 Sucks ass: I thought this would be the sound track of the entire movie. Not just some sucky b2k. The only cool song on here was the last Track "Ante up". Im extremely dissapointed.
__label__2 Also an excellent text/reference for graduate level Radiobiology students (like RA's): While this reference has been used by Radiologists and residents in Radiology for a number of years, the emergence of post Certification (at the Baccalaureate and Masters Level)programs of study has created a new audience for this text. It does an excellent job presenting material beyond the RT / Associate Degree level courses.
__label__2 Nice and Simple: I use Nero 7 and Windows burning options as well, but I have found this little program to be much easier for my children and myself if we need either data or audio in quick time. It burns both CDs and DVDs.If you don't need all the bells and whistles and want a simple yet effective burning program I highly recommend this one. It is great for archiving, burning document and school work.
__label__1 Strictly for Fans: Unless you're a rabid fan of Frampton it's kinda sad seeing him up there with this lacklustre band churning out those classics from Frampton Comes Alive - sure, his voice is totally intact, his guitar playing is all there and he looks healthy enough (although it's pretty hard reconciling this trim, greying and bespectacled mid-lifer with the image of that 70's rock star with the Roger Daltery-esque curls.) But it's a pretty shlocky concert and it just lack all the elements that defined him as a terrifically talented and cool star in the 70's.The sound quality (on DTS) is fine so I give this one two stars.
__label__1 Cypress Gardens: 70 Years of Magic - Volume 1: For a documentary, this was little more than a tourist video with musical background. Nothing about the water sky shows, the flower ladies. Not one word of dialogue. Don't waste your money.
__label__2 Fantastic book....!: I read Holes many times though I already knew the whole thing. Sachar gives pieces of information that you don't know what to do with and it starts to add up with things. It's not a mystery but I think people who enjoy reading mysteries would find this book amusing. I highly recommend it.
__label__2 Powerful Story: Where There's Smoke by Kristin Hardy is an emotional, touching book.Inventor Sloane Hillyard has vowed to save firefighter lives with her Orienteer System. Her brother died in a fire and Sloane doesn't want another loved one to suffer such pain. She has her work cut out for her in convincing firefighter Nick Trask to test her product.Captain Nick Trask has been through the promises of new, better and safer equipment before. Once the elections are over the budget is cut and no new equipment can be bought. So he is not very open to Sloane and her invention. But after a few test runs he sees its value. He also sees something in Sloane.Sloane and Nick start a temporary affair but it turns deeper for them both. But Sloane isn't sure she can afford to lose another loved one to a fire.Where There's Smoke is a sensational book. You feel like you are there right in the middle of the fires. Sloane and Nick are a compelling couple and you find yourself routing for them to succeed.
__label__1 Worked until after the 90 warranty was up: This fax machine was a dream compared to our ten-year old machine we had been using in my office. That is until it just stopped working and we sent it to a Sharp Service center for repair. I was told that the cluth on the paper feed was broken(through no fault of our own)and that the repairs would cost 130.00. Fifty dollars more than we paid for it. We had this for 8 months and the warranty runs out after 90 days. How convenient.
__label__1 Defective: Unfortunately ordered these a couple of months ago and just got them out to put them on. Great big hole where one of the big toes should be. Open and inspect in detail immediately if you buy these, I have missed the return cut off - so it's a complete rip off.
__label__1 I can't wait to have a million of you disagree with me but...: While the music is "interesting" to say the least, the singer crushes any hope of this band becoming great with his pre-pubescent voice. I'm not just saying this album is trash..they all are, and it's giving ROCK MUSIC a bad name.
__label__2 Phenomenal, charismatic, spiritual: If you have a pulse, you will love this CD. It really brings the urban Latin right up to date with street-corner sounds and ironic post-9/11 lyrics. Your grandma and your kids will love it. Much cheaper than a week in Rio.
__label__2 You've got your best Ripper book at last!: This is the best book I've read on the subject in terms of its comprehensiveness, readability, and especially of its emphasis on recognizing and debunking long-held myths, fallacies, and factual inaccuracies about the murders. The research done for the book is thorough, the presentation of the facts is organized, explanations on why certain "facts" are myths are lucid, and the author's theories on who Jack the Ripper might or might not be are fascinating.
__label__1 Damaged goods... Pay attention to vendor name.: The item was damaged, and previously a returned item. Half of the wire top was not attached.Guessing from the vendor name and the fact that this was a previously opened item, I believe it was a defective item. The vendor is less than scrupleous to send defective items... fool me once... never again!
__label__2 jimmy thackery solid ice: i have most of jimmy thackery's cds,and i think this is pretty equal to his others.
__label__1 product needs work and support: I purchased the scanner and set up the software. I scanned in three slides in TIF format and got 45-47 gig files. Intelli scan didn't work. Support for either the software or hardware is available in Germany and Taiwan only with only local phone numbers. After 3 days of screwing with it with no progress made, I returned it.Thank the Lord Amazon allows returns!
__label__2 Great soundtrack for a great movie: One of the things I love about this soundtrack is that my teen son wanted it after seeing the movie repeatedly. I found him playing it, loudly, while playing LOTR games. What a great way to introduce children to orchestra and choral music!Dramatic, haunting, harrowing, so many words seem weak.
__label__1 I loved it until the last fifty pages......then I was disappointed: The book worked for 90% of the way...recounting the usual New York social scene that has become McInerney's calling card. However, the last fifty pages were disjointed, seemed as if they were unedited, and ultimately, the ending was not only disappointing, it didn't seem to fit with the way the two leading characters had been portrayed earlier. This is actually one book I wish I hadn't finished....I would have liked it more.
__label__1 Growing old waiting for toast: My husband and I couldn't agree whether to give it 1 or 2 stars. It looks fine and it hasn't broken - the buttons haven't drooped off or anything but at the end of the day we bought it to cook toast and boy it's slow.I put the first set in when I was 35 and recently turned 42 before it was done. Would be quicker to put the bread out on the balcony in the sun. The elements don't even visibly glow but it gets there in the end. So if you're not in a rush it's OK but frankly disappointing.
__label__2 Great book!: I bought this book and cd for my 2 year old son for Christmas. He LOVES it! With its rhyming words and bright colorful pictures this story had no problem keeping his attention. It's a cute story and has a good lesson to it too. The Cd is fun to listen to in the car and my son even sings along. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is one phrase in the song that was left out of the book when I recieved it.
__label__1 Broken guide combs -- can't use anymore: I started with the 1" guide comb, the clips on that broke so I switched to the 3/4", when that broke I used the 5/8", but now that's broke and I am not going to use the 1/2", it makes me look like a drill sergeant. To think I bought the Remington instead of the Vidal Sassoon because I thought it would be sturdier. It's built for very delicate users.
__label__1 What's the big deal?: Another wanna be punk group. One thing for sure, they took AC/DC's sound. I'm not a huge fan of AC/DC, but it's wrong to take some other band's hard earned sound, just because you can't come up with one yourself. Be inspired by a group, not rip off the group.Second of all, all their songs sound EXACTLY the same. I'm not kidding. The lyrics are kinda stupid and the songs can get repetetive. I gave this CD two stars because I liked the songs Friends like mine and Fall Behind Me.Unfortuantely, my friend has become brainwashed to this crap.If you are a fan, please don't be offended. It's my opinion, so deal with it.This group just isn't that good.Like I said before, if you like this group, like it. But if you want something a bit better, try Nirvana.
__label__2 10-year old really likes it: Bought this as a Christmas present. Ages on the book say 7-10 but I'd say it could be used for ages 11 and 12. Devotions seem to be age-appropriate and easy to read, but thought-provoking.
__label__1 Better rules...: Rule # 1 - Don't employ the suggestions that these writers advocate in their dating manuals or you will never get married in the first place.Rule # 2 - Don't take marital advice from a woman whose marriage failed. That's like the blind leading the blind. Logically, if you follow her advice and she ended up divorced, wouldn't you also end up divorced?Rule # 3 - Read I Corinthians 13. Then live it. You can't account for your spouse but living those rules might invite him to do the same. If both of you do so, you will have little use for this book.
__label__2 Love it: Great! I love this! Super shipping speed!I am happy to buy this product.This seller is so kind!Love
__label__1 Rabbit Cage: I need to amend my previous review of this product due in fact to a weld that connects the wheel to the bottom of the cage that broke. The product was not packaged in a way that prevented it from becoming bent in several places thus making it hard enuff that I literally broke my thumb trying to assemble it and required emergency service on my thumb. I have no intention on paying to ship it back to the seller as I am already out enuff money from purchasing the cage plus hospital expenses and lost time from work. I feel it will be a matter of time before more or all of the welds around the wheels will break.
__label__2 Terrific in tough situations: I carried this camera in my pants pocket while climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro in Africa. It survived several falls onto lava, tropical weather at the bottom, frigid glacial weather at the top (19,344 feet above sea level), and worked flawlessly without complaint. Battery life was much better than expected. I was truly impressed with its ruggedness, and thrilled with the pictures. I'll post one of sunrise over Mawenzi Peak.
__label__1 First flight game I ever owned and now I know why...: Just bought an Xbox 360 on 9/24 and got this game along with it. Usually when buying games I just look at who made it. Noticed this was ubisoft I thought this is going to be a great game... I have played over 30 hours of scenario mode, at first it was ok but not really that fun. The missions get progressively harder. An example of this would be soon as some of the later missions start enemys are already fireing missles at you and your dead, that is on easy... Definetly would not spend 60 bucks on this game I did and was a mistake. I am only going to beat this game because of the guilt for the money it cost me. The height of this game realm would be throwing it in the toilet and flushing it.
__label__1 Dumb.: As a fan of The Scarlet Pimpernel, I looked forward to this book very much; thankfully, I got it out of the library rather than paying for it. I read the book in one sitting with a growing sense of frustration--nothing seemed real. The characters were completely modern, the war seemed more like a trip to Disneyland than a dangerous thing, and the characters were so dumb they deserved to get caught spying. There was no sense of realism to the book. Perhaps I expected the wrong thing, but this book seems almost disrespectful to the people who suffered during the time the book is set, as it has utterly no concept of their suffering.
__label__1 ABSOLUTELY!!! THIS is NOT a book...it's an advertising CIRCULAR!!!: I also got ripped off by someone selling this on ebay WITHOUT a picture. This is an advertising piece for Ken Roberts' company, and is designed to SELL the actual product by that title. IT IS NOT A BOOK AND SHOULD NOT BE SOLD AS SUCH. Consider it like you would the weekly store circular you get in the mail for some of the chain stores!
__label__1 Little bit disappointed...: I was over sea having 5 years old son, who was a bit out of control. I looked for help in this book. Well, I guess working with children, nothing is easy and simple, there isn't one answer what to do to correct child behavior. Coming back to United State, his behavior got much better, I guess being in the different country, away from home, it created large amount of stress on him to miss behave. It's good book, but have lot of work to do.
__label__2 Best purchase I made this year: This is a fabulous device!!!! I slip it into my purse to be able to read whenever I can - there is absolutely no bulk. I do recommend also buying the cover case and in my case the mini-light to go with the Kindle. I love my favorite newspaper (USA Today) delivered to my Kindle every Mon-Fri - not available in Hawaii -- Kindle has all the latest books - actually - I think - everything that anyone could ever want to read and then some - Whenever I have typed in a book title to inquire - it is either already there or available to pre-order. When I'm done with a book or newspaper it is a click away to delete - I absolutely recommend this to any avid reader - it's the best purchase I've made this year (and I make a LOT)!!!
__label__2 Excellent How-to guide!: Bulletproof Web Design tackles some of the common design problems on modern websites. Each chapter takes the approach of defining a problem, usually in the context of what was wrong with the old table-based, inaccessible approach, and showing how to implement it using CSS and XHTML. The book is very readable. The examples are concise and clear and with plenty of pictures.Topics covered:- techniques for defining boxes with rounded corners, that can be made expandable- planing for accessibility by organizing the page logically and allowing the text to be resized without making the page look bad- using floats to achieve grid-like appearance (instead of tables)- handling vertical expansion- fluid layoutsI also recommend these books on CSS:Accessible XHTML and CSS Web Sites Problem Design SolutionandCSS: The Missing Manual
__label__1 a total downer -- waste of money: this author doesn't write all that well and doesn't say anything profound. pretty hackneyed stuff.
